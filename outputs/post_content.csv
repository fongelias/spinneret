            UpdatesOriginal Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i7wkqu/i_30f_caught_my_husband_31m_in_an_affair_and_i/First of all, I just want to thank everyone here for the support I received following my first post back in August. At the time, it truly felt like my world was ending. It was important to me to make this update because I need to tell anyone who’s currently going through the same thing—IT GETS BETTER. You will get so much better.I had one conversation with my husband since everything happened—by his choice. It lasted maybe five minutes and was like talking to a robot. I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret. At this point, I don’t care. I know him and the other woman are still seeing each other and frankly, they deserve each other. Good for them.While I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, I’m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how I’ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house.  I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, I’ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and don’t feel guilty. It’s so refreshing.I have dipped my toe into the dating pool again and had plenty of mediocre dates from dating apps. Recently, I found someone who I’ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired he’s made me feel.  It’s definitely early and we’re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that I’m a catch who doesn’t have to settle.Therapy has done wonders and I’m so happy I immediately dove into it. My therapist is proud of me. I’m proud of me. I’ve stopped looking at being divorced as a failure. He failed—not me. I’m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything.So all in all, life is good and there’s so much of it ahead. Looking back, I can’t believe I wasted so much time thinking about how I could get him to come home. I’ve made my own home and my own happiness and that is worth so so much more.TLDR; Husband left me for another woman. He sucks, but things get better.380 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted

He found my eyelash curler and asked what it was for and I told him how to test it on himself. He said he didn't notice any difference but his eyes sparkled for the first time.He's not going to keep doing it but at least I know what his pupils look like now lolTL;DR: I didn't ask him, he asked me.248 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
lxp1ee,11.4kPosted by7 months agoArchived71034UPDATE: Me [36 M] married to my Wife [36 F] 11 years, and I can't stop thinking about a girl I dated for 1 month 16 years ago.
              
            UpdatesOriginal Post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lqpshq/me_36_m_married_to_my_wife_36_f_11_years_and_i/So I mentioned to my wife vaguely that I was having a bit of a midlife crisis and ruminating on my past a bit too much. That I miss how I was physically at my peak in college.She said she is also having a bit of a crisis, worried about longterm health and missing the shape she was in before kids.We made a commitment to each other to get into shape and have changed our eating habits and bought a treadmill. I have been working out daily and my rumination issues have really dwindled. We also planned a nice vacation, and a few get togethers with frends in the next few months.tl;dr: Told wife I was having a crisis without much detail. We are making strides to better ourselves and each other.207 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
hxzwcl,8.1kPosted by1 year agoArchivedUpdate: My(M26) wife(F26) is not happy
              
            UpdatesOriginal Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hm1wdi/mym26_wifef26_isnt_happy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfThank you everyone for the advice from the original post. I just wanted to give the community an update. My wife finally got back yesterday from leaving to go see her sister. We talked for a little bit yesterday, but still came to the same thing she has been telling me. She doesn’t want to be with me because she doesn’t feel in love, emotionally connected, or intimate towards me. She views me as a friend. I told her she needed to choose either we work on this and go to counseling or it’s a divorce and we cut ties. She couldn’t decide and said to give her the weekend.This morning I woke up early, made her breakfast and brought it to her in bed. Then took her out to eat for lunch and desert trying to just spark anything to see if she would agree to work on it. Well we sat down again after getting back and she said she wanted a divorce and she was 100% on that.It was tough. A lot of crying, sadness, hurt, and all the emotions one would feel. I ended up just going to my room and she left for the night. I decided to get out and do something so I jogged and listed to some music for a bit. It helped.I came to the realization that we all have such little time on earth and I don’t want to waste it moping around. I want to improve myself physically, emotionally, and mentally. I want to just enjoy life and find myself again. So I’m going to do that and one day I might meet someone who is perfect to continue the journey of life with me.So I’m still sad and hurt, but all that to say I’m moving forward and trying to be positive. Thank you all for your support.tl;dr Wife wants a divorce. I’m trying to stay positive and move one.421 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
nhr3yo,8.0kPosted by5 months ago491016UPDATE : I (46F) have hurt my daughter (16F) by giving her friend(16F) a few books
              
            UpdatesOriginal postI found the perspectives and guidance I received really helpful. I decided to just spend some time with her. She loves to bake and we baked together and we had some movie nights. her comments melted away and she became happier.we were baking yesterday when she came out to me. I didn't make a big deal out of as I felt she didn't want me to. I just told her I loved her before continuing to bake as if nothing happened. We did have a conversation later on.She told me that she and her friend had been together ( scary, how well kids can hide things.) Her girlfriend wanted to come out but she didn't and it had strained their relationship. It seems, they had a fight before we gave her the books to her (ex?) girlfriend and that had hurt her. Their relationship is in the limbo and she doesn't want to come out to the world right now. My husband ordered a small pride flag to keep in her room. The world is a bit crazy right now and we want her to have a space where she can be herself.TL;DR : My daughter came out to me, her friend was actually her girlfriend and they had a fight.129 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
l5jc7c,7.3kPosted by9 months agoArchived8221515UPDATE: My (29M) soon to be ex-husband seems to feel entitled to another chance with me (28F).
              
            UpdatesLink to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gklndb/my_29m_soon_to_be_exhusband_seems_to_feel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfWell, turns out my gut instincts were right. The entire time he was begging for another chance and promising “this time would be different” (eye-roll) he was still sleeping with the affair partner and telling him he loved her and would do anything to make it work with her. It didn’t even hurt me to find it out. I was THAT unsurprised. It just helped me stop feeling guilty. I divorced his ass.I thank the universe every day that he is no longer connected to me in a romantic way. It feels like an ENORMOUS weight has been lifted off my shoulders.Shortly after my original post I met someone by chance at a wedding and fell in love. This person is everything my ex husband was not. The kindness, compassion, and respect they show not just me, but to my daughter as well, is like something from a dream. I never knew love could be so easy.To anyone in a loveless marriage reading this-LEAVE. Do the hard thing- ESPECIALLY if they have a pattern of leaving/returning/cheating, etc. Lord knows I was terrified to cut the cord. At one point in time I was actually starting to feel bad for the guy because he was begging me every single day for another chance. He tried to convince me that getting a divorce would ruin my future, our daughters future, that she would come from a “broken family”- but it was the exact opposite. It was broken already and I fixed it. Once I made up my mind that divorce was the best option, I absolutely thrived. I learned independence. I found how to be happy on my own. I found happiness in a partner. Life has never been so sweet. The bad shit makes the good shit so much better. Thank you, Reddit, for the support on my original post. It helped turn my graveyard into a garden.TL;DR: I divorced him and found true happiness.160 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
hfwaxf,6.8kPosted by1 year agoArchived3UPDATE to “I'm unhappy with how my (24 F) boyfriend (26M) treats me, but he won't listen to me for long enough for me to get my point across”
              
            UpdatesHere is the original post:https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/grls25/comment/fs2iubn?context=3Tldr: confronted my bofriend about how he treats me after asking for advice on reddit. He cried and talked about his issues, we broke up. I'm much better for it. Firstly, thank you to everyone who commented on my original post. I got so much from it, and seeing so many supportive comments really helped me. I learned a lot, so thank you all so much. I realised through reading your comments that I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. It wasn't communication tips I needed, I needed to get out. The past month has been so up and down but I wanted to share an update. After a pretty weird “stepping on eggshells” kind of morning, I confronted him about his behaviour and mood swings. I prepped myself for a huge argument and honestly it didn’t go exactly as I expected. First of all he started to deny he was doing anything wrong, but for once I stood my ground. I don’t think he was expecting that. I had lots to say (many of your comments came in useful there), and I tried so hard not to back down. After a while he kind of… changed. He got upset. He then started saying all sorts of things, that he was sorry but he didn’t realise how his behaviour affected me (though I’d brought it up many times). A little later on he said that he had been thinking for a few months that it was his fault my doctor said I had depression. So that’s a huge contradiction?? He said that for a few weeks he had been thinking about breaking up with me “because it’s my fault that you are this way and breaking up sooner would have been the noble thing to do”, but that he was so torn for ages. He said that’s why he had been even more awful to me lately, that his frustrations were just coming out. Again, contradicting what’s he said about not realising how his behaviour affected me. He said he has never cheated but I’m really not sure if I believe that. Maybe it’s best if I don’t know.Then something really unexpected happened, he started to cry, the first time I have ever seen him cry. He told me that he had been texting a work friend over the past few days about our relationship. He even showed me a message she sent to him which went something like this: “you have a wonderful, textbook girlfriend and you are fucking it up because you are being an ass. This is why everyone at work thinks you’re a psychopath. You are so cold and bad when it comes to feelings”. So I guess it wasn’t just me who found his behaviour not normal??He cried even more and said that he doesn’t feel close to people, that there’s only a handful of people he lets in and he doesn’t know why he does that. He said that even being around his immediate family was cold and formal and he doesn’t know why he is like that and can’t connect with people, and that’s also why he throws himself into work so much. I told him that if he didn’t get help, he would end up a very lonely old man. In that moment I felt pretty strong and proud of myself.So as you may have guessed, we broke up. Part of me for a while even thought about trying to save it and work at it, and now that I look back I can’t believe I was ever even thinking that. He kept saying “I just don’t know what to do for the best, should we break up or not?” But doing so was absolutely the right thing. I’ve since had many friends coming forward saying they didn’t trust him, something was off etc.Regarding the girl I talked about, his ex who he cheated on his other ex with- I could see on her brothers Instagram a video of my ex smirking at his phone and the caption was “he’s thinking about my sister ;)” to which he replied with another winky face so… what does that say. But I’m not looking Instagram at this stuff anymore. On the day we broke up he packed some bags and left, he told me to stay with a friend. It turns out that that friend was his exes brother, and he’s been living there for a month. I will be moving into a new place in 2 weeks and even though he has gone to stay with his friend he is still paying his share of the rent, he just swings by to pick up some stuff every now and then when I’m at work, I haven't actually seen him.For the past few months I’ve been feeling really low, with barely any energy. I’m picking myself back up again and though it’s a slow process, I’m coming back into myself. I’m determined that I’m not going to let anyone make me feel like that again.I’m not sure if I needed to write all of that and if you guys needed all of those details, but writing this was quite cathartic. I guess I would just say, to anyone who is reading this and my original post, who is in a relationship that they feel horrible in, just leave. It’s hard, but please leave. You will feel SO much better.Thanks again, Reddit.130 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
kcx4yw,6.7kPosted by10 months agoArchived28611913[1 Year UPDATE] My girlfriend (F 20) cheated on Me(M 21) with her bestfriend..
              
            UpdatesAn year ago I posted on his subreddit. [Link below]https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d78jqe/my_girlfriend_f_20_cheated_on_mem_21_with_her/So I wanted to provide an update and thank my fellow redditors. I took the advice and broke up and realised that the relationship was really sucking the life out of me and was the worst thing in my life at the moment. Since then I have met someone who understands me and cares for me, theres no drama (Well I once ate the last pizza slice and she got pretty angry but yeah thats the level of the drama). We support each other and she makes me a better human all around.Because of my ex i wasn't able to focus on my studies and the breakup combined with the Covid Pandemic gave me ample time for studying and I landed an internship at a big Bulge Bracket company and also Im working on a few personal projects that I love spending time on. The pandemic also gave me time to realise that I was with the wrong person and I love many others who love me be it my family, friends,etc. I feel really liberated.Today I was looking back at what used to be and I remembered that this subreddit for the trigger point for the change in my life. SO THANK YOU AND YOU ALL ARE AWESOME. Its because of you Ive gone from Crying nights to Happy days.Edit 1: Some edits based on comments.Edit 2: HOLY SMOKES! I didnt expect such a reaction. Thanks Guys.Edit 3: Such Wholesome Comments, Thanks Guys.TL;DR! - Took the advice of fellow redditors and broke up with my ex and spent probably the best year of my life.277 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
hzwqcy,6.2kPosted by1 year agoArchived22I (24m) don't want to come off as weird to my apparent guardian angel (40m)
              
            [new]UPDATE:Thank you so much for all of the advice, and kind words.  You guys are great!  I've been very hesitant to use reddit up until now but you guys have proven my skepticism wrong!  I've decided I most definitely should write a letter for sure explaining how much he has helped me, and how grateful I am.  I think it's probably best to avoid any strange verbiage like "father figure" or "guardian angel" just because I don't want to make myself uncomfortable more than anything.Also!  I think based on a lot of your suggestions it might make me feel good if I got him a gift. Early on in our friendship he and I connected on our mutual love for fishing.  He is an avid spin fisherman, and I love fly-fishing, and actually am very good at it.  He mentioned to me that he'd love to learn to fly fish one day but never has.  Would it be cool if I bought him a nice fly rod and reel, and just added a P.S. to the note that I'll gladly teach him how to fly fish some day?  Or would that be weird?  Let me know!Also also!  Anyone know any good psychiatrists?Thanks for all your feedback, observations, kind words, and advice everyone!!!ORIGINAL POST:Most of my life after high school has been me skipping from job to job, either because of my inability to perform the job, laziness, or just plain rudeness on my part.  This probably all has a lot to do with a lack of a good relationship with my father.  I have struggled, even in childhood, to find anything I'm passionate about.  Often when I try something new I will get really excited about it and then be done with it after a week or two.  This pattern has lead to severe depression, and terrible relationships in most parts of my life.  I have a few friends who are close and supportive, but they are so keenly aware of how untrustworthy I am, just because I change my mind about who I am, and what I believe so often.About a year and a half ago, I went to get my haircut at a barbershop near my house.  I had recently become miserable in my latest endeavor: teaching music.  I had never met the barber, and he had never met me, but he asked me a few questions, and I grudgingly answered.  He stopped cutting my hair, looked me in the eye and said.  "You just need to be a barber."  I laughed, and he reiterated, "No, I'm serious, there's a school right down the street.  You need to be a barber."Flash foward a year and a half.  I've graduated barber school, and I have a job cutting hair.  I've never been more excited or passionate about anything in my life (aside from getting married).  The process of getting to this point has been insanely difficult, but also extraordinarily fulfilling.  I've never felt this way.  It's like no matter how much life sucks, I always have comfort in knowing that I am on a road to becoming a better barber.  To put it simply: this is the first time I've stuck with ANYTHING for more than 8 months, and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface!During every step of the process of becoming a barber, this man has been like a guardian angel.  He not only directed me to the school, but somehow got my tuition rate lowered by speaking with the school owner without my knowledge.  He encouraged me every time I felt unsure or afraid, and let me stand next to him for hours on in at his shop and taught me everything I didn't get to learn at school.  Tricks of the trade, and his special secrets that he's learned over the years.  My wife (I know unbelievable that I'm married given my background right?) was ready to divorce me, and break up with me, but this man AND HIS WIFE counseled us, and helped us make it through the year of barber school.  As the icing on the cake, he secured a job for me, cutting right next to him, at his brothers barbershop.This is just a sampling of the pure graciousness this person has shown me.  Every time I'm around him, I want to express to him how thankful I am, and how I want to make him proud.  It's like he's the father I never had.  But for some reason, I'm afraid that he will be put off if I thank him?  I'm not sure what it is.  I feel like I owe this man everything that I care about.  If it weren't for him I'd be working in Macdonalds, single, and probably suicidal.  (no hate for McDonalds workers, it's just not for me).  I just want to show him that his grace has NOT been taken for granted.  I want to make him proud.  I know this is probably really lame for this sub, but... it's so hard for me to wrap my head around how to repay him, or thank him without coming off as weird.He has a son of his own, and I don't want to make him uncomfortable by making him feel like *I* look at him like a father figure?  I don't know if that's wrong or not.   Any advice is welcome.... please!TL;DRMy guardian angel helped (and is still helping me) get my shit together, and I'm an awkward man baby that feels like I have a new father and want to tell him I immensely appreciate him but don't know how to not seem weird about it?369 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
ne1neo,6.2kPosted by5 months ago21333[Update] I [29F] am unsure on how to put the moves on my husband [32M]
              
            UpdatesOriginal PostTl;dr of last post: Due to coming off some long term medication, I have a sex drive for the first time in about 10 years. Realized I have no idea how to hit on my husband or initiate in general.My last post didn't get a ton of attention, but I thought I would update people anyways. I took most everyone's advice and talked to my husband. He thought the whole situation was hilarious (in a nice way). But he was very reassuring. I told him about my fears of rejection, or doing something wrong. How my body issues have made it difficult to initiate because I fear I wont be able to turn him on. He gave me some ideas on how I might come on to him, what subtle moves might work to help initiate. He also reassured me that unless something major was going or he was sick, he would pretty much always reciprocate. He soothed my body fears and told me he finds me very attractive and I shouldn't worry about that.You guys, this has been life changing. Talking with my husband completely alleviated my fears. After a couple of false starts, I was able to start initiating. And its been going great. We're both all over each other all the time, just like we were highschoolers again. Maybe even better. Thank you so much everyone for convincing me to just talk to my husband.Tl;dr: Talked to my husband. Things worked out perfectly. It's like were 16 again.123 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
hqzk0u,6.1kPosted by1 year agoArchivedMy boyfriend's ex wrote a letter to me. I feel really strange and jealous even though it was a nice letter
              
            RelationshipsMy boyfriend (26) was in a relationship with a girl for 3 years from 20 to 23. She's from the other side of the world and missed her home to much so eventually she went back and that's why they broke up.Over the 9 months that I've been with my boyfriend he's told me a few things about her, all postive. From his friends I heard that they were THE dream couple and that she was a very kind and lovely person. Some said that they think he's never going to love again like he loved her which obviously hurt.Well today it got weird. Apparently when they broke up she gave him a letter. Amongst other things it says that she wishes him happiness blah blah. But then it says that he should give another letter to the girl he finds love with again. Apparently she enclosed that letter.He gave it to me unopened. I didn't know what to expect. But she was so nice in her letter. Basically said I'm very lucky to have his love that I should cherish it and that I must be a great person if he's chosen me. Then she included some anecdotal tips on how to make him happy.I just feel weird. This woman seems to be a saint. I don't know how to feel about this letter and the whole thing. Should I contact her? But what would I even say? Isn't it strange that my bf or anyone else hasn't mentioned a single negative thing about her? Somehow this letter made me jealous because I could feel a level of closeness that I don't have with my boyfriend. What should I make of this? ￼ Tldr. Bf gave me a letter his ex wrote to me.843 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
lq5de8,6.1kPosted by8 months agoArchived42UPDATE My best friend [22F] is giving up a full-ride scholarship to be with her boyfriend of >3 months
              
            Updateshttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7awaf0/my_best_friend_22f_is_giving_up_a_fullride/Just found this throwaway account and thought I should give an update! My friend and I are now 25, and we’re still close. She did transfer schools and lose her scholarship. She also graduated late because of the transfer. In all, it cost her more than $30k in student loans, which she regrets.Things did not work out between her and her boyfriend. He really wanted to live a party boy lifestyle with her at home to cook and clean up after him. They broke up one year after she transferred. She still had a semester left, which was really difficult and lonely because she had no friends aside from him and his social circle.After graduation, she got a job as a teacher in her hometown. So she does have a way to pay back the loans! She’s pretty happy. She’s now engaged to a different guy she started dating ~2 years ago. They got together right after she moved home. Yes, it’s fast, but they live together with no issues. They aren’t going to start planning a wedding until COVID eases up. She’s less gullible now and more skeptical of her mom’s advice. Her experience really opened her eyes to the consequences of her choices.TL;DR My friend learned an expensive lesson, but her life turned out okay. She ended up where she probably would have if she didn’t transfer, but $30k in a hole. She’ll be the first to tell you to prioritize your future over a short-term relationship!175 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
m3l3uh,6.1kPosted by7 months agoArchived2326UPDATE - My (27F) boyfriend (28M) is obsessed with my ex (27M).
              
            UpdatesOriginal postAfter my last post, I tried to take the advice in the comments and suggested couples counselling and I asked my boyfriend to cut off my ex, but he got angry at me again. He claimed I was the one who needed therapy because I had jealousy issues, and that my ex was one of his good buddies and I couldn’t dictate who he was friends with.Then a week later he had another hangout with my ex and his friends where he proceeded to very loudly tell them how I was so insecure, and I was trying to tell him who he could speak to. My ex and Luke had to tell him to stop which he didn’t like at all. I should’ve just broken up with him at this point, but I was stupid and still clinging to the hope of my boyfriend going back to how he was. After this happened, my boyfriend was constantly making jabs at my ex and Luke but then he would still contact them and pretend to be friends with them.Then, he became super interested in what my sex life was like with my ex. He was constantly asking me who was better between the two of them and he would ask me if I had done this or that with my ex. I kept telling him I didn’t want to talk about it and to stop asking me. I then find out from my ex and Luke that he had been asking my ex directly the same questions and that he had been bragging about our sex life to his friends. My ex said he was telling me because my boyfriend made a comment about loaning me to my ex if he ever felt like recreating old times. That was the final straw for me, and I broke up with him and moved out.My now ex-boyfriend didn’t take the breakup well and he went on a smear campaign. He even contacted my family and my ex’s family to tell them we were apparently having an affair and that he had no choice but to break up with me. It’s been almost a month since we broke up and he keeps getting new numbers to text and call me.Deep down I think I knew this would be how things ended. I’m sad about the relationship I thought we had ending but now that I’ve had space away from my ex-boyfriend, I feel much better and it's like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders.TL;DR – My boyfriend wasn’t willing to work on the relationship and he kept doing things to embarrass/upset me so I finally broke up with him.258 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
o4c6y1,6.3kPosted by4 months ago141121424Update to Nightmare Situation: Me(35F) with Partner(40M), my son and his nephew (15Ms)
              
            UpdatesOriginal post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nb1jcp/nightmare_situation_me35f_with_partner40m_my_son/Hi again everyone. I posted about my family problem about a month ago and was bowled over by the amount of kind and extremely helpful comments I got. Someone requested an update, so I'm posting now to tell you what's happened since. To be honest it's also to unburden myself, the boys are really sweet but I obviously can't talk to them about these things and there aren't a lot of people in my life I feel comfortable sharing all the details with. I suppose I'm embarrassed.The week after my original post, I met with a family lawyer I know to go over options. I actually wrote down the legal suggestions posted here to discuss with her, but unfortunately, after going over each and several others in detail, we had to conclude that for each one, while it might technically be feasible, it would either take too long to be practical, or require things from Bob or from Ben which for various reasons were not ideal. Following the meeting, I was mulling things over and decided to take a long hard look at our finances to see what might be affordable as a compromise, such as perhaps sending Ben to a GOOD boarding school and pay tuition up front, so that if I then left Bob it would be easier and cheaper for him to leave Ben there rather than move him to a different school.Anyway, I went over our financial records with a fine-toothed comb, and that's when I discovered Bob was cheating on me, and had been for the entirety of our relationship. It turns out that, prior to Ben's parents' death, Bob had been about to move in with another woman. This woman didn't want kids, so when Bob was suddenly faced with taking custody of Ben or seeing him placed in foster care, she made it clear she would not be involved (for the record I can't say I blame her - I love my boys with all my heart, but asking someone who never wanted kids to parent a bereaved 11 year old she has never met is not in anyone's best interests in my opinion). When I confronted him about the affair, he didn't even attempt to deny it. He seemed ashamed (good!!) and just asked what happened next, so I told him that next he was going to get his stuff and get out of my house, but first ask Ben if he wants to go or stay, because it wouldn't be fair to disrupt the poor kid's life any further. Ben quickly said he preferred to stay, and Bob seemed frankly relieved. He moved out that weekend and I haven't seen him since. We've been in touch by text to discuss financial arrangements, though, and last week he sent me money to cover Ben's basic expenses (nothing like as much as child support, but under the circumstances I'll take it and be glad). From his attitude I take it that he's seeing this as a longterm thing, but even he doesn't, according to the family lawyer, his leaving Ben with me even for a while, along with Ben's age and the fact that Bob is his guardian rather than his father, would make it easier to build a case for Ben to stay even if Bob does try to fight it. The lawyer is confident that such a battle could be won, or at least dragged out till Ben is 18 and it doesn't matter anymore. So that, as you can imagine, has been an enormous relief.That makes it that much harder to admit that finding out about Bob has still hit me hard. The fact is that, even though I was absolutely done with him and wanted him out, there was a time I truly believed he wanted to be with me and that we could build a life together. I knew our relationship wasn't a romance for the ages or anything like that, but it was by far the best I'd had since before my son was born and I really thought we cared for and valued one another. Now I realise that all he ever wanted from me was a mother for Ben. He as good as admitted it, and in retrospect it makes complete sense. That's why he never wanted to get married or buy into my house even though I offered (though now of course I am grateful!), because he wanted to make it as easy as possible to split from me once Ben was old enough to no longer require my services. I think it might even explain why he was so hard on Ben and grasping at straws for a reason to send him away. I never expected it of him based on what else I knew or I never would have been with him, but if he was blaming Ben for getting in the way of his life and simultaneously feeling guilty for, that could turn a mild-mannered person mean I think. Maybe he even thought if Ben was away most of the time the other woman would be willing to compromise for a few years? I don't know. I've even been wondering whether he decided to pursue me before we'd even met (the boys met first through an extracurricular where they became friends. It's possible that Jason mentioned my being single in passing, allowing Bob to identify me as potentially 'suitable' before we ever met).I'm sorry this is such a mopey post, I truly am grateful for the way things worked out, I think it's the best possible solution for everyone under the circumstances, and not one I could have achieved without Bob's 'help'. And the boys have been wonderful, they didn't know I was trying to get Bob out anyway so they've been treating me very gently (or as gently as you can expect teenage boys to be, anyway) and trying to pretend they aren't thrilled Bob is gone when I'm in the room. I'm glad of that, to be honest. I AM so grateful he's gone and Ben is still safe here with us, I just need a bit of time to really remember it, I think.TL;DR: It turns out Bob has been cheating on me most likely for the entire duration of our relationship. He's moved out and left Ben with me.177 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
lrcym1,5.9kPosted by8 months agoArchived246911(5 year update) Me [44 M] with my sister [50 F], 44 years duration, got a painful message from her regarding my professional behavior as a substitute k-12 teacher and don't know how to respond (long)
              
            UpdatesThe front page r/askreddit thread inspired me to follow up here. Here's my original post from five years ago.The discussion was really helpful, and at one point I had my therapist read that thread. Thanks to everyone who chimed in.Since that post, I have not been in contact with my sister, except for incidentally at a few family events, where we had minimal interaction. My other family is conflicted, but they seem to understand that neither of us wants to be in each others' lives any more, despite them wanting us both in theirs.I've worked on this issue specifically in therapy, which has helped me develop some insight into those messages. Next year I will be as old as my sister was when she wrote me those abusive messages (there were a few followup messages I didn't include in the original post.)I don't regret cutting her out. I do regret having had a toxic person for a sibling. Looking back I recognized that her over the top email was part of a few lifelong behavioral patterns. I realized that basically, despite our biological similarities and having been raised in the same household, we are simply not compatible people.I hope one day she will develop her own insight, recognize her abusive behavior patterns, and reach out to try to repair or reestablish a relationship with me. But I'm not holding my breath for this to happen, and I'm not interested in reaching out to ask her if she'll consider trying to improve things. Not having her in my life in the years since has actually improved the quality of my life: there's been a lot of unnecessary drama and hard feelings that I'd been used to having to handle that I simply don't with her gone.At this point I anticipate only seeing her at a few more funerals. Would have been nice to have a good relationship with a sibling, but I do not have that with her and I don't believe I ever will.tl;dr: Cut abusive person out and life has improvedEDIT: I am humbled by your responses. Your support has moved me to grateful tears. Your perspectives, today and years ago, have really helped me to power through a pretty difficult experience. Thank you very much.254 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
mouqno,5.9kPosted by6 months agoArchived2444UPDATE: My (24F) boyfriend (26M) has a long time female friend who's clearly into him and I don't know what I should do.
              
            Updateshttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mnltmh/my_24f_boyfriend_26m_has_a_long_time_female/After reading the comments I decided to just bring it up with him without telling him what I want him to do, to avoid sounding controlling.I sat him down and told him that some of the stuff that she says really makes me uncomfortable. I told him that I feel like she's undermining our relationship. I gave him a few examples of the stuff she said and done that I didn't appreciate. He still doesn't think she's into him. He's convinced that she's acting this way because she probably feels like they're drifting apart as friends because he's in a serious relationship now. Which frustrated me a little tbh because its clear to me that she wants him but being subtle about it.He said that regardless of her intentions, if her actions are making me uncomfortable. He'll have a talk with her about it. I was really happy he said that, because I was really nervous and anxious to see how he'll react. I was afraid he'll take her side.He can be a dummy sometimes so I was worried that he'd bring it up with her in the wrong way. Like saying "my girlfriend doesnt want us talking anymore" and stuff like that but he nailed it. He told her in a text "Dude, I noticed some of the stuff you've been saying in front of my girlfriend lately and I've been wanting to talk to you about it. It's mad disrespectful and uncomfortable. We're cool, but just stop that s**t". Naturally, she acted all innocent and confused. She was like "what? you know I'd never do anything that would upset you" "I think you're misunderstanding" and stuff like that. He doubled down on it though.I could tell he felt somewhat guilty telling her off like that and I don't know if he's convinced that she's trying to undermine our relationship or not, but I'm so glad that he had my back in this. I'm honestly kind of glad this whole thing happened. It gave me a better idea of what kind of man he really is. He even said he'll stop hanging out with her alone if it makes me feel uncomfortable. He was also, lowkey mad at me for waiting this long to tell him I was uncomfortable around her.Safe to say that the best possible outcome happened. He really put her in her place and ngl it made me feel real good. All I could think of was "I WON!!!" lmao. Thanks to everyone for encouraging me to tell him because even though I knew that's what I should have done I was still scared to do it for some reason. I even thought about potentially just avoiding her for good. Which sounds ridiculous now that I think about it, because I shouldn't have to hide from her. I guess I'm just not good at confrontations.Thanks for the helpful advice everyone.TLDR: I told my boyfriend that his friend's actions were making me uncomfortable because she's clearly into him and she's undermining our relationship. He let her know that she has to stop and totally had my back during the whole thing. All and all everything turned out pretty great. Thanks to everyone for the great advice.285 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
hrddje,5.6kPosted by1 year agoArchivedUPDATE: Boyfriend (27M) and his girl best friend on social media being excessive
              
            UpdatesIf you want to read the old post:Original PostI read all the replies and I got many messages for an update. I appreciate all the advice that everyone gave. I called the bird brain last night and basically went off on him. He had explained that they previously did have a past many years ago but they had reconnected after his last relationship but it was strictly platonic but THEN...He tells me that he has herpes? That's one thing. Then tells me that I should possibly get tested. The last time we were physically together was in May. I confronted him and asked him if he slept with someone and he admitted that he slept with one person (pretty sure there were more). He said it meant nothing and it was only physical and there was nothing emotional about it. I asked why he did it and he said it was more of a "last hurrah" before he moved but it was with someone totally random. I asked how you meet someone random and he hesitated and said Tinder.Hearing all of this I didn't know what to say and was in complete shock. He said he was sorry and it didn't mean anything. He said he understood if I wanted to break up but would still want to be friends because "I'm really important in his life". I obviously immediately broke up with him but it feels like a huge weight is off of my shoulders. I don't plan on being friends with him either since it shows that he’s trying to have me around in his life, more of a benefit to him. He's a piece of shit and I'm glad he has herpes :)Another UPDATE: There were things I needed to get off my chest for my own closure and so I sent him a message saying that I’m not comfortable being friends after everything that he’s done and he’s trying to keep me around and what not. He responded back with a few messages but the one I thought that was hilarious was when he said “I am upset about the whole situation and the prospect of losing you in my life. You are an amazing woman and it was a pleasure getting to know you. I wish you the best and hope down the line, we are able to reconcile.”I realized with his response, he never apologized for hurting me or about the situation itself and saying HE’S hurt? I’m glad I got out of it sooner then later. I removed him off all my socials as wellThank you everyone for the comments and support. I’ll make an appointment soon to get testedTLDR: The tool slept with someone else while we were still exclusively together and is a piece of shit201 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
jngvrf,5.6kPosted by11 months agoArchived232Update: My (28F) boyfriend (32M) told me a “white lie” for almost 3 years and I’m not sure if it’s a red flag
              
            BreakupsLink to original post:https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i4nbdc/my_28f_boyfriend_32m_told_me_a_white_lie_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfTl;dr: we broke up lolMy previous post got more attention than expected so I figured I’d update.Well, it’s over. As many of you suggested, I couldn’t possibly build my life around someone who lied so pathologically.I initially agreed to work on the relationship provided that my ex get therapy to work through why he felt compelled to lie about so many aspects of his “life”. I also requested that he come clean to his parents, my parents, and anyone else he lied to or embellished the truth to. He agreed to this and seemed genuinely interested in working on things and himself. I really wanted it to work out and was willing to accept that maybe he was just wildly insecure/had some attachment issues or something that caused him to act this way. I waited 4 months for the therapy and confessions to happen and they never did, not surprisingly.For those of you who were confused about how I didn’t know he did not own this apartment for so long/thought I had never met his parents - I had met them many, many times. But tbh they are pretty cold people who I never really connected with that much and was definitely not comfortable enough to be like “hey, is your son a pathological liar or is all of this true?”. On top of that, he also told a lot of these lies to his parents as well so they wouldn’t have been keen to what I was talking about anyway.It got to the point where basically anything that came out of his mouth seemed like a lie or at least a half-truth to me. Also, I lost respect for someone who could lie so easily and then not even feel guilty enough or any remorse to come clean about it. I’m pretty honest, almost to a fault. So the cognitive dissonance there that occurred from being with someone who had basically opposite values from me was tough.I’m sure there were a lot of other things he was hiding, but I don’t even care. I’ve been single and living alone for a week and to be frank I’m killin it. Im now responsible for 100% of my rent and I barely have any savings left, but I still feel like a giant weight has lifted off my shoulders. Crazy how that works.I want to thank all of the people who gave me the hard truth straight up and encouraged me to leave. Even though it was all coming from internet strangers, it still helps to hear people tell you that you deserve more than what you’re getting. I’m so happy and I must be giving off a much better vibe because I’ve already had 2 dates and been asked for my number a handful of times (I’m a server at a restaurant lol). I sound like a cocky asshole but god does it feel good to remember you’re not as worthless as someone made you feel.Thanks Reddit, and if any of you are in a relationship with someone who is like this - GTFO and don’t look back.128 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
nqhc9l,5.6kPosted by4 months ago3218Update: I (28M) messed up by asking my girlfriend (26F) to stop talking about her late boyfriend
              
            UpdatesOriginal PostAll the comments here helped me understand that we needed to talk about the issue but she was still a bit mad at me. I thought I should just give her space for a few days. I think a day or two after It was announced that I was being promoted. Some of  my colleagues hosted a little after work dinner for me as I would be moving divisions and not working with them anymore. It was nice and It really touched me and it also made me understand how fucked our relationship had become. I got what the comments meant but I guess actually having a nice dinner celebrating my success felt great and made me truly understand how unhappy I felt.we had the talk a few days later. I told her that I felt unhappy and unappreciated. That I felt like I needed some time away from her. She almost seemed like she was waiting for this. she didn't seem particularly upset over it. She said she understood and she would move back to her parents as soon as possible. I know it is ugly but some part of me wanted her to be upset. some proof that she cared for me? I don't know. I feel like she didn't love me at all. I feel like I wasted years being in love with her.She moved out two weeks ago and I miss her a lot. Home feels really lonely without her but at the same time I feel better. Not a lot but I feel a bit better about myself. It is strange.She is not a bad person. she is a wonderful person and that is why I fell in love with her but the closer we got the less happy our relationship made me. I know a lot of it was my fault and I need to work on communication skills.TL;DR : I realized how profoundly unhappy our relationship made me and broke up with her.244 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
lqdjmb,5.5kPosted by8 months agoArchived263UPDATE: I (24m) cannot stand my boyfriend’s roommate’s (26f) dog and I’m trying to understand why and get past it
              
            UpdatesHere is the original post.My first post didn’t get the most attention, but there was been a major recent event that made me think it was time to post an update.His roommate went away for the weekend (Valentine’s Day weekend!) and it fell on us to take care of the dog. I, obviously, was not too excited to be having to schedule my Valentine’s Day weekend around this dog’s needs, but was willing to do so to have a weekend alone with my boyfriend.Well, much to my surprise, the dog is a total sweetheart! When her owner is not around, she barely raises her voice, sleeps most of the day, and is extremely easy to care for! It would appear that it is really stuff like the incessant baby talking that actually bothers me, not the dog itself.Through observation, as well, I’ve realized that the dog only barks and whines because she knows she’ll get attention or food from her owner whenever she wants. My boyfriend has very cleverly trained the dog to know that that doesn’t work on anyone else. So no begging from us!So now I ignore the roommate’s dealings with the dog, love the dog herself, and let my boyfriend’s roommate deal with the worst parts of owning an old dog and just enjoy a buddy to watch tv with when shes not around.Win win! Thank you everyone for all the great advice.TL/DR: Dog doesn’t suck! Roommate still sucks at raising the dog but its much easier to ignore now because the dog is so great!122 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
i8jgfi,5.4kPosted by1 year agoArchived2[UPDATE] My [22F] former roommate [30M] is freaking me out, what should I do?
              
            UpdatesLink to previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8efmq2/my_22f_former_roommate_30m_is_freaking_me_out/No one asked for an update, but I thought I'd provide a short one.TL;DR: I never have to see John again in my entire life. David and I broke up. I moved away and cut off contact with everyone. Also, turns out I'm gay. Life is good now.Shortly after this post, David and I had a sit-down talk in which I said I was no longer comfortable going over to his place. I showed him this post and how he was getting roasted in the comments. He agreed and started coming over to my place more. However, this became more lax with time and laziness and he started asking me to come over to his house, which I hesitatingly did. Basically, it backslid into how things were before, and he made no real effort to change anything. At no point did David consider moving out, and as far as I know, they're still roommates.It's been a while now, so I honestly can't remember if John ever made an attempt at making an apology, but at any rate he never made an apology I deemed to be genuine and he always made me uneasy. No more serious incidents occurred. John never touched me physically. For this, I feel exceedingly fortunate.A few months after I made that post, I started wanting to move away for various reasons (mostly wanting a change of scenery and culture), and I realized that I didn't consider my relationship valuable enough to make me want to stay. That was over a year ago.We broke up, I moved away, and in quarantine I've reconsidered my sexuality and am now dating a lovely, thoughtful, and supportive woman. My life is much better now and I see that that I was allowing myself to be treated in a very horrible and toxic way. I also see that everyone in that house was -- in a way -- gaslighting me into thinking that John's abuse wasn't so bad in an effort to not "rock the boat". No one, at any point, made any effort to stand up for me, including my supposed romantic partner (which, honestly, now disgusts me). I'm not in touch with anyone from that circle anymore and honestly, good riddance. I'm so relieved that I never have to see any of them again.Anyway, despite being in lockdown and living in a deep, existential anxiety, I'm very happy and life is drama-free (aside from the fact that I still have to come out to my family, lol). Thanks everyone for pushing me in the right direction.EDIT: I was not expecting this to blow up in the way that it has. "David", I know you have a reddit account, and if you're seeing this, I hope you're doing well. "John" is hella toxic. Good luck with everything.EDIT 2: Seriously, this response is overwhelming. Thank you all so much for your support and well-wishes. I hope all of my future coming-outs go this well. <3156 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
o0buhm,5.5kPosted by4 months ago78Update : I (32F) snooped on my husband's (33M) phone and found out he is bi
              
            UpdatesOriginal postI did not expect so many responses and I was a bit confused on what to do but I guess most people in the community was telling me to give him space to process it himself and come out on his own terms.  I took the advice to be generally supportive of the lGBTQA community without being obvious about it. I also spend some time reading about bisexuality.I did post a story on June 1 but the best thing that happened was that his friend came out as bi herself. We follow each other on Instagram and she had made a post about it. I made a comment congratulating her and wishing her well. She did text me about a dinner and  while we werechatting she thanked me for my support and this wonderful woman gave me an another opportunity to express my support and do it in more personal way than a comment.He came out to me about a week ago. He was very nervous and still scared and all I wanted to do was tell me that I knew but from what I have read letting people do it on their own terms were really important. He told me, nothing would change. He just wanted me to know and he didn't want to hide a part of himself. It was okay. I told him nothing had to change. He was the perfect man for me and I loved him no matter what.He did ask me later if I knew and I came clean. I told him I saw. Apologized for it and cried a lot. He was upset but understanding. He even apologized for suddenly changing his behavior which is bullshit as I should have dealt with it a lot more maturely. it just hit just right spot of insecurity for me.Things are fine. He is happier and we are getting back to our old routines.TL;DR:  He came out. I confessed to snooping and things are okay.232 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
n21e9c,5.3kPosted by6 months ago4313I(17f) told dad about mom's affair to save him from a terrible marriage, now he wants a paternity test and I don't know what to do.
              
            Non-RomanticWhen I was about 9 years old, I realized my mom was having an affair for years on my military dad.  I did not say anything as I was really worried what would happen if I said anything. When I was about 12 years old, I found my dad looking at pictures of our family and tearing up and I couldn't take it and I told him about moms affair. Fastforward 5 years and I live full time with dad and his new wife and step sister and our lives have improved so much since leaving mom.Well grandpa on dad's side has been pressuring my dad to get a paternity test as he wants to make sure that "I am his grand daughter". This is getting really intense as grandpa may pass away soon and he says he doesn't know if he should leave us anything if he doesn't even know...Well my dad has resisted this for years and saying it doesn't matter. But now things have changed as I have half sibling on the way. I am totally happy and fine with this, but for some reason my dad has started to change his mind about the paternity dna test thing. He says he is worried that I won't receive help with my college or anything, but im worried he is wondering if he should care about me or just my new sibling.I am not sure how much money my grandpa has, but he does have a big house and a lot of property so I guess it's important. I would rather just continue with our relationship how it is... but I don't know what to do now and i haven't been able to sleep over this.What do you think I should do?TlDR: dad says we should get paternity test for me, but im worried he won't love me if it goes wrong.365 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
m4t5wl,5.2kPosted by7 months agoArchived481064UPDATE - My fiance (30f) and I (36m) are having serious issues after her sister interfered with my family's issues.
              
            UpdatesLink to original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ltq6pp/my_fiance_30f_and_i_36m_are_having_serious_issues/Well first off, I'd like to thank each and everyone that replied to my original post. A couple of the replies were a little harsh, but looking back that is exactly what I needed to hear.I broke up with my fiance almost 2 weeks ago, and when we sat down to talk, she was still adamant that what her sister did was the right thing and didn't care that it hurt my family.  She didn't apologize, showed no remorse or any sort of sign that she would be willing to work with me on this.  This left me with no choice but to break up with her.The first couple days were quiet, a lot of crying and sleeping in different rooms, no argueing or fighting. Then she went to stay at a friend's house 2 days later, and that is when things got bad. She would purposely come back to the house only when I wasn't there, and bring her sister with her.  Took a few more things from the house than we agreed upon, and her sister decided my couch was a great place to change a dirty diaper for her baby, including leaving a leaking dirty diaper on the couch for me to find.Then the next few days started a smear campaign on social media and lies told to friends.  Myself, Ive stayed quiet on the social media regarding the breakup and keeping my distance trying to let things cool down.   I have now blocked my now ex fiance on every platform, including emails as it was nothing but her trying to drag me into an arguement that would go no where.TL;DR  Fiance wouldn't talk it out, we broke up, she showed her true colors. I dodged a bullet.Thank you kind redditors that helped me see the light. I had a hunch that things weren't all that great, but I needed someone stranger's to tell me to pull my head out of my ass.EDIT- Thank you for the silver, awards, and kind words. After reading all these comments, I feel much better about everything. I appreciate it very much.225 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
msx4sa,5.2kPosted by6 months ago3354UPDATE: My Girlfriend wants to take a stressful job and I foolishly set an ultimatum against it
              
            UpdatesOriginal postI (27M) would like to thank everyone who took time to give me valuable advice, it helped me realize I was going about it the wrong way and possibly ruined a relationship of 7 years . Yesterday, we sat down and had a proper conversation. I apologized to her for lashing out with an ultimatum, I explained how scared I was of things sliding back. She (28F) was able to understand it and she also pointed out how hurtful me setting down and ultimatum was. I talked about mapping out a plan so that we don't slid into the mess we had created.I think me being open to the idea of her working allowed her to be vulnerable and reveal why she wanted to chase money. She wants to put down roots in the city and buy a house here. she grow up in pretty unstable circumstance and moved around a lot. She is adamant that we own a house before we get married/have kids and the home market here is booming. She also thought that it was a bit embarrassing to be so fixated on owning a house and wanted to take the whole burden on herself. I really love this woman. I know that her actions in the past has not been great but even after that I trust her to be kind.I think, this perspective is not something I could have ever thought of , I come from a more privileged background and even though my parents raised us to be independent but we always knew that if things got ugly, we had a safety net. She never had that and I understand her need to create one. After we stopped crying and talking. we went through the budget and talked about areas where we could cut expenses.She really doesn't want to change jobs, so we are planning on her asking for a raise and I think I will start looking for a new job. I am pretty indifferent about my workplace and I don't mind jumping ship to increase my salary. She is happy and would have disliked to move to another company.I have to really thank the people here for helping us talk this out. I am planning on bringing up counselling on a later date. we have a lingering issue on communication that we need to sort out.Tl;DR: we talked it out and I found out what she wanted and she was worried about money.

            RelationshipsI'm not sure how I ended up in this horrible place in my life but I guess it's because I believed what I wanted to believe rather than what was obviously right in front of me.I won't bore you with all the details but suffice to say he's 100% my type and I've always been gaga over him. When we met 7 years ago I had very limited sexual experience. He had plenty. Right from the beginning, he was very take-it-or-leave it towards sex. I asked him several times if he was attracted to me. He always said yes, but that he just was on medication that dampened desire / exhausted from work. We had very little sex and I was insecure and never initiated. I figured he'd had SO much experience that if he wanted sex he'd initiate.We were like best friends who had sex sometimes (like maybe every 6 weeks). This was not enough for me but I accepted it because I loved him so much and I was too shy to have a really frank discussion. Nor did I want to make him feel bad. I also was always there for him in every way (emotionally, practically, etc). He really grew to rely on me because he suffers from ADHD and depression and often needed my support in many ways (which I was happy to give).There were many hiccups. I caught him texting other women a few times. He watched porn a lot. I figured he was intimacy avoidant or something. But I truly loved him.We got married. Once we had a huge fight and during it our lack of sex came up. He was always suggesting it was my fault but I didn't think it was. He'd call me a prude but I honestly couldn't understand what he was talking about. He cited the fact that I never got on top. I always feel awkward on top and it doesn't feel good and he never told me he liked it so I didn't think it mattered. I brought up the fact that he always wanted oral but never once had returned the favour (still hasn't...not once). We were fighting and it was escalating and he told me "if you want to know why I've never given you oral it's because you disgust me sexually". I was hurt and shocked but he later told me he didn't mean that.We've had several more fights over the years and once he told me he loved me deeply but wasn't attracted to me. He took that back too and said he didn't mean it. But our sex life never improved at all.Recently he got angry at me and called me fat. Later I asked him why he called me that and he said he was sorry for being rude, but that I have to admit that I'm fat. I am overweight (BMI of 27) but so is he. I honestly didn't think he viewed me as "fat". We talked a lot and he said he loved me very much and I was perfect for him because he fell in love with me, but that no, my body type is not his type at all. He has always preferred petite athletic women.It just all hit me. Our sex life has always sucked not because of medication or depression, but because he never was very attracted to me at all. He was with me because I provided companionship and love and support and he grew to rely on me and love me. But he's never felt any passion towards me.He says it doesn't really matter because he truly loves me and he's willing to work on having a better sex life with me. He says when we grow old we'll be unattractive anyway and love is all that matters.I'm just hurt and freaked out because I've been living this lie thinking we both felt the same way about each other when we clearly do not.I'm wondering.....does it even really matter? Does "lust" matter? Does it matter if I'm not his physical ideal? Can we still have a happy marriage if we are both in love and committed to each other even if he apparently doesn't have any real sexual feelings towards me?I'm so confused and I'd hate to make a mistake and get divorced from someone I really love just because he doesn't find me hot. Can anyone help me view this more clearly?tldr: husband has never been "into" me and I'm unsure if I should continue the marriage.741 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
j9skka,5.0kPosted by1 year agoArchived2313UPDATE - Boyfriend has stopped being romantic completely
              
            UpdatesHere's the link to my original post here : OriginalBut the TL:DR : Boyfriend (18M) has completely stopped flirting with me(18F) and I'm not sure if I'm being needy while he's at school and how I should approach him about the issue.I just want to say thank you to the original people who commented and reached out to me, I was very emotional at the time and needed some sense talked into me.That day I made the post, I was supposed to hang out with my friend and her friends, so I had sat down with them and asked for advice. They basically said the same thing everyone here did and I guess seeing their in-person reaction to me explaining everything that had happened made it click that something was really wrong. After getting over my fears of me being right, I asked him if he still wanted to be with me. While he didn't say no, he said he enjoyed his newfound independence from school and not having to worry about anyone else. This confirmed what I already knew and I knew he wouldn't directly say he didn't want to be with me anymore, but I still got my answer in a way. While I'm hurt, I think I had already grieved the relationship during it, since I spent a lot of time crying and wondering what had happened between us. At least now I can move on instead of holding onto every small sign that he might still like me.I wish he could have just been up front sooner, and just told me he didn't want a relationship when I kept trying to flirt or be romantic instead of just ignoring those moments, as it just left me confused, and I wish I could have avoided this completely but I suppose it's a lesson learned. I deserve someone who's going to reciprocate my feelings and affection, so I'm excited to see what happens now. Thank you guys for the kind words and advice.156 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
jcwxd4,4.9kPosted by1 year agoArchived4229I (f32) kind of want my boyfriend (m35) to be my dad
              
            Personal issuesJust the title sounds creepy... Me and my bf have been together for only six months but have been friends for about a year longer than that. We only ever hung out with a friend group and did dnd together and stuff, and I fell in love with him without really hanging out at his house or interacting with his kids. I knew he HAD kids (m7, f12), and he'd talk about them, but I didn't meet them until I was already in love with him.Some background: I came from an abusive household. Both of my parents were emotionally/psychologically abusive and my father was an angry drunk who threw things and punched walls. I've been in therapy for it throughout my life (when I can afford a therapist, yay USA) but am currently not.I've never really hung out around a healthy family with kids in it? I'm estranged from my extended family since cutting off my parents, and most of my friends either don't have kids or they're very small babies. The first time I went over to my boyfriend's house, his kid was acting up and I felt my whole body go tight waiting for him to get angry/aggressive with the child... and he didn't. He was kind and gentle. I was absolutely just... I'd never seen that.The more we spend time together and the more I see him around his two kids... I keep having these sort of earth-shaking revelations like... This is what parents are supposed to do. This is what it's supposed to look like. My therapists had explained, verbally, what it's supposed to be like, but that's very different from actually SEEING a parent who genuinely loves his kids and treats them well. I love spending time over there because when he is kind and gentle to his kids, I like... passively absorb it, is the only way I can think to explain it. I feel safe and warm and protected in an extremely just, primal way? That I never felt in my own house or anything.To be clear, I know what daddy kink/DDLG is... and this isn't it. It's not sexual at all. I just see the way he takes care of his kids and wish that I could just ... duck under that umbrella and be cared for like that too? One time he was telling me about the custody battle he went through with his ex-wife, who didn't want him around the kids, and how hard he fought to stay in their life and I just started crying. He was comforting and I tried to explain that no adult in my life would have ever fought for me like that. I told him "I wish I'd had a dad like you" and he said "I wish you did too." Which was very sweet but I just worry this isn't something I'm supposed to want from my boyfriend, or feel for him...? He knows about my parents and we've talked about it a few times. He gets it because he didn't have a great upbringing either.It's probably not okay to cross wires like that... I believe in communication in relationships so I probably need to talk to him about it. But how do I tell him so it doesn't come off creepy? There's just so much positivity and warmth and unconditional love in his house and I want to just... wrap up in it like a warm blanket. But it's not mine... it's his kids'. And I probably shouldn't get the wires crossed like that? I don't know. If I hadn't had to change jobs during covid I'd talk to a therapist again but financially that's just not an option right now.TL;DR - Raised in an abusive household, now see how my amazing boyfriend loves his kids and I wish he'd take care of me/love me the same way, since nobody ever did. Is that wrong? Do I talk to him about it?EDIT: Wow so many comments. Thank you all for your kind words and advice. I'm definitely googling a lot of the ideas and books and things everyone mentioned. I didn't expect so many people to relate to this. It's kind of sad and really.. heartwarming? I was worried I was messed up and that I should shove these feelings away and felt guilty for feeling like that, but a lot of you suggested it's just love. Healthy love, and it's okay to want that. Which feels like it should probably be obvious. I've decided not to make a big deal out of it or have any kind of Talk about it, but just keep telling him how much I appreciate him and the things I see in him. Thank you all again for so many comments and advice and ideas!277 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
lu2z2g,4.9kPosted by8 months agoArchived3UPDATE: My coworker [45M] often interjects his opinion on my [27F] soon-to-be wedding.
              
            UpdatesOriginal PostHello, thank you all for the comments!! I know it's been almost 2 weeks since my last post. Some of y'all offered some great advice...again, thank you. So here's what happened since my last post.I went back to work the next day and Jack was off...it was blissful. I didn't see him the rest of the week because he went back to Montana to see some family. I only knew his whereabouts because another coworker felt the need to inform me...Anywho, Jack gets back that weekend and on Monday he runs into me as we clock in. Immediately he begins to describe Montana...his sister was getting married in a small wedding...the colors...the flowers. I express my congratulations to his sister and start heading to my department. We don't see each other until lunch break.I'm sitting down enjoying my leftovers when Jack comes over and starts in on what he has in mind for my wedding, even so far as mentioning price brackets. I put up my hand and tell him to stop. I tell him that my fiancé and I are doing a courthouse wedding, it may not be romantic in his eyes, but it's what we want to do and what we are looking forward to doing. I also told him that he needs to drop the subject as we are not changing our minds.He starts apologizing and saying that he didn't realize that I was serious about the courthouse. I just shook my head and told Jack again to stop talking about it before I walked away from him.Yesterday I heard from another coworker that Jack was upset and didn't mean to cross lines with me. At this point I don't care. I said my piece and am super happy that I stood my ground. I will keep doing this too because it feels good to not be a doormat. I should've done this sooner! Thank you again.tl;dr: Jack went on vacation, came back, and started his usual spiel. I stood my ground and it felt pretty damn good.141 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
mh6y0w,4.4kPosted by7 months agoArchived3555[UPDATE] My Best Friend Is In Love With My Boyfriend
              
            UpdatesThe original post I know the original post didn’t get much publicity but I wanted to do an update in case any of y’all were curious. Thank you for the support and I took a lot of your guy’s advice I’m very grateful.So my (m22) and my boyfriend (m22) did get a call from Harry (m22) apologizing to us. He specifically called me but requested my boyfriend (WHO SIDENOTE IS NOW MY FIANCÉ SO I AM A VERY HAPPY MAN anyways :)) ) also be at the phone with me.So Harry when on this speech about how he knows he was in the wrong and that he wants to repair a friendship with both of us. This was about two days after I made the original post. And suddenly he claimed he no longer had feelings for my fiancé. Yeah right. Of course neither of us believed him and honestly his apology was kind of shit.I realized through the comments that he wasn’t a true friend and through more self evaluation that for awhile he was using me to get close to my fiancé. That realization hurt a lot and it definitely set back my development of getting over my social anxiety.I told Harry I didn’t want to repair are friendship. That I Had realized he was using me. And that he definitely wasn’t over my fiancé just after two days. When he claimed to be in love with him for over a year. I told him how he blatantly tried to take away the love of my life and how much that deeply hurt me.Harry didn’t take this well and exploded. He started cussing me out. Saying how he honestly could care less about my feelings.  How I was never a very good friend. How I have a tendency to push people away (again that’s why it hurt so much losing him and feeling betrayed because I already have a difficult time keeping friends in the first place cause it’s hard not to push people away) He told me he only stayed my friend for the past few months to try to get in my fiancé’s pants. Accused my fiancé of seducing him (honestly hilarious because my fiancé has a hard time flirting with ME because he gets so shy. Adorable though) he also claimed that I cheated on my fiancé with his ex boyfriend (definitely not true) at that point he was just trying to convince my fiancé to break up with me again over the phone. I hung up and blocked him after giving him a few harsh words.So it’s been a few days since then. My fiancé and I joined a book club as one of the commenters suggested since he and I both take interest in books. And things are looking up. He introduced me to some people he knew that I shared a major with and it’s nice to have people that like what I like. And I’m starting to put myself out there more with the help of my fiancé.And i proposed clearly. The whole thing kind of made me realize how much I loved him and I was already planning on proposing anyways. We had gone to a place that was special to us from when we were teenagers and we hadn’t been in about four years. So I proposed there. And he said yes. And now I’m very happy and could honestly care less about Harry.Thanks to everyone who commented :) much love.TLDR: Harry called to apologize and I told him I accept. His facade disappeared snd he cussed me out. He never wanted to be my friend. Just wanted my boyfriend who I’m now engaged to. Things are looking up and I feel overall happier.115 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
let91g,4.4kPosted by8 months agoArchived2527UPDATE: M27 boyfriend won’t talk about the future with me (27F)
              
            UpdatesHi guys, I just wanted to thank you all for your love, advice, and support regarding my last post. I woke up yesterday morning and told my boyfriend that either we’re going to have a serious adult conversation about the future right now, or you can pick a time later today. After a bit of back and forth, he picked 5pm. At 5, we sat down on the couch and discussed each of our goals regarding marriage, children, employment, etc. We also discussed concerns that each of us had, I started out with mine and then I think that helped him voice his concerns, the largest of which involved my family (they are complicated). I think me forcing the scheduling of a time to talk helped him open up about his concerns. No, I don’t have a ring on my finger yet, but my goal was to get him to open up about why he didn’t want to discuss it. We ended up talking for about 2 hours and I made clear my timeline requirements and he agreed. I feel like we’re in a good place now. Thanks again for all the love and support ❤️TL;DR finally got my boyfriend to talk to me about the future and I feel good about it.Original Post HereEDIT: For everyone saying that this doesn’t change anything and I should have broken up with him, and giving an ultimatum is going to backfire, etc. I didn’t give him an ultimatum. I never threatened to break up with him. I told him what I needed from him and we talked through a lot of questions and concerns(from both sides). It wasn’t a one-way conversation like you all seem to have assumed. Thank you to everyone for your continued support! I hope those of you who feel like relationship issues can never be resolved find happiness in your own lives ❤️EDIT #2: For everyone saying that my "timeline requirements" sound controlling, you must not be women who want to have children. Sorry, but I'd like to have kids and unfortunately my clock is ticking; I think wanting to be married by the time I'm 30 is pretty reasonable. For everyone saying he's just telling me what I want to hear and will keep pushing me off, I understand your concern, but the conversation we had leads me to believe otherwise. I know that sounds fishy, but without relaying word for word what was said, I don't really know to explain it. Again, thank you all for your comments! You're really helping me think through everything from every angle.203 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted

            UpdatesOriginal post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/it2bwy/my_32m_best_friend_34m_helped_a_woman_24f_cheat/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareUpdate: So I know not many people read the original post but I figured I'd give an update anyway. After trying to talk to my friend through October and the beginning of November I finally threw in the towel when he started being a dick on the 1st anniversary of my father's death. I kicked him out of my place and have had zero contact since. While it hurt to cut off a friendship that had lasted as long as ours did ultimately I think it's for the best. It's been 26 days since my last drink and I'm feeling more confident every day. I've discovered other friends that have been quietly supporting me and realized they were better friends than my now former roommate.Tl;dr: Kicked my former best friend out of my condo and out of my life. Found life to be slowly improving due to that decision49 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
hpkndz,4.3kPosted by1 year agoArchivedUPDATE: My [24F] boyfriend [25M] is being passive aggressive about my injury since it happened when I was drinking and is also accusing me of "overplaying" my injury
              
            Updatesoriginal post hereSo first off, I appreciate everyone's advice. I broke up with my boyfriend! I just couldn't get past him not taking my injury and pain seriously and basically blaming me for it. It was really hurtful that I was in pain and he didn't seem to care at all. It was a relatively smooth breakup. There was no arguing or anything. I told him how I felt and all he said was "sorry" but it wasn't a sincere apology. It was more of a "sorry you feel that way."So I'm moving out. I'm in the process of beginning to move all my stuff out which I think is the worst part. It's especially not fun on a broken foot! My aunt and uncle live about 40 minutes away and they are more than happy to let me stay with them while I look for a place.Again, I really appreciate everyone's advice. I'm happy with the outcome and think it was for the best. If he couldn't take me seriously now, I don't think i could ever trust him to take me seriously or be supportive in a medical situation again.TL;DR: Broke up with my boyfriend today after he didn't take my injury seriously. I am moving out and feel good about my decision.155 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
l9jhzy,4.3kPosted by8 months agoArchived6364UPDATE: When I 34f told boyfriend 36m I frequently feel judged/scrutinized by him he told me there are “millions of things” he doesn’t say. Do I need to change my perspective or are we incompatible?
              
            UpdatesOriginal Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/go2t88/when_i_34f_told_boyfriend_36m_i_frequently_feel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfFirst, thank you to everyone who responded to my original post. I remember exactly how confused and mentally exhausted I was at that point. Reading the responses and having my feelings validated by a bunch of internet strangers gave me the confidence to know I wasn’t being too sensitive (f that). It also got me out of a constant state of rumination about what was happening to me and why I felt so off and not myself and led me to act.I told him I wanted space and that if we were both trying our best and our relationship felt like this we had a huge problem. I also told him that at some point he had stopped treating me like his girlfriend and started treating me like a defective human being and I was over it and wouldn’t continue to invest my time and energy into someone who treated me this way.Those first few days I spent alone were like an f-ing vacation. I couldn’t believe how amazing it felt to do simple, every day things without his constant interference and judgement. At the same time,  I did start to notice some of the things I was blaming him for being critical of me were really areas I was insecure and being critical of myself. I spent more time over the next few months investing in myself and and improving certain areas of my life.Our relationship seemed to improve slightly over the next few months. The micromanaging and criticism really improved or I thought they improved. He might have just changed tactics. I think he started triangulating and upping the ante with the “innocent” insults. I think I had also gotten better at dealing with it and probably lowered the bar even more.In the fall I had my first ever sciatica flare up. It was agonizing pain almost constantly. It lasted 8 weeks and I was trying everything - physical therapy, anti inflammatories, bio freeze, ice, not moving, powering through the pain. He was over it all after a few weeks and starting treating me like I was a lazy slob. I felt so scared and helpless about how much pain I was in and if It was ever going to get better or would I need surgery. The added stress of still trying to be a good partner was horrible.I’m not sure why this instance of his selfishness had more impact, but I felt something change inside of me in a profound way. Of course when I tried to talk to him about it, it went very poorly. The argument ended when he mocked me for crying and asked me why I couldn’t talk to him like a normal person .I can’t remember when it started but I began to have physical responses during any kind of conflict with him. Sort of like fight or flight maybe? My hands start shaking, I start feeling overwhelmed and confused, my stomach is flipping, and eventually the tears come.This comment from my original post rings true:“It seriously sounds like a low key gateway to emotional abuse. I can't imagine his BS only starts and stops at just hacking away at OPs self worth and then gaslighting her about what's happening.Those people get worse as the relationship goes on, not better.”The BS certainly didn’t stop there. There were so many instances during our relationship where I felt he had lied to me. There were constant interactions where my instincts told me he was being inauthentic or he was hiding something or not giving me all the details. The addictions. The attention he gave women on social media. Always needing someone to blame. An almost embarrassing inability to take accountability.I still feel pretty conflicted about what I did. I went through his phone. I started by looking for a couple specific times in the beginning of our relationship where my mind had flagged something as off or a lie but I had no idea why. Like when he insisted we go drop a bottle of champagne off to a friend of his as a congratulations for getting a new job. At the time I couldn’t place what felt off about this. I looked at texts from this specific date and now I know that we were really there to deliver cocaine. When I was able to confirm what my instincts told me were lies it was off to the races.It was all pretty bad. He was on tinder for the first 6 months we were together, bumble for 9, and plenty of fish 11. All texts with other women deleted. Secret drug use. It’s hard to even remember everything but I tried to just confirm what I had felt to be lies.There is definitely a ton of anger and sadness but more than anything else I felt relief. Everything my instincts have been telling me since the beginning have been accurate and I have been fighting a losing battle against them. It felt freeing.Why have I continued this relationship in spite my instincts for 2.5 years and endless stress and chaos? My hair has been thinning since the 3 month mark in our relationship. I’ve had brain fog and memory problems despite being known for my iron trap memory. Sleeping issues. Weight fluctuations. My body has been physically rejecting this relationship. Somehow I either couldn’t admit that it was him or I was really that out of it. I’m starting to try and unwind it all in therapy.  I have had 3 sessions so far and am scheduled weekly for the foreseeable future. What I have learned so far is I was taught to not trust my feelings as a child by my Dad, who is very likely a narcissist. I’m really excited to work on my toxic patterns and behaviors in therapy and make the relationship I have with myself better and my priority.We have been living in separate bedrooms for a couple weeks. The initial confrontation was horrible and I hurled some really rough insults and names at him. A few weeks ago I was thinking that I would have a final discussion about why we were breaking up and the logistics of him moving out etc. It still almost felt like I was going to have to convince him that this was a good enough reason to break up.After a deadline for work is over in the next couple days I’m going to tell him the relationship is over because I want it to be. And I do. I’m going to offer to pay for movers so I have an exact date he will be gone. I am nervous about his reaction and scared of what he might say to hurt me but I have never been more certain I’m making the right decision  so I know I’ll be able to handle whatever happens.Again, thank you endlessly to anyone who took the time to comment on my original post or reached out. I felt seen and heard that day in a way that woke me up and nudged me to really start paying attention and stop turning everything inward.TL;DR I wasn’t being too sensitive; we are incompatible. He was not only making my life a living hell with all the criticism, gaslighting, and passive aggressive jabs, he was also a liar and a cheater. Coming to terms with all of it and working on myself in therapy.Oh and one more thing - In my original post I played dumb about what he was insinuating when commenting about the shorts with the wet waistband. I was so paranoid at that time I wanted to see if other people came to the same conclusion that I had. When I reread my post that stuck out to me as sad.183 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
n7yj49,4.1kPosted by5 months ago25I (25f) feel upset with what my husband (26m) gave me for Mother’s Day
              
            RelationshipsTomorrow will be my 2nd Mother’s Day. Normally my husband doesn’t care for holidays unless he’s getting something. So on birthdays, Valentine’s Day, etc. he goes out the day of and gets me the first thing he sees (last year he got me 2 redbulls and a card from the display in front of Walmart and didn’t even sign it, and I still had to cook, clean, and watch our baby while he played video games). Today he sent me to get his mom and grandma giftcards to a chocolate place, and then said to just get chocolate for myself too and I feel annoyed. Not with getting money for a gift, but because it was a gift to brush me off so I couldn’t say he didn’t get me anything, and the gift is also attached to a chore.He just had 3 days off in a row and spent every day gone from noon-4am with friends. He had time to pick out gifts but just didn’t feel like it. So now, not only do I have to drive 40 mins away to pick up last min gifts for his family while I’m up to my eyeballs in tests, I feel like an afterthought especially since after 3 years married he should know I don’t eat chocolate so telling me to pick out some is irritating.Idc if my gift is cheap or homemade, I just hate lazy and thoughtless gifts. It makes me feel unappreciated and like I’m not worth any time or effort. He could have literally just offered to watch our son so I could relax and I would have loved it, but since he’s satisfied gift “requirements” he’s already made plans to spend tomorrow at a car meet with his friends. Am I just being ungrateful and overreacting?TLDR: my husband sent me money to buy myself candy I don’t even eat for Mother’s Day as an afterthought because he was already sending me to get it for his mom and grandma689 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
n9c90l,4.1kPosted by5 months ago57912UPDATE: I (17m) cannot get my parents (45m, 44f) to listen to me regarding my sister's (6f) educational needs
              
            UpdatesOriginal post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n5hlsh/i_17m_cannot_get_my_parents_45m_44f_to_listen_to/Hi everyone! About 98% of you were super wonderful on my last post and seemed genuinely invested so I thought I'd give you all an update.It's been just under a week now and after trying some of the different tactics and talking points you suggested, in addition to reaching out to the deaf/HOH community, my parents and I have come to a compromise, if only to shut me up. But I'm not the one that's important here, that would be Ana (6f).So, come the new school year Ana will be going to the school my parents chose BUT we (including me!) will be keeping in close contact with her teachers, specialists, etc, her progress and talking to Ana herself about how she feels. If it seems like it isn't a great fit, we will be transferring her to the deaf school. It's a little out of the area, but I think we can make it work.I did open up to my parents a bit - as much as they could handle - and told them that I feel like I've been, not robbed but had a stunted childhood and that my academic abilities forced me to grow up quickly. That, coupled with their emotional distance and lack of physical presence with Ana, made me angry and frustrated that my opinions on her future weren't being taken into account.I wish I could say that was what did it, but honestly my points about the school not teaching Ana independence and other arguments brought up on the original post probably eased them over to my side a bit (I kept my temper even this time).I mentioned in my edit on the last post that I'd gotten in contact with a Deaf Advocacy group and they've provided some wonderful resources so hopefully sometime soon Ana will FINALLY be able to meet kids and adults like her! (She's SUPER excited by this. She's the least reserved and most outgoing sibling out of us three so I've no doubt she'll make friends quickly.)I've also made the decision to start seeing a therapist to maybe work on some of the issues that I've been reflecting on and to get some emotional support where my mom and dad drop the ball. I don't see them changing or even admitting they need to change anytime soon. But that doesn't mean I have to stay complacent.That's...more or less the main chunk of what I wanted to say. I notice the rules say we aren't allowed to upload images so I'll just describe the drawing Ana just gave me to pin up on my office wall (she's a brilliant little artist, I'm not even biased).An ocean surface. A large boat approaches from the left hand side, full of garbage. A great blue whale stands, mid-breech, opposing, brandishing a gun in one flipper. A speech bubble from the whale reads 'NO!' while the ambiguously-gendered humans on the Garbage Boat scream in terror, presumably ready to flee.(Her kindergarten assignment was to come up with a way we can protect our oceans from pollution and personally, I think she's hit the nail on the head.)Thank you so much to everyone for your thoughts and feedback!TL;DR: my parents and I came to a compromise on my deaf sister's elementary school, I am working through my issues, Ana is getting to know her community and she drew an awesome picture today.146 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
nmhloz,4.0kPosted by5 months ago23710UPDATE: I don’t know what to expect for my [23F] date with my best friend [23M] and I don’t feel ready for it
              
            UpdatesLink to original post:My head is still spinning from our date last night. I was so nervous that I felt sick and I literally almost canceled last minute, but I'm so happy that I went through with it! I told him beforehand that I had anxiety about not knowing where he was taking me and I didn't know what to wear. He still wouldn't give away the surprise but he did tell me to dress comfortably, so I just wore one of my nice casual dresses. He made us an outdoor drive-in movie theatre (don't ask me how he did it because I'm hopeless with technology) where we watched my favorite movie and he brought popcorn and my favorite chocolate! Afterwards he took me to this new bookstore cafe in our town which had just opened and I had been dying to go to. I was so happy when he finally kissed me even though I had been previously dreading that he would. We actually kissed quite a bit. I found that my heart was beating not from nerves this time, but from genuine excitement. Now I look forward to intimacy with him and I feel like it'll just make us even closer. It's still unbelievable to me that this is happening, but it doesn't scare me anymore.I never thought Connor would ever make me feel like this. In my head it just wasn't a possibility since we were such good friends. I couldn't be happier that I decided to give him a chance instead of just immediately shutting it down in fear of ruining the friendship. In reality, our friendship was never in any danger. Yes, there are real differences between dating and just being best friends but there are WAY more similarities than I was expecting. The conversation still flowed the same way it did when we were only friends and we still have plenty of fun and laughs. I'm overjoyed that our friendship dynamic hasn't changed because I was mainly worried that things would be awkward now and I wouldn't know how to behave around him. Now it feels like we're friends who just happen to be dating and IMO that's exactly how things should be. Seeing how happy he is just feels like the cherry on top.TL;DR: I was terrified to date my best friend. I ended up being pleasantly surprised and I had fun on the date. Thank you so much to everyone who calmed me down and told me to be honest with him about my anxiety beforehand because your advice really helped!141 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted

So i'm 23 yo now, and a lot has changed, after my last post, i spent the next 2 years doing nothing because i was broken.I went back to study something i loved this year and got my diploma (BTS in France if you care, it's not much but it's alright.), and i'm now gonna push for more since i loved this year very much.My ex-girlfriend ended up dating someone else richer and more handsome than me, but whatever. We're still friends tho, being the only woman on earth who has ever made me laugh. I did not date anyone else since, most women i thought i had a good feeling with did not find me attractive so i didn't push.Well all in all, it's alright, i got my driver license too, your past comments ended up being useful for me in a way, even if i acted 2 years later.Sorry for the typos i'm not fluent enough in english.Tldr: I'm doing better career-wise.Edit : I'm reading all your messages you are all very kind, I chose to respond to your comments with my main account "Limanys" because I don't care if my friends see my posts now.

jet6a7,4.0kPosted by1 year agoArchived32Update: My (34M) GF (26F) of 6 months won't talk to me over an incident that happened 2 weeks ago.
              
            UpdatesTL:DR GF wouldn't talk to me after some unfortunate events that happened that resulted in her officially breaking up with me this past weekend (OCT 17)Here is the original post. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j9z5di/my_34m_gf_26f_of_6_months_wont_talk_to_me_over_an/No one asked for the update, but I would like to say some things.Well, I was finally able to see her over the weekend for my and someone else's bday celebration, it wasn't a formal bday party, just hanging a friend's house during the day and going out later on. She basically ignored me at the friend's house and when I tried to get a minute to talk to her about what was going on, she wouldn't spare a few minutes to let me say my peace. But she did tell me she was pretty much done after the initial birthday incident a few weeks ago even though she kept telling me she didn't know how she felt or what she wanted yet. It's been a few days and the rose colored glasses are beginning to come off. I still think about her and want to be with her but it's getting better by the day. I've also started to try to remember certain things that bugged me about her in an attempt to help me move on because I've always had an issue with only remembering the good. Thank you all for you insights and advice, it helped me come to terms with the fact that she overreacted and wanted out anyway and this was just a good enough reason.Edit:  Wow! So many people have wished me luck and brought up some thoughts I've had as well. Thank you all so much for your insights and ideas.  Anytime I find myself thinking about/missing her, I will come back and read these comments to push me through.  Oh yeah, and thank you for the awards as well!Edit #2:  Somebody asked in the comments what hobby she was trying to get into.  I play tennis recreationally and I'm not sure if she was trying to get better at it for me, but she mentioned it several times that she would like for us to go and play together.  She even got one of our friends who also plays tennis, to take her out and show her some drills she could use to help improve her game.  She texted me last night saying she had some things to say and clearly I do so could we call and talk sometime, I said sure just let me know.392 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted

So cheers for all the advice and all that stuff.I spoke to my mum's and told them I was thinking about not skateboarding again. They told me that's good because they're not letting me. There were a few suggestions that I ask them to come watch me. When I floated the idea, it was shot down immediately.  I went to my doctor and she told me that she doesn't want me skateboarding again. She expanded on my condition after the accident to me and told me another fall like that isn't going to go well for me. She said even after I get this thing off, I'm going to need to go to therapy to build strength again.My mum gave my board to charity after we talked about it. I know they sound kinda mean, but they're really good mums. They're just very annoyed I did something very stupid. My girlfriend is annoyed me with me as well when she heard I heard I wanted to skate again. So overall I'm not skating anymore.TL;DR: I'm not skating anymore.131 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
kyqjar,3.8kPosted by9 months agoArchived2My (F47) husband (M48) finally wants to try counseling now that our youngest will be leaving for college and I am planning to leave. Should I agree to counseling?
              
            RelationshipsThis is a throw away for anonymity. For 25 years I have been in a marriage that has always been rocky. 12 plus years ago I was going to leave, told my family etc. Only to believe him when he said he would try. Of course things were better for a while...at some point I decided to stick it out until my kids were grown because I was afraid that having them in a visitation arrangement would be mentally damaging to them. That's his big issue, he is verbally abusive and controlling. I'm an independent, successful person and I am also  financially independent. I  have been able to keep him "in check" so to speak in regard to the kids most of the time because I simply won't tolerate his attempts to control them. That's not to say he has not habitually made our oldest feel less than or like he is a disappointment. Both of our kids are well adjusted, bright, motivated and loving. But, if they don't measure up in some way, his reaction is unbelievably harsh. He says hurtful things to the kids and they have both, at times, broken down crying about his treatment of them. All he cares about is "his money" and doesn't even want to help our kids with college. There's more, I could go on but, the question is, do I try counseling? My concern is that it's just a ploy to pull me back in. I begged him for years to go and he refused.Tl;dr My (F47) husband (M48) finally wants to try counseling now that our youngest will be leaving for college and I am planning to leave.759 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
ktz21o,3.8kPosted by9 months agoArchived8My mom texts my friends and girlfriend constantly.
              
            Personal issuesMy (21m) mom (61F) keeps texting my friends and girlfriend. It’s always been annoying and overbearing but it’s crossed a line. She almost texts some of my friends more than I do. She has never met most of them nor my girlfriend.I met my gf around a year ago. My mom asked for her number (for “emergencies”, but I knew what would happen). I said no as she and I weren’t dating yet and had really only been talking for 3 or so weeks. My mom proceeded to check my recent followers on Instagram and ask around among them to figure out who she was. Once she figured it out she began texting her. I don’t want this. She has also continued to talk to  some of my closer friends she had messaged.My gf and I have hit the 9 months of dating now and my moms texting of her had ramped up considerably. She almost texts GF more than I do. Mom is overbearing and has began complaining to her and talking about me (little embarrassing childhood moments). I hate it. I told her to stop and she said “at least I won’t be an awful mother in law”. If she keeps going like this she may not get to be a mother in law. She does this same thing with the friends to a lesser degree (some are now very awkward around me as they weren’t close before but this has pushed them away). I’m terrified she will do the same for my gf.  She won’t stop. She even emailed my college professor to check up on my grade (I’m doing well in classes but it wasn’t her place to do so (the prof shut her down and alerted me)).I recently went on a backpacking trip (my phone was without signal) with one of my best friends and she took this as the opportunity to go back and FB message my astranged Highschool Friends to try to arrange days for them to see me and her. I haven’t talked to many of these people in years. I got back and got mad and she said “your friends are my friends too”.She has done stuff like this since early HS but I wasn’t in a place to stop it nor was it as persistent and aggressive as it is now.I can’t have any accounts public nor tell her who I see but this makes her cast her net wider.I can’t do this any more. I don’t want to lose my family over this shit but I need freedom and the ability to have my own life.TLDR; My mom won’t stop texting my gf nor friends no matter what I do. It’s causing serious difficulty with my relationships.319 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
kue9rm,3.7kPosted by9 months agoArchived33Husband (32) gaming for 6+ hours a night
              
            RelationshipsWe've been married for 3 years and been together for 7. He is an avid gamer however its getting ridiculous now. I absolutely understand his need to game, it's his downtime and I would never ask him to stop altogether. However we haven't gone to bed together in over 2 years, he stays up till 3/4am every night gaming. I can't get any sleep, it's a small house so all I can hear is the clicking of the mechanical keyboard and him talking to the others online. He'll sleep till 12/1pm on the weekends, he games for most of the day and night, thinks spending an hour or 2 with me after I make dinner is 'quality time' (it really isn't). I've tried talking to him about this but it always escalates into a fight and he says that he'll be living a miserable life if he has to limit his gaming time.  I'm stuck doing all of the household chores while working full time and running my own business (a bakery). I love alone time as much as the next person but I feel so lonely as we can't do anything together because his world revolves around it. I have tried every approach and he won't budge. He turns it around on me saying that I'm being controlling, needy and that I'm changing him which I'm absolutely not, I have never asked him to stop and would never. He does work so I understand the need to escape and have time alone. Any advice is much appreciated.TL;DR Husbad games all night, refuses to see it may be a problem in our marriage671 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
kzmpla,3.7kPosted by9 months agoArchived5My (41F) husband (43M) is refusing (out of pride) to accept his parents financial help even though both of us are unemployed and in debt. I am honestly not sure what to do, we have a 6 year old kid with medical issues and we cant afford to keep up like this.
              
            RelationshipsMy husbands parents have a ton of money. I don't know the exact amount but I would guess just based on their buying and selling of property its somewhere in the 8-15 million range. My husband seemingly has always resented that he came from a rich background, he is a VERY do-it-yourself kind of guy and dislikes handouts. Even before the pandemic, his parents always offered to help us out with stuff and he always refused. We would argue about it but it was never that big of a deal because we were both financially stable. To him, this is a super sensitive topic, one which he wont even entertain. He always tells me to just act as if his parents have nothing.Last year, my son developed some medical issues. I'm not gonna go over them, its not deadly, but he does need expensive treatment and eventually likely surgery. I took off from work to watch him, which put a major dent in our finances. Fast forward to 4 months ago, and my husband lost his job. The past 4 months have seen us arguing non stop about finances. His parents have PLEADED with him non-stop to help us out, and he refuses. He would rather everybody suffer, and he is like, 110% deadset on fixing this situation himself. He is COMPLETELY confident that he will fix all of these issues on his own, that he will find a job or start a business that will save us. Meanwhile, medical bills have piled on, our mortgage payments are late, and we have effectively burnt through our savings. We quite simply cannot keep going like this.I mostly manage our finances. I think that, oddly enough, him growing up in a rich home and also getting a good job right out of college means that he doesn't entirely comprehend the kind of situation we are barreling towards, so even while he likes to sort of reject the benefits of having rich parents, in a way it also means he is blind to what it means to not be rich. Even while we are headed into debt, we haven't changed our lifestyles that much (we were frugal before this). The only difference has been debt piling up.I am not looking for financial advice. I am looking for a way to get my husband to accept his parents money. We have been looking everywhere for a job for him, and as of right now with unemployment through the roof and his industry especially having been destroyed, we have no prospects in the near future. There isn't much of a solution except his parents helping us out. How in gods name do I get him to accept the money? For me? For his KID who has medical issues which cost a fortune?TL;DR - - How do I get my husband to accept the money his parents are offering us? We are in debt and both unemployed and our kid has health issues, and he is refusing to take their offer.417 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
o32tvx,3.8kPosted by4 months ago2How do I (28f) tell my husband (30m) that I am not a fan of his greasy ponytail without sounding like a jerk?
              
            RelationshipsWhen we were dating and for most of our marriage (4 years) he has had short hair. It wasn’t until covid that he started growing it out.Now, I actually like his long hair. I love it when he wears it down and it’s clean. The problem is, he never wears it down and despite me trying to show him different things like conditioners and product and how to brush it, he’s never had long hair so he’s not used to the effort it takes to maintain. He doesn’t seem interested in learning, either. He washes it with soap and sometimes goes days without washing it at all, so he transforms from Jason Momoa into Ed from 90 day fiancé really quickly. It’s always tied back into a greasy, stringy ponytail, and he wears it in a high pony which I hate because it makes him look like a cheerleader. He also uses my bright pink scrunchies and bows when we are around the house because it’s convenient, and also because he thinks it’s funny, but I don’t find it attractive at all. I also don’t want to use my brush and my hair ties anymore after he does just because his hair is so nasty. Imagine if Jojo siwa didn’t wash her hair for five days. That’s what I’m married to.How do I go about this? I don’t really want to hurt his feelings, but the little hints I’ve been dropping like trying to show him how to take care of his hair have not been working. I’m starting to resent his total lack of effort into his appearance. It’s  one thing to not comb your hair one day or just stay in your pajamas, but his hair is just straight up gross and I cannot take it anymore.Tl;dr: husband grew out his hair when covid happened, has no interest in cutting it now that things are opening up, but refuses to take cake of his hair and I think it’s gross. How do you confront a partner about their hygiene and appearance when they let themselves go?Edit: thanks everyone for your suggestions. I don’t have time to answer everyone individually tonight, but the consensus seems to be that the time for sparing feelings has passed and a blunt conversation is the best way to go. I’m going to reread all your responses and put together what I want to say and give it a go. If it doesn’t go well, then I’ll take the advice of the one redditor who suggested I cut it off while he was sleeping.Edit #2: wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did. calm down folks, I’m not going to actually cut his hair while he’s sleeping, that was a joke. I might spray it with dry shampoo though.426 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
nxpoo5,3.7kPosted by4 months ago32UPDATE: My boyfriend gets panic attacks when I go out with my friends
              
            [new]UPDATE: It has been over a year since I (20f) made this post, and I only just realized that I 1.) never officially thanked you all for the responses, feedback, and support and 2.) never made an update on my situation.SO- Today is actually the one year anniversary of our breakup. Ending things was simultaneously the most challenging, yet best decision I could have made. We had a slow breakup that dragged on for a while; it was heartbreaking and incredibly painful but I’ve grown so much more than I ever could have imagined since then. Confident to say that I’m happier than I ever have been :)As for my ex(19m)- we’re still friends (respectively). We don’t hang out very often anymore, but we’re in the same friend group and so bump into each other here and there. We’ve also talked a few times since, just kind of checking in and seeing how the other is doing. I am very very happy to also report that he’s been seeing a therapist and is getting help for his mental health and trauma.My own mental health is also at an all time high —— through the breakup months and time after, I struggled really bad mentally, and considered seeing a therapist. At one point I could found relief in convincing myself that I had severe OCD. I joined r/ROCD (relationship OCD) after spiraling and self-diagnosing but have since unsubbed after many conversations and actual mental health help. Thanking every star that I had/have such a strong support system in my life (hi, parents, siblings, best friend).****This little tid bit is sort of irrelevant to the update, but I wanted to include it in case anyone else is struggling or finding themself in a similar situation or is just hurting and looking for support. My DMs are always open.TL;DR It’s my one year breakup anniversary but I’m doing better than ever and the ex-boyfriend is also doing good and is now in therapyOG POST79 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
i8uxei,3.6kPosted by1 year agoArchived2UPDATE: I (21 f) believe my boyfriend (32m) of 1 year is emotionally cheating on me &amp; I don’t know how to talk to him about it.
              
            UpdatesEdit: I’m just now looking at reddit since I posted this and I did NOT expect this many replies, holy baloney. Thank you all for your kind words, encouragement, and tough love ❤️ also, I just realized my title is weird, (&amp;) I think that’s because I’m on mobile and I copy/pasted the title from my previous post. Sorry about that!original post My original post didn’t get a lot of interest but there were a few people who asked for an update and I really just need to vent.The night that I made my original post, Rick called me to tell me he was going to visit his brother who lives in a nearby city (Jolene also lives in this city). As soon as he called I knew what was going to happen but I kept my mouth shut because I wanted concrete proof. He was sharing his location with me &amp;amp; I watched (and took screenshots of) him drive directly to her house, and stay there for 2.5 hours. I even texted my sister who lives about 20 min away from Jolene about it, and she drove there and took a video of his truck in her driveway.Needless to say I was absolutely pissed. I cried to my mom about it, then went to his house and packed up all my stuff &amp;amp; brought it to my parents place. Not long after I got back to their house he called me to tell me he was headed home.I asked him “so are you going to tell me the truth about where you were tonight?”He acted oblivious, said “I was just at my brothers, what are you talking about?”When I said “okay, if you’re going to lie to me that’s all I need to know” he immediately started apologizing, saying he just went there for a visit, he just wanted to see her daughter, and he wasn’t trying to hide anything from me.My favourite part was “if you would have asked I would have told you, all you had to do is ask!”Umm, I JUST asked you, and you lied to me??? So he asked if I would come and talk to him in person the next day.This is where Dumb Bitch Me ™ comes into play.I went the next day after work to talk to him. I asked him to be honest and tell me if he slept with her. He said no. We had a long conversation of him saying he fucked up but he didn’t want to lose me, etc. etc. At the end of it basically we decided to still be together, but that it was going to take a lot for him to regain my trust. My one condition for him was to not talk to her, and if she did talk to him, or visa versa, I needed to know about it. I told him if that makes me a psycho bitch then he should just break up with me.So for about 2 weeks we were still in a relationship but not spending near as much time together, saying I love you, or having sex. Basically it was like we “restarted”. HOWEVER during this time, she remained his best friend on Snapchat, and he continued to hide his phone from me. After two weeks I had gone to visit him, and we started talking about the situation. He was accusing me of cheating with someone to “get back at him” (with zero reason to believe this), saying he feels like he’s walking on eggshells and that I don’t trust him and he can’t trust me. I asked him what he wanted to do about it because at this point I was so done with putting in all the effort.He told me he wanted a break, and I told him I don’t do breaks. So we decided for a week we would just have some time to ourselves, but the rules of a relationship would still apply.I left to go back to work, and that week he went and stayed the night at her house 3 times.That week was so fucking hard for me, laying awake at night watching his location on my phone, knowing he was in bed with her. I barely wanted to exist, let alone go to work during the day.So that weekend, I went to see him again and broke it off for good. I decided on my drive there that I was going to keep it simple and not blow up at him, so all I said was “I don’t think we should be together anymore”. He hugged me, and his eyes got teary which was hard, but literally the next day him and Jolene were publicly dating, and still are.Now I’m dealing with the aftermath of them turning certain friends against me as well. I’m not sure what he says about me but I’ve already had a few people “unfriend” and “unfollow” me. I guess I just don’t understand how it’s not blatantly obvious to these people that he cheated on me but oh well. I wish I could tell everyone the whole story, and show them all the screenshots, so everyone would see what they really did but I know that’s not the right thing to do, and honestly it’s not the kind of person I am.The hardest part of this all has been the overwhelming feeling that I’m not good enough. I have always struggled with my self esteem, but this has completely destroyed my confidence, and I feel utterly worthless. I can’t get past the thought that I was just a placeholder for him until she wanted him again.TLDR: Rick went to see Jolene behind my back, I confronted him but we stayed together. He went and stayed the night at her house 3x so I broke up with him, now I am the bad guy and also Big Sad™258 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
i909r5,3.6kPosted by1 year agoArchived[UPDATE] Mom thinks our relationship could be better. I'm happy where it's at but don't know how to tell her.
              
            UpdatesOriginal Post HereTL;DR: I wrote down what I wanted to say, including boundaries. She didn't blow up, but as predicted, she didn't take responsibility either. But I've now done everything I can and can move on.No one asked for this update, but I guess I wanted to give some of you "told you so" rights? I was able to use bits and pieces from almost every comment. From preparing myself for it to not go well/needing to hang up on her, to making sure I didn't fall into the trap of explaining/listing out past incidents. I basically said the following:"I'm happy for [list of accomplishments she's had]. Unfortunately none of that erases 20+ years of lack of support and actions by you that clearly indicated I wasn't a priority. I'm not looking for explanations nor apologies. I've worked hard to make my peace with it, and I've worked hard to get our relationship to a point where I can maintain my mental health and have you in my life. So when you say it could be better, in my mind it's right where it needs to be. If that's to change at all, I have some boundaries that need to be followed: [list of boundaries, some specific but two big ones of Respect my boundaries and Respect when I say 'No']. If you want us to talk more, I'm happy to pick up the phone. You have every right to ask things from me, but have to respect when the answer isn't what you want to hear."First question was if I thought our relationship was better before my stepdad came around - No.Next was asking for examples when she didn't support me. I told her she'd have to do some reflecting because she was there for the same events I was, and it's not fair to me to ask for that emotional labor. She said she had done "lots" of reflection and couldn't see it "until [stepdad] came into the picture". She pushed a couple more times for examples. "Is it because I missed some events your dad was at?" She stopped when I called her out the second time for deflecting responsibility for her actions. I told her multiple times during this portion that she doesn't have to remember/own up to anything, but she does have to live with the consequences.Her last question was, "Is there any way we could ever push past this all?" I told her this is what "past this all" looks like. She pushed back a little bit, but when it was clear that I wasn't moving an inch, the call ended with "Well, thank you. You've given me a lot to think about."None of her questions or responses were any indication she was worried that I was hurt. She was trying to find justifications I might listen to, anything to poke holes. There was part of me that wondered if she always recognized how much neglect there was and just didn't want to face it, but claiming "lots" of reflection and not having a single incident come to mind that didn't involve blaming someone else answered that question. While she was "calm" while she tried to respond, her tone was very tense. Worst case here she continues to try to push boundaries and I cut off contact and it's one less stress in life, best case she respects them and it's one less stress in my life (I know this is likely a case of she'll respect them until she doesn't). The important thing for me was that I was up front with her and set clear boundaries. I've done my due diligence to telling her how our relationship could "change" (I used "change" instead of "improve" very intentionally with my mother). I'm relieved. Ball's in her court and I have some answers. Thanks again for the advice, sharing of your own experiences, and encouragement. It gave me the confidence and a plan for that phone call.Edit: some typosEdit 2: I'm relatively new to posting on Reddit so forgive any etiquette missteps please. First, thank you to the kind strangers for the awards! My first. Second, thank you to everyone that commented. I'm both happy and saddened that I'm not alone. I appreciate the perspectives that everyone brought; it gave me some new things to consider. Third, thank you for the recommendations for groups, books, resources! I fully recognize this is just one step in a lot to finding peace and have some reading to do. Good luck to everyone who's going through something similar, whether it's family or friends. Stay strong!212 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
j267bi,3.6kPosted by1 year agoArchived7My (25F) cousin (26F) resents me for not having an arranged marriage and blames me for hers.
              
            Non-RomanticAlmost all the marriages in my family have been arranged marriages. My mum’s marriage to my bio dad was an arranged marriage but it ended up in a messy divorce and him completely abandoning us before I was even born. My mum had a love marriage the second time, despite the disapproval of her family, and has been much happier with my stepdad than she probably would have ever been with my bio dad. Because of this, my mum has always been very adamant that she would not try to force us (my siblings and I) into arranged marriages despite what the rest of our family thought.I’ve been with my fiancé (26M) for 3 years now, we got engaged 2 months ago. He’s met my parents and siblings but as far as the majority of my extended family were concerned, I was single until 2 months ago. Early last year, my fiancé dropped me off home after work one day and my uncle was there. My uncle is the oldest sibling my mum has so he’s seen as the ‘head’ of the family (i.e. he thinks he has a say in what the rest of us do). It was obvious my uncle was pissed, and he ended up grilling my fiancé and I assume he met his standards (a lot of arranged marriages are about what both families can gain from one another (e.g. wealth, influence, etc.)) so he told my mum to get us married quickly (he wanted to make it look like we had an arranged marriage before the rest of our family found out). My mum ignored him and told us to keep dating if it’s what we wanted. Over the past year, he’s mentioned me getting married to my mum every single time he’s spoken to her.Apparently, my uncle assumed just because he’d given the ‘order’ that we were going to get married soon. He told my cousin (his daughter) that I had agreed to an arranged marriage and because I had and she was older, she should agree to the match he’d found her. My cousin never mentioned this to me, but she did agree to marry the man my uncle found for her. They got married late last year. They haven’t had a good marriage and my cousin is very unhappy. Her husband is incredibly controlling and hardly ever lets her go anywhere without him or a member of his family.Last week, she was over at my house when my fiancé came over to drop some of the clothes I’d left at his place over. When I told my family about my engagement, they all assumed it was an arranged marriage and I didn’t bother clarifying because it really isn’t anyone’s business. You don’t tend to do sleepovers if you’re having an arranged marriage, so my cousin knew immediately it wasn’t what she assumed. She started asking me questions about my relationship and I answered honestly. She got really angry at me and kept demanding to know why I didn’t tell her about him. The thing is, I’m very close to this cousin but I also know how our family is about dating and I didn’t want my male cousins trying to strongarm my fiancé (they’ve jokingly threatened this before). She pretty much blamed me for her arranged marriage and said she only agreed because she thought I was going to have one too and if I had told her I had a boyfriend, she would have had the courage to stand up to her family. She hasn’t spoken to me since.I do feel bad for her. I know how unhappy she is but if she had mentioned what my uncle told her earlier, I would have clarified. I don’t want this to be the end of our relationship, but I don’t know what I can do to fix this. Please help.TL;DR – My cousin agreed to an arranged marriage because she thought I was also going to have one. She’s since realised I’m having a love marriage and is blaming me for letting her agree to an arranged marriage when I had no intentions of having one myself.187 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted

hn0j6j,3.5kPosted by1 year agoArchivedMe (29F) with husband (30M) who is a childcare know-it-all and isn't letting me bond with baby (.08M) on my own
              
            RelationshipsSooo in the middle of this whole pandemic we’ve managed to start a family. Life is tough with a one-month old but I’m afraid my husband’s very helpful behavior is actually very unhelpful.My husband grew up in a big family and is very familiar/comfortable with the care of children and babies, including small infants. I had the opposite experience. When we decided to have a baby, for me it was kind of as if we’d decided to start a llama farm. I had zero experience or prior knowledge and I had to do (and still do) a ton of research.It doesn’t help that I have severe PPD. I have already been seeing a therapist for a long time for depression/anxiety and have been put on an SSRI by my GP. So if you tell me to see a therapist and/or get medicated I’ll ignore you because I’ll know you haven’t even bothered to read my post.The problem is that my husband (and his mother, who is actually a lovely and helpful woman who is bugging me for the same reason he is) is always swooping in to show me how to actually do things.I don’t have the muscle memory to execute the optimal way to fix a diaper or fill a formula bottle. My logical brain is confident that I’m not going to kill my baby but the depression and constant wearing down by husband and MIL is getting to me. They also know I’m not going to kill the baby but they always seem to know JUST what to do and when they see me struggling with something it’s like they’re hovering with itchy fingers just waiting to take over. The even more annoying thing is they’re right; whatever they do to soothe the baby and get him to sleep works like a charm. So on top of knowing I need to learn this shit myself I feel like a failure.I feel watched and surveilled in my own home and like I’m not getting one-on-one time with the baby. I feel incompetent and helpless. I can feel learned helplessness setting in. I feel useless. I’ve chosen not to breastfeed for several reasons so it’s like the baby really doesn’t need me. (I logically know this isn’t true because of attachment and all that but again, the severe depression speaks.)I know someone’s going to be like wHy dOn’T yOu JuSt TaLk tO HiM. Well no shit, I HAVE. Multiple times. I’ve told him he needs to like, go out somewhere and take a break and just let me handle things so I can learn and bond with the baby on my own. He says “Okay, okay, I get it,” and then seems to promptly forget we ever had the conversation. He amazingly has selective amnesia regarding this specific topic. Ditto his MIL. He’s a very fatherly person so he wants to be all over the baby all the time, which obviously I get, but it results in this issue.My family all lives far away so I’m stuck with these two. I really have vivid and deeply satisfying fantasies of taking my sharpest kitchen knife to both of their faces (which I want to say is just the PPD talking, but seriously I’m infuriated). But outwardly I’m too tired to protest. I’m tired all the time and I just want to be left alone. I feel like I’m being tortured in some kind of weird way and it kills me that we’re not all able to just chill and enjoy this special time with the newborn.I told husband I think maybe we should try couples’ counseling and his jaw very nearly hit the floor. He’s a great guy overall obviously so he was open to this idea but I could tell he was totally dumbfounded and couldn’t tell what the problem was. So I told him I just don’t feel heard and I feel like both he and his mom are overbearing. So then he got sad and was all like “I’m just trying to help, I know it’s tough to be a new mom.” I got REALLY angry with him and said some not very nice things which I regret. My husband has (bizarrely) never dealt with mental illness so I think he’s really freaked out by the PPD.Later I heard him talking to his mom in whispered and concerned tones about my mental health. So I feel like he is pathologizing this specific problem. I feel like I’m going crazy. Which I guess I already am. But you know. Is it going to kill either of them to watch me fumble a bottle or deal with a couple blowouts a few times?My Amazing Husband I Can’t Complain About has already taken it on himself to find a couples’ counselor. Which obnoxiously is making me feel guilty, like, am I really complaining about nothing when I clearly have such a great guy? I mean, I know I’m not. But it’s driving me crazy.Any advice in advance of us seeing this counselor would be really appreciated.TL;DR: MIL and Husband are childcare know-it-alls and preventing me from learning and bonding with the baby on my own. Yes, I talked to him and no, it hasn’t solved the problem.519 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
ibfil4,3.5kPosted by1 year agoArchived32I love you too soon update
              
            UpdatesHi,Original post was here  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i2ymiq/saying_i_love_you_too_soon/Thought I'd drop a quick update as so many nice people gave advice.I was definitely over thinking things and suspect I was just being over worried due to his widower status (I've never really consciously associated that to him before I started reading some of the replies to my original post)Over the past few weeks I've stayed at his more often than not and things have been great.He hasn't said "I love you" yet but here's a list of things he has said/done that helped me realise not saying it doesn't mean he's not feeling it....In no particular order:The little messages in the morning/evening on the rare occasions I didn't stay at his. Yup he's still thinking of me even when I'm not there.He ordered some toiletries for me on his weekly shop so I had some at his place too (After checking with me what I'd need) Plus I'm getting invited to join his "meal planning" discussions where everyone one in the house gets to pick at least 1 meal for the coming week (This is making me feel like part of the family and not just a guest)He's cleared out some drawer and wardrobe space in his bedroom so I can keep stuff at his too (this one was pretty huge to me)When his daughter asked "Is Miss teacher going to live with us forever? his reply was a cheeky little smile and a "Not yet" - yup irrational or not the "yet" sent a few flutters off :DHe's really open about everything. He's admitted to me that at one point in his life he really didn't believe that he'd be capable of love again (in a romantic way) but he knows now that's not true (Perhaps irrationally on my part - I really did read that as "I love you" Just in a, I really can't say it way)He's arranged for his parents to have the kids this weekend so we can have a night away and a date or two because and I quote "You deserve to be treated like a princess too sometimes and I don't want you to feel I only want you around for the children"He's posted a few pictures on social media of us (with and without the children) my favourite being a selfie of all four of us snuggled on the sofa with the caption "Star Wars night with the family - life is good"After the previously mentioned Star Wars night, whilst we were being intimate I let slip another "I love you" in the heat of the moment and he replied "I know" which if you're a bit of a Star Wars fan (which we both are) is kind of the cool guys way of saying it. A little bit nerdy I know!TLDR: An update on my last post. Partner still hasn't said "I love you" directly but I'm 99.9999999% sure that he does. And I've definitely not scared him off lol192 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
jqezuc,3.5kPosted by11 months agoArchivedMy (26F) husband (26M) cut his family off because they didn’t want us to get married. His grandfather (80/90sM) is sick, and he’s still refusing to speak to them.
              
            RelationshipsMy husband and I met in college. His family were nice whilst we were dating but did a 180 when they found out my husband was planning to propose. They tried to convince him not to and threatened to disinherit him/financially cut him off (they never went through with the latter) if he did. He’d warned me that his family were elitist when we met, so I wasn’t that shocked by their reaction. In the end, he proposed and cut them off completely.They tried apologising before our wedding, but my husband refused to talk to them and wouldn’t invite them.Fast forward to now we’ve been married for over two years and his sister reached out to me over Facebook. She said she’d been trying to contact my husband for a week, but he wouldn’t respond to her or any of their family and she didn’t want to deliver the news in a message. She asked me to ask him to call her. I mentioned it to my husband, and he said he wasn’t going to do it, and that this was another one of their games to try and get him to contact them. I relayed the message to my SIL, and she ended up telling me that their grandfather was very sick, and he was desperate to see my husband again. Their family is worried he isn’t going to make it.I tried to tell my husband this but he’s adamant that they’re lying despite his sister having sent me pictures as proof (he refuses to look at them). His parents have both called me to apologise for how they behaved again and are begging me to convince my husband to see reason.My husband’s grandfather is the person he was closest to and I know if he passes away without them making up, my husband won’t be able to live with himself. I know he’s still hurt by how his family reacted, but I think he’s letting that cloud his judgement. How do I make him see that they’re not lying when he’s in so much denial?TL;DR – My husband’s family were unhappy about him proposing to me and tried to force him not to. He ended up cutting them off and he’s continued to stay NC despite them apologising and reaching out several times over the years. Now his grandfather is sick, and he thinks they’re lying despite sending us proof and is adamant about continuing to ignore them.312 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
j2hohg,3.5kPosted by1 year agoArchived324How can I (29F) get over the fact that I'm not my best friend's (30F) best friend?
              
            Personal issuesIn 2013 after an exceptionally bad breakup and graduating from college, I moved to a New City and basically started my life over. After a few weeks of subletting, I found a roommate on Craigslist named Kasie (30F) who I hit it off with immediately. I've always been more of a 'boyfriend girl' in that I was with my ex from tenth grade until college graduation and he was basically my 'best friend' so Kasie was my first real girl BFF.We lived together for four years until Kasie moved in with her boyfriend Jason (32M) and we had the best time. We almost never fought and spent all of our time at home together. We are both incidentally from the same home state, have a lot of similar interests and personalities and complement each other in lots of ways. I get along super well with Jason too and they never made me feel like a third wheel. I have a larger friend group now in New City and (thankfully) lots of girl friends but Kasie is still my bff and we talk/text constantly, hang out weekly, etc.The problem: Annie (30F). Annie is Kasie's best friend. They've been best friends since their early 20s and are kind of a package deal. Annie is very cool and smart and funny and she and I are  good friends too and there's no competition between us or anything. She and I even hang out without Kasie sometimes. I can't stress enough that we all get along and that this isn't like the movie 'Bridesmaids' or anything!But... sometimes I feel really sad that Kasie is MY best friend, but Annie is hers. Kasie will refer to me as 'one of her best friends' but we all know that Annie is #1. If Kasie ever says something like, 'You're my favorite!' to Jason he laughs and says, "No, that's Annie.' If Kasie and Jason get married, Annie will be maid of honor, no question. Everyone kind of says 'Kasie-and-Annie' like they're one entity. They have very big and beautiful matching tattoos (though Kasie and I have matching tattoos too, but imagine it being something like a 1 inch potato because we're both from Idaho, whereas Kasie and Annie have gorgeous tattoos that cover most of their upper arm).I don't know how to get over this sadness. It feels really childish. Kasie doesn't ever make me feel left out and neither does Annie. I love them both. But I guess I'm just jealous that I'm not anyone's 'favorite' in the same way. It feels extra childish of me because I have a boyfriend and I know I'm his favorite, but I guess I just never got to experience having a girl BFF who also considered me her BFF like that. How can I be satisfied with being almost-the-best and not the best?TL;DR: My best friend, Kasie, has her own best friend, Annie. How can I get over feeling like I'm second best?300 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
mij4ms,3.5kPosted by6 months agoArchived23UPDATE: My (20F) friend (20F) tried to hook up with my boyfriend (22M) a few weeks ago and he didn't tell me about it
              
            Updateshttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mh0zpp/my_20f_friend_20f_tried_to_hook_up_with_my/So, I told my boyfriend that I understand why he did it and that I get that he wanted to avoid hurting me but that he doesn't get to make that choice for me. He said he understands that he should have told me, but that he had kind of hoped that she was just having a weird moment and that it wouldn't happen again and we'd avoid the entire thing completely.  I told him that from now on I want him to be upfront with me about this kind of thing. I also told him that if he was worried about if I'm going to believe him over my "friend" or not he shouldn't be. Because I honestly suspected that she was into him anyway, I would have definitely believed him.Anyway, I feel like he totally understood where I'm coming from. If anything this whole thing kinda made us be in on the same page about this type of stuff.I want to thank everyone for the advice because I was honestly getting paranoid because I've been cheated on before and my friends are kinda cynical so they expected the worst which me made me do the same. Ironically because of this whole thing and the talk we had after, I feel like I can trust him more. For now I'm gonna try to stop assuming the worst.Thanks to everyone who chipped in.TLDR: My boyfriend and I had a talk about what happened. He explained to me his point of view and I explained to him mine. He understood why I was upset and I feel like we really got on the same page. So, everything worked out for the best.151 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
iijj64,3.4kPosted by1 year agoArchivedComments are locked2I(32m) am in love with my former sister inlaw(27f)
              
            RelationshipsI posted this inR/Relationship_advice, but it got buried and I got only three replies so looking for advice here.TLDR at Bottom This will be a long post.I'm  finally at a point where I can't stand this anymore. I've been in love  with this woman for a very long time, maybe a couple of years at this  point and I'm not sure if I should just kill it or attempt to make  something with her.I met my  ex-wife, her sister, when I was 23-years-old and the relationship  developed very quickly and by 26 I had my son and daugther and had  gotten married. However, within months of being married my ex-wife had  an affair, but worse than that the man she cheated with had gotten her  into Heroin. After confronting her on this she said she was going to get  help, but instead she left in the night. I haven't heard from her in 4  years and last I've heard she's still with that guy and are homeless in  Las Vegas. Not sure how true that is, but being focused on holding it  together for the kids, I really don't have the time to chase her down,  nor do I want to after what she pulled.I  ended up getting a divorce in absentia. I did however maintain a very  positive relationship with my inlaws after the fact. Every other weekend  my kids stay over with their grandparents on that side and they pretty  much treat me like a son still, I still go to parties at Christmas and  am reasonably liked by the family. Nobody talks about my ex anymore  mainly to not worry my kids. My oldest, my son is very hurt by his  mother leaving. He's 9 now and I've had to get therapy for him after he  told me he hoped his mother was dead. She had been getting verbally  abusive toward the end which was when he was around 5 or 6Anyhow,  in the year following my ex leaving, her sister and my her boyfriend  had started coming around a lot to see the kids. They knew I worked a  lot and would babysit and call it practice as they wanted to have  children of their own. My kids love them and were spoiled by them, which  I didn't mind because we all needed a little positivity. They got  married and were very in love. However, her husband was killed in a  workplace accident shortly after the birth of their daughter.It  has been extremely rough and painful for everyone involved as one can  imagine. I followed my Sil's example and began to take her daughter to  give her time to herself if things got too hard to deal with or she  needed alone time. She's been in grief counciling for a few years but  she still wears her ring and has told me she can't ever imagine dating  again. I talk to her about him frequently and she's gotten to a better  place but she's still very much in love with him, I can't imagine that  sort of pain.Over the last two  years we've been a more constant figure in each others lives. My kids  love their aunt and I have her over for dinner a couple times a week. My  daughter and her daughter have become close and love being around each  other so they have sleepovers. I've moved on from my ex by this but the  idea of dating possibly someone dangerous as their mother has kept me  out of the dating scene.I don't  know when it happened, but slowly I began to get soft on my SIL. She's a  great mom for what she's had happen to her. She's one of the sweetest  people I know and her sense of humor always leaves me laughing and  happy. Then I started realizing that I'm physically attracted to her.  I've always felt kind guilty about it because her late husband was a  good friend and since she's obviously is still grieving, so I've kept it  to myself.Since Covid started  we've been together a bit more because social distancing has had us lose  contact with most other people. Nothing romantic has ever been  discussed and I try not to flirt, but last week it was very late and  after the kids went to bed I made us a few drinks, not enough to get  drunk but she decided she'd rather spend the night, so I took my couch. I  woke up to breakfast this morning and the four of us felt like the sort  of family I've always wanted. She even kissed my forehead which is not  something she normally does. I still didn't say anything, but after she  left I found my son quietly playing with his toys in his room. He looked  upset so I asked him if he was alright.He  tells me point blank in the way only a kid can that he wishes Sil was  his mother. I sat down with him and asked him why he thought that way  and he gave a whole bunch of reasons her being nice to him, that she  never yells about anything. He likes seeing her at his grandparents and  she draws pictures with him, which I didn't know they did. By the end of  it my heart that is already melting for this woman even more wound up.When  visiting dropping them off with their grandparents, I tried to breach  the subject with her folks to kinda feel around how people would see. I  made a joke about she and I acting like a married couple sometimes and  they didn't laugh and were kind of stand offish, friendly but either  they know something or they disapprove.It's  getting too hard for me to ignore or pretend it's not getting to me.  I'm in love with her. Either I've got to kill it and find some way not  to think of her, or I have to find some sort of way to navigate through  this situation and tell her everything. If anybody out there has any  insight on how to approach a widow, especially one who was married to a  friend, with this sort of intention I could really use your help.TLDR-  Sil and I became close after my divorce to her sister and death of her  husband. She's great with my kids. I'm in love and don't know how to  proceed.100 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
kmiu1k,3.4kPosted by10 months agoArchivedMy dad (74) trashed my apartment. I want to kick him out, but my wife says she thinks it's "not the right thing to do".
              
            Non-RomanticRecently my wife and I went on a vacation for two weeks. We're lucky that in our country, COVID has been kept at bay, so travelling within the country is pretty easy.My dad lives in our apartment.  He doesn't pay rent. While we were away, he continued living there. Upon our return, the place had pretty much been trashed.There were fast food wrappers all over the floor, in the living room and bedrooms. Dirty shirts (several of them mine) being washed in the kitchen sink. Toilets in the bathrooms clogged up. One of the windows was left open during a rainstorm, letting rainwater in. Open condiment jars and cold cuts left out. Moldy food on the stove. A dozen half-finished coffees everywhere. Laundry just thrown on the floor in the living room. Appliances that were working perfectly fine before we left broken.He is actually in good shape mentally, but he's just always been a slob.This isn't the first time he's abused our space. He refuses to live by my rules, even though the house is in my name. A while back, he allowed his friends to use our home as a meeting place. When one of them started trying to recruit people for a MLM, I said that the party was over and that I wanted everyone off my property.  I called the cops and unfortunately in the heat of the moment, I lost my temper in front of them by saying if f the cops didn't remove them from my property, I would do so with force.  My dad then got upset with me because I had "disrespected" his friends and made him look bad.I talked to my wife about it, and while she acknowledges that my dad is a slob and a hoarder, she doesn't want to kick him out because he gave us money towards the home for our wedding.  She said that if something happened to him it would weigh on her conscience if she sided with me in asking him to leave.TL;DR - Dad trashed my apartment and I want him to leave.  Wife said she feels bad about asking him to leave because dad gave us some money to buy the house and because of the risk of something happening to him.424 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted

nti1h4,3.3kPosted by4 months ago3846UPDATE: LDR boyfriend (M23) cheated on me (F20) after 3 years together with another girl (F<20) - do I tell the other girl?
              
            UpdatesUpdate to this post. TL;DR from that post is: Boyfriend of 3 years cheating with someone else, they've been together for 9 months. I broke up with him. She doesn't know I exist. She sounds severely depressed, suicidal and self-harms plus issues with drugs and alcohol. He asked me not to tell her as she would "kill herself". Unsure if I should - moral conundrum. Help.I told her. Sent her a long message from my own instagram account (no burners or anything). Lots of empathy and kindness. Told her I was on her side. She asked for proof, sent that through.Ex texted me 5 mins later with "You did it hey?" (I'd blocked him on all social medias except for phone number). Then he weirdly thanked me; said it was better for his head and mental health now. I did him a favour. Baffled me a little. Sent him a couple harsh text messages explaining it wasn't for him, but for her. She deserved the truth. He apologised again, lol, and then I sent him a final message and blocked.Girl seemed devestated, not angry at me thankfully as I was scared of her spinning it against me which I don't think I could've handled in my... delicate state lol. Told her I was there for her. Had a little chat, but haven't talked to her since (12hrs ago). Not expecting to continue talking. Dunno if she properly broke up with him, or taking a break since they still follow eachother but she changed her profile pic so it's no longer matching and relationship date from her bio is gone. None of my business what happens next, I just hope she's okay and takes the next steps which are healthy for her. No idea if she's suicidal/self-harming - I had that in the long message sent to her that 'he told me you were vulnerable and suffering from depression so I debated sending this msg but I think you deserve the truth'. Inevitably, I think it's better for her to know rather than confide in a liar who is abusing her vulnerability.Thank you to everyone who replied on the previous post, definitely helped to see other strangers agreeing with sending a message and informing her. If anyone ends up in a similar situ, I hope you never do, but send the message to the unknowing affair partner. It'll relieve your conscience I think, even though you're not in the wrong. That sounds weird, but trust me I know I was the one cheated on and that she was the 'other woman' but it still felt good to tell her what the real truth was, rather than him spinning it against me or never telling her. It's kinda like a final kaboom in my exes face, making sure he can't just go crawling to his other girlfriend now that I broke up with him, and she knew the full truth and can decide what to do next (break up or stay together).I feel relieved. I have finally stopped feeling nauseated and throwing up. Had my first good nights sleep since I found out. Nothing but bad feelings for the ex. I dunno if it's hate, that's a strong word. I resent what he put me through, and the waste of time, and the lies for such a long time. He's made me unsure of myself and everything he told me, but I have enough self-respect to break-up with him. Miss what I thought we had I think? I dunno. It was all lies I guess. I want him to figure himself out, mature and eventually settle down (not with me). Holding all my resentment against the cheating ex, not affair partner.The hurt is setting in now. Last couple days it was anger. Now it's just pain lol. Now, can anyone offer post-discovering-your-long-term-partners-been-cheating-on-you-for-almost-a-year advice? I'm not used to not being busy and am having too many thoughts, I just finished final exams so have been studying for months and been busy and now its... nothing. Glad I found out after exams, but not sure what to do now. Advice appreciated.TL;DR: Told the unknowing affair partner via Instagram DMs on my personal account. Long, empathetic message telling her I'm on her side + proof when she asked for it. Ex texted me "you did it hey?" and then thanked me. Blocked his number. She seems sad, unsure if 100% broken up but pfps and date in bio changed. I don't care, not my business. Hope for the best for her. Now I need advice on how to heal, if anyone has any. Thanks.118 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
ih4r1x,3.1kPosted by1 year agoArchived2My (32F) Fiance (34M) walked in on my therapy session, overheard, and is perhaps upset
              
            Relationships**EDIT: I shared an update (positive) in comments section, as 48 hours must elapse in order make a separate update post. Thank you all for the thoughtful and compassionate responses.Backstory: I (32F) have been with fiance (34M) for several years. I've been in therapy since 21. I am admittedly a "work in progress" as I always will be, though I would like to think that I try as hard as I can and have developed some strategies to utilizes when things seem to be spiraling. This has allowed me to have a stable home life, relationship turned engagement, and I've always been able to hold down a decent job.My fiance does not have mental health issues, but often acknowledges that he wishes he was in therapy to deal with how he handles frustration and crisis situations. He has insurance, but can't seem to find the time to make an appointment for himself. He respects and is proud of me for going to therapy myself and when I become extremely anxious about situations (even about things related to our communication) he encourages me to talk about it (but not in a diminishing or gaslighting way).Prior to COVID, I (like most others) went to see a therapist in-person. Now it happens virtually, and I actually find it more effective for some reason. When I talk about really difficult subjects I'm processing, I tend to raise my voice and cry. Fiance and I live in a small apartment and it has happened so far that he has been out of the house during my sessions, so this issue hasn't yet come up.Today, fiance unexpectedly came home for lunch in the middle of a session. I knew that he'd come back at some point but wasn't sure exactly when. While on the phone w therapist, I was pretty viscerally upset and going off about some deeply-rooted, abuse related issues about family and ex. Fiance got home and walked towards my room to say hi and opened the door. He walked on me me speaking about something in abstract, and quickly left the room. He went into the living room and put on a podcast, maybe in an effort for me not to be worried that he was eavesdropping. So I figured he wasnt listening and continued to vent (about past resentment). Then But then I heard some shuffling outside my door in the hallway and when he coughed accidentally, it made clear how close he was. It was a super awkward situation all around and I'm not sure how I should have handled it.He then left the apartment and I'm not sure if I upset him. I'm also wondering if I messed up by not warning him in the morning that I would be in an appointment later. I had a million other work related things to do today on the forefront of my mind. I texted him that I'm sorry I missed him, and no response for an hour.  If I did in fact upset him, not sure how/if to apologize, so any advice would be appreciated.tldr; fiance came home unexpectedly, most likely overheard me venting about serious issues unrelated to him, left abruptly and I'm afraid I upset him183 commentssharesavehidereport94% Upvoted
hzkdbw,3.1kPosted by1 year agoArchivedI [24F] don’t want to furnish a guest room for my mother [64F] in my new home.
              
            Non-RomanticTL;DR Mom is very excited that I’m going to have a spare bedroom. I’m flooded with apprehension. I don’t know if my feelings are justified or not. ——————————————————————-My partner [24M] and I are moving into a 1300 sq ft 2/2 townhome this week. Our current apartment is a snug 350 sq ft 1/1.I’ve been working from home out of our bedroom since mid-March. This hasn’t done wonders for my mental wellbeing. Moving into a bigger place has been a light at the end of the tunnel these last few months.I’m particularly happy about having a second bedroom, as my partner agreed that I should turn it into my home office. (I expect to continue working from home for quite a while longer.)In my excitement, I told both my parents all about the new place as soon as our application was approved.(Context on my parents: My parents are divorced. They live in my hometown, roughly an eight hour drive away.)When I mentioned the second bedroom in the townhome to my mom, she immediately began talking about staying in “her guest room”. I told her that I was going to turn the spare room into a home office, but she just replied “with a sleeper sofa!” She then began talking excitedly about how she’d be able to drive up and visit “often”. I didn’t know what to say, but something in my gut turned.My mom works at an airport in a COVID hotspot. I have asthma that gets worse when I get sick, so I can’t take any chances with COVID. Knowing this, my mom has been trying for months to push me to visit her, and she’s been asking repeatedly if she can come visit me. (She has outright refused to quarantine herself for two weeks prior to seeing me.)I put my foot down and told her that any travel was out of the question, and she kind of accepted that. She still complains about it every time we talk though, and she still asks even though she knows the answer is no. Recently, she asked me if I needed her to come visit to help me move. After that didn’t work, she asked if she could come visit in August to “see the new place” and celebrate her birthday. I felt guilty about saying no, so I gave a very noncommital response.At this point, I’m not even sure if I’d want to see her even if she did quarantine for two weeks beforehand. My mom gets way too pushy when she doesn’t get her way, and it makes me very uncomfortable. The problem is, she’s also extremely giving and generous, so it makes me feel guilty denying her requests.She’s constantly offering to give me money I don’t need, and she tries to lend a helping hand in every situation without being asked. She has offered to pay for graduate school for me and pay for my living expenses, because she wants me back in school. (We had that arrangement when I was in undergrad, but the money was never as reliable as she said it would be. Having independence and a stable job has been a godsend. I’m never relying on her financially again.)I almost think she’s generous so that she has leverage to push people around with. I don’t think she’s doing it in a conscious, malicious way, though. I think she does it because having control and feeling like a good person makes her happy.In the past, when I’ve told her “no”, she has gone straight to guilting me. On one occasion, she wanted to stay the night with my partner and I in our tiny little apartment. I told her that my partner’s family, who live in town, would be more than happy to have her as a guest. In fact, they had already prepared the guest room for her. She cried and said that I “didn’t want her”, and she basically had a meltdown. I told her we didn’t have room or an air mattress, so she’d have to sleep on the floor. I told her that this was unacceptable, and that I would not allow my mother to sleep on grubby carpet. She then threatened to drive all the way back home overnight, after having driven all the way from home that day. When we didn’t back down, she went through with the threat. I couldn’t sleep that night out of fear, worrying about her crashing the car from sleep deprivation.My partner has held my mother in poor regard ever since that incident. He really doesn’t want her to stay with us in the future. I could blame things on him and tell her that he’s the reason why she can’t stay with us, but that’s not fair to him. Plus, she might try to retaliate in some way, and I don’t want that.***Actual TL;DR, after writing out my feelings: How do I tell my mother that my home office isn’t her guest bedroom? How do I tell her that she can’t come visit me in August?I don’t even want to have her sleeping on an air mattress in my home office, because I’m uncomfortable leaving her alone with my belongings. She has gone through my things at least once in the past.She keeps texting me, asking me how moving is going. Every time I see her texts, I feel a mix of discomfort and guilt. It makes me want to throw my phone away.Reddit, please help? —————————————————————Edit: Wow, I’ve never had a post receive this much attention before. It’s interesting how many comments I’ve received guilting me for not wanting my mom to visit right now. The majority of comments were really constructive and supportive, but a noticeable minority basically told me “you’ll miss your mom when she dies” and “she’s divorced and lonely and loves you, you ungrateful child”. Here I go JADE-ing at those comments. (Good term, thank y’all for teaching it to me!)I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she’s completely disregarding COVID, and I am in a high-risk group. My dad’s health isn’t great either and I worry about him, as they live near one another and still see each other.I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she doesn’t care for LGBT people, and both my partner and I are bisexual.I’m uncomfortable around my mom because I went on a friendly mall date with a (gasp) non-white boy once in my teens, and she told me she “didn’t want a nappy-haired grandchild”.I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she has had a history of psychosis. When she’s under stress, she can act in ways that don’t always make sense. When I was little, it was worse, and she scared me a few times.I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she’s not very good with money, and she has asked me for money before. Even though she makes thousands more a month than I do. (She wanted to buy a big-ticket item, and didn’t want to save for a month to buy it.)I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she handled divorcing my dad really poorly, and didn’t seem to care for how I felt at all. I was twelve. She discouraged me from talking to my dad, took me away traveling on weekends I was supposed to see him, and she tried to get a restraining order on him. She had no reason to do that. She actually took me with her to court that day, and it was all I could do not to run over and hug my dad. I think I did hug him, actually, and he had to tell me it wasn’t allowed. He and I were so close before the divorce, and we’re still trying to fix our relationship.I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she didn’t step in or do anything when I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with an adult male as a teenage girl. He was 22, and I was 16, and she let him sleep in her house. Of course I thought it was a good idea at first, but I was in too deep very quickly. He was coercive, mean, and selfish. I needed my mom to step in and act like a parent, maybe by kicking him out and forbidding me from seeing him. Instead, she enabled the whole thing. I had to “break up” with this man, and that was only after he tried to coerce me into marrying him.I’m uncomfortable with my mom because she always wants me to approve of her bad decisions, and gets angry when I don’t.I’m uncomfortable around my mom because when she saw that I was anxious as a little kid, she forced pills on me and took me to a psych ward (completely unprompted, I was discharged the same day). When I got “better” after gaining some independence, I told her that I stopped taking the pills because they made me feel sick. She then freaked out and told me I needed to take them, or I’d get anxious again and “lose everything” that I’d built. I’ve been trying to make myself “well” for years. But I’ve never lost control of my life since I got it.I’m uncomfortable around my mom because she  wants me to get married and have her grandchildren, but I would never want her to influence any child I ever had.But yes. I’m guilty. Bad and ungrateful child. Going to regret having boundaries when she dies. For sure. (Shame about all the time I missed with my dad that I’ll never get back when he dies, but yeah.)I may not be sure how to have a healthy relationship with my mom, but acquiescing to guilt isn’t it, chief. Thanks tho.296 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
k6jeuj,3.1kPosted by10 months agoArchived[UPDATE] My (M26) German coworker (F29) invited me to a sauna
              
            UpdatesPrevious post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/k34mi8/my_m26_coworker_f29_invited_me_to_a_sauna_what/Hi!Short recap: My (M26) German coworker (F29) of one year, who I like and have a good friendly, slightly bantery relationship with, had excitedly invited me to go to a mixed sauna with her "once the pandemic is over" after she heard from me that I have never been to a sauna. I was asking for advice if this meant she may be interested in something romantic or if she may just like saunas (being German and all where nudity often isn't such a big deal).Update: After trying to gather my courage over the weekend to ask her out, she told me on Monday that she has matched with someone on a dating app and was very excited to meet them and talked quite a bit about them the whole weekI think she either never intended to indicate any romantic interest or realized over the weekend that her invitation could have been seen as something flirty, so she decided to tell me about her love life - to set the record dtraight so to speak. In either case, it seems not to have meant anything.Regardless: Thanks a lot for the advice, it could have very well meant something else!-------------------------------------------------TDLR; My coworker invited my to a mixed sauna after the lockdown is over but it seems to have been meant as something innocent as she talked a lot this week about meeting a match on a datung app.160 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
hro3xn,3.1kPosted by1 year agoArchivedComments are lockedMy (27f) boyfriend (23m) tried to throw out our bed so he could play a video game
              
            RelationshipsMe and my boyfriend have been living together for about a year now and for a while he's been really interested in virtual reality. Now the problem is that our tiny studio apartment isn't big enough to jump around in. He knows this, I know this, and we've had multiple conversations about how it's a shame we don't live in some huge house where we could dedicate an entire room to something like that.I went out yesterday for a walk and a picnic yesterday and came back to my boyfriend dismantling our bed. I assumed something had broken and asked what had happened. Nothing was broken. He'd managed to order an oculus quest headset and had made the executive decision that we could swap our double bed for a Japanese futon??There is no fucking room for this. Even if we lived on the ground floor (which we don't), and I was willing to sleep on the floor (which I'm not), the room just isn't big enough. It would dominate the entire room. Am I supposed to crouch in the kitchen whilst he plays? Our entire home is being compromised for what is effectively a video game.I honestly don't really know what to say. He thinks he's being entirely reasonable to do this without involving me. I don't even know what to say to him here since the whole thing seems so ridiculous and he's so obviously being unreasonable yet is oblivious and keeps saying I'll really enjoy vr and it'll all be worth it. I told him I was worried he'll damage the TV or my art supplies and he is convinced it won't be a problem as they have sensors for that.I love my boyfriend and he's always been entirely reasonable and level headed until now and we always discuss everything. How do I get through to him about this? If it wasn't so difficult right now I'd be considering moving out or leaving. I told him I'd throw it out the window when it arrived unless he was going to sit down and have a serious conversation about this but he just won't take anything I say seriously.TL;DR My boyfriend bought a vr headset and wants to remove our bed to play it in our tiny studio apartment and can't see this is unreasonable.495 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
nit3wr,3.1kPosted by5 months agoMy (57M) daughter (32F) is refusing to speak to me because I went on a trip while she’s struggling financially.
              
            [new]I have four daughters – two biological (“Sarah” 32F & “Suzie” 30F) and two stepdaughters (“Amy” 31F & “Annie” 28F). My oldest daughter and youngest stepdaughter don’t really like each other anymore. They’re barely civil, and they completely ignore each other unless they’re forced to interact.Sarah is struggling financially. It’s partly due to the pandemic but mostly due to her husband and his lack of work ethic or financial sense. He spends money faster than they earn it and we’ve bailed them out multiple times already. The pandemic has hit me hard financially so I’m no longer in a position to help them.On the other hand, Annie is married to a wealthy man and has generously been helping everyone (excluding Sarah) financially for the past year.Annie invited my wife and me to join her family at her in-law’s holiday home. She offered to cover all of our expenses and my wife missed her a lot, so we agreed to go. We didn’t really think about how it would make Sarah feel.Sarah found out about the trip and is now furious at me. She thinks I’m lying about not having money to help her and doesn’t believe Annie would pay for it. She is refusing to speak to me and has told Suzie she feels like I replaced them with my stepdaughters.I would really like to fix this, but she continues to ignore any attempt by me to get into contact with her.TL;DR – I went on a trip to visit my stepdaughter, she covered all of our expenses but my oldest daughter, who is struggling financially,  doesn’t believe me and is now refusing to speak to me.338 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
m1ak1z,3.0kPosted by7 months agoArchivedMy (17F) sister (15F) smells really bad and every time I try to tell her she takes it as teasing
              
            Non-RomanticSorry for any errors, I’m writing this on mobile. So my sister has never been one for good hygiene. She didn’t take brushing her teeth seriously until she got two cavities and to this day refuses to brush her tongue so her breath smells bad (I sometimes get on to her about it but she’ll lie and say she did). She’s never really taken care of herself because my mom has always babied her.Anyway, her bad habits have extended to her room. One of our dogs like to stay in her room, and because of that it will poop and pee on the pee pads we had to start placing. One of her only chores was to pick up the waste and keep her room clean, but she doesn’t. She will literally leave the poop there for days and rarely changes the pee pads, and it’s to the point where I have to go in daily now to do it. Not only that but she never cleans her mattress (we tried to once together and brown stuff kept coming off the mattress but it’s still not clean) and rarely washes her sheets. Because of all this and more, she smells terrible and I can’t stand the smell of her room (our rooms are right next to each other too so when my door is opened I can smell it).I have a really sensitive nose and some sensory issues so the stench always sends me into a sensory overload episode and I can’t really stand to be around her anymore. I try to tell her that she needs to wash her sheets and keep her room clean, but she just does the whole “no you” routine because she thinks I’m teasing her.I don’t know what to do. I’m going to college in a few months so I won’t be able to pick up after her and I don’t want this to keep going into her adult life. Does anyone have any advice on how to get her to listen to me seriously?TL;DR: My sister smells really bad because she doesn’t clean her room up and takes any advice from me as if I’m teasing her. I don’t know how to get her to listen.Edit: I want to clarify that the dog is a chihuahua and her room isn’t like covered in poop or anything. It’s just that there are small areas where the dog will poop and she’ll just ignore it while she does something else. Also, she usually smells fine after she takes a bath, the problem usually rises when she gets out of her room in the morning until she bathes again (because we generally stay in the living room and hang out in the evenings so she doesn’t really go back in there).313 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted

            UpdatesOh my gosh, thank you for the awards everyone. I feel overwhelmed. I’m so honoured by everyone telling me their stories, I’m saving this post forever to look at if I ever think I should go back. It’s crazy that strangers on the internet have showed me more support in two months than my ex (that feels weird to say lol) boyfriend has in a year is crazy! Thank you kind reddit friends for making my day. Oh, everyone is saying I should block him. I think I’m going to listen the first time this time and do it! i never thought of that but it’s probably safer for me and my growth... thank you again to everyone, I love you all!Previous Posttl;dr: i broke up with my emotionally abusive bf.Hi everyone. I posted this almost two months ago, this is been the worst year of my life (with most people I’d imagine lol) and these past two months have been hard too. I just wanted to update and say I broke up with him yesterday. After having a month of space from him i realise that I can’t be in a relationship where I feel like nothing I do is good enough, bc I’m just not good enough for him and I never will be. Idk if anyone would ever be good enough for him tbh. The thought of being single is really scary, and I do feel empty and I do think i’ll always live him, but for my sake i think it’s for the best it ended. Being without him is better than constantly feeling bad for just existing, i think.Honestly, the scariest thing is before I posted I didn’t even think anything was particularly wrong about our relationship. And I thought if it was it was my fault bc it couldn’t be his.So I just wanted to thank the people of this subreddit for waking me up. I was in denial at first but you guys were right. I’m so thankful for everyone who helped me.Stay safe everyone <3180 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
jv9s89,3.0kPosted by11 months agoArchived2I [17M] think my uncle/guardian [50sM] is afraid to tell me he’s gay.
              
            Non-RomanticMy parents died when I was younger so my uncle raised me, mostly on his own. When I was younger he was engaged to a woman but that was about it. Obviously for a long time I didn’t think about it as a kid but when I got older I started thinking he might be gay.There’s also this guy “John.” I don’t know him that well but like he’s visited us 1-2 times a year over the years even though we live on the opposite coast. We’ll usually hang out all three of us like at a movie or my uncle will get tickets for something, but he and John will spend time together too. There’s just this weird vibe between them. Sometimes I don’t know why they’re friends because they don’t like laugh or talk about the good old days with each other, my uncle is kind of uptight around him. They just seem to talk alone a lot.I’ve also noticed that when we see my grandparents my uncle will never be like “oh my friend John is spending the weekend with us.” And this is really embarrassing but John does this thing where he sends out a little email newsletter to my grandparents and older relatives with like pictures and updates, but I’ve noticed John is never mentioned there either.The other day I had his phone for something and I noticed a ton of messages between him and John, I didn’t see anything but the last few texts but just noticed the conversation was really large. But then he saw me looking and took his phone back and didn’t say anything. I knew he knew I’d seen it so I said something like “Oh it’s cool that you talk, how do you know each other again” and he gave me a vague answer. And I’ve been thinking about it since that happened and realized I don’t even know that much about John. I think he might have a daughter and he’s like showed me some of his hobbies but I don’t know anything about like his life or how he knows my uncle. And like it's weird for him to fly 3k miles multiple times per year to visit in-person, right?Would it be weird to say something to my uncle? I feel bad and even though we live in a liberal area, our family is semi-religious with lots of older relatives. I feel like I want him to know that I support him specifically. Because sometimes people say they’re fine with LGBTQ people but then they don’t really mean it. And I know it’s his choice but it also kind of bugs me that he doesn’t feel like he can share his own life with me, I’m 17 not 7.TL;DR: I think my uncle might be gay. Should I talk to him about it?147 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
i4nbdc,3.0kPosted by1 year agoArchivedComments are lockedMy (28F) boyfriend (32M) told me a “white lie” for almost 3 years and I’m not sure if it‘s a red flag
              
            RelationshipsTL;DR: my boyfriend of almost 3 years told me a series of “white lies” that to me, seem more serious. Can’t tell if I’m overreacting or if this is actually indicative of a bigger problem.I’ll try to make this as short as possible but it’s going to be long as hell because there is so much lying going on. My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years, living together for 2. We have a pretty good relationship, obviously with ups and downs but we make it work and are happy.A little background on me/my boyfriend for context:I come from a single-parent home. My father was absent. My mother was/is by no means perfect, but she did her best with what she had. We were poor. Life was never easy for us but we had each other. Since I was pretty young, I’ve wanted to pay her back someday. I’ve worked incredibly hard to be able to do so. I help her financially as much as I can and regularly pay her bills/send her cash. I’m also her only living child now as my brother passed away 5 years ago which basically left me to help her. I don’t care, I love my mother, and the right thing to do is to help her when she needs it. But is is stressful.This is relevant because my boyfriend described coming from a somewhat similar past, and it is something we have bonded over. Having the mutual experiences seemed to bring us closer. He told me he also helped his parents financially, and we would often vent to each other about the stress it brings. I am not one to confide in many people, so having someone who I felt like actually understood me, was meaningful to me.So here is where the lies come in and I need someone to either tell me I’m not crazy and this is fucked up, or that I am crazy and this isn’t a huge deal. I’m fine with either.When we met, my boyfriend lived in a condo in a pretty swanky part of the city (I live in the US northeast). He told me he owned that apartment/condo. I found this to be interesting/odd because he was 28 at the time and I know this property is upwards of $650,000 on the low end and he was in an entry-level job for only like 2 yrs so the numbers just didn’t really add up. Whatever, maybe he’s good at saving?But then, since living together, I never once saw a piece of mail for a mortgage payment, electric bill, taxes, nothing. Not for 2 whole years. Very odd.Also, when we started living together, he didn’t have his room rented out in the former apartment yet so he was still responsible for that portion of the rent. He would send a Venmo payment to his mother on the first of every month for his portion. I don’t own property, but I can’t think of a scenario where I would Venmo my mother to pay the mortgage on a property I supposedly own. Getting more odd.He would then go to his parents house for an afternoon and come back really upset. Usually when I would ask why, it was because they were having financial problems and he needed to help them out. I totally understood this and supported him. He literally has cried on my shoulder about this many times.He tried to start a company years back and ended up getting into debt somehow. He told me this debt was $17,000 and that he paid it off. I’m confused because I met him only 2-3 years after the supposed debt accrued/company dissolved and it was already paid off? He told me when he moved back home after the business failed, he was $17k in debt and living at his parents house working at a minimum wage job. How someone with a minimum wage job pays off that much debt in 3 years, I’ll never know!We got into a fight a few weeks ago and I finally had enough and confronted him about these things. Long story short - he doesn’t help his parents, they actually pay his phone bill, and this was all a lie. He doesn’t own that apartment, he didn’t pay off that debt from his company (he initially told me his parents helped pay it off and then like 3 mins later “came clean” and said that his business partner paid it off so I have literally no idea what the truth is there) and if anything, in my eyes, his parents are the ones who are financially supporting him.So now, I’m dating a 31 yr old man who doesn’t pay his own phone bill, was lying to me and/or completely fabricating aspects of his life for 3 years, and then when confronted about it, continued to make up lies and then came clean about them 5 mins later. I’m obviously concerned that he could lie for this long, about fundamentally important things like our values, and so on.I sincerely thought I would marry this man, he seemed to understand me like no one else and to be a truly caring and genuine person. Now I’m having a hard time rationalizing actually planning a life around someone who would not only lie about their background and family etc. but also financial aspects. Aside from that, I now can’t tell what is the truth and what is a lie. I’ve also noticed other things he has lied about, called him out on it and he has denied it outright to my face. I see this as a form of gaslighting as I KNOW I’m not wrong but he is trying to convince me otherwise.Am I overreacting? Is this a white lie that went haywire? Or is this actually a series of complete and utter bullshit used to manipulate me? And also, is it insane for me to actually consider a life with this man? Any advice is appreciated.255 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
i7wkqu,2.9kPosted by1 year agoArchivedComments are lockedI (30F) caught my husband (31M) in an affair and I don’t know how to move on.
              
            InfidelityI’ve suspected things had been going on for a while, but kept brushing it off—I thought he would never do that to me. Since around April, he’s been refusing my attempts to have sex most of the time, sitting differently on the couch to where he’s facing away from me... little things.It’s with one of our good friends. She came to my house a few weeks ago. She’s texted me. She’s pretended to be there for me.I found out because I rolled over and they were having a Snapchat conversation. She said she wished she could be there to hold him and he summarized that I tried to seduce him last night and mocked it. I confronted him and he admitted it. He said that it was because quarantine was stressful. He does not want to work things out. He thinks of me “only as a friend in his heart.”When I told her husband, he confronted her and apparently they actually kissed back in February. I think at that moment, I was never going to be enough for him.We used to be so so so happy. The week before they kissed, we celebrated Valentine’s Day together. He bought us a nice bottle of wine for our anniversary. We had fun, we were perfect.I don’t know where to go from here. We’ve been married only about a year. I feel like he took so much from me and doesn’t even want to go to therapy or work this out. I don’t want to leave my house but everywhere in it I see him. He chose her. I’ve been cheated in every relationship I’ve ever been in. He was supposed to be my forever.I don’t know what to do. I’ve made therapy appointments but I was also laid off last month, so I have too much free time to analyze every single moment where he might have been lying to me or where I made myself pathetic trying to cling to him.How do I start to get through this?TLDR; My husband had an affair and does not want to try to work out our marriage. I feel like I’m drowning and don’t know how to start moving on.172 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
kz6fpy,2.9kPosted by9 months agoArchivedHow to deal with my dad (50/M) moving his GF (48/F) in as a 16/F teenager?
              
            Non-RomanticMy dad recently moved his partner in without asking me or my siblings if it was ok.This has created a lot of awkwardness for us, and my 2 younger siblings keep telling me they are uncomfortable living with her because it’s like having a stranger in our house. I feel the same way. I don’t really know how to cope so I’ve just not really talked to her beyond saying hi and good night and how was your day to her.Recently, my dad has asked me why I haven’t talked to her more and I told him that I’m not that outgoing or talkative with strangers. He said that she wasn’t a stranger and I said she felt like one. I asked why it wasn’t ok for me to just coexist with her in the house and to just only exchange small pleasantries, and he got angry at me and said I needed to make her feel welcome.I just don’t know how. She seems nice, but I’ve been feeling depressed about not seeing my friends, and so I’m tired and run-down a lot. I have a bad relationship with my mom, too, so I’m wary of older women and women who are in a position to be maternal.Tl;dr: I’m looking for advice on how to deal with my dad’s girlfriend moving in.345 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
i1chj5,2.9kPosted by1 year agoArchived[UPDATE] Me [23 F] with my bf [21 M] of 8 months, regarding living with my brother [20 M]
              
            RelationshipsOriginal post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34fd9v/me_23_f_with_my_bf_21_m_of_8_months_regarding/Hey all! Reddit emailed me about verifying this account, which I completely forgot even existed, so I checked it out and went back and read my post from 5 years ago. I read through the comments again, and I figured maybe it'd be worth posting an update since honestly, I have no idea how I was defending this person at the time...Pretty much, I made that post about my boyfriend thinking it was "very weird" that I lived with my brother at a point where my boyfriend and I had been dating for a few months shy of a year. One month after I made that post, my brother ended up moving out anyway, and my boyfriend and I moved to another apartment (all planned, and just a matter of the lease ending), so the situation had mostly resolved itself.However, LET ME TELL YOU, holy shit, I wish I would have taken the advice given to me in the post, and I cringed reading through this 5-year-old post because a lot of the comments were so true, and I should have just left. I put up with his shit for a total of 4 years before he broke up with me ("for good" - we actually broke up probably 10-12 different times that lasted anywhere from a few hours to a couple of weeks).The entire time, he was definitely jealous of my brother. Pretty much, he ended up admitting that my brother was a guy who commanded a room, people always looking to him (like, he's sort of a "leader" in his friend group), and making people laugh. That was the type of person my (now ex-) boyfriend wanted to be, so he hated that my brother was that. In fits of rage, even in a completely unrelated argument, he would randomly be like "I bet you've fucked your brother!" So much shit coming from him, but I think that the combination of he and I in a relationship together was just incredibly toxic and made it so hard for me to be able to think about things rationally.There was a comment in my original post about someone wishing I could see the situation from the outside, and looking back at that post, I feel like I finally am, and it's just cringeworthy. Someone had PM'd me a list of signs of an abusive relationship, and looking back, he definitely checks off most of those. I had said that he rarely lies to me, but in retrospect, our relationship was FULL of lies - some major ones that I recall from before I made that post, so I'm not sure if I was lying to myself then or what.I'm in a much better place now, and have had a new boyfriend for about 2 years. I think the takeaway here, and why I wanted to post an update is for people perhaps in a similar situation (regardless of what it might be about) to consider. If your SO is absolutely ridiculous when it comes to something, don't expect it to be okay just because you can maybe avoid that topic in the future. It's possible that it will still come up, and it's very likely that this isn't a red flag to ignore just because it's easy to ignore. It's still a raging red flag, and has a lot of implications for your relationship in the future.tl;dr: Stayed with boyfriend of < 1 year at the time for about 4 years. He was super jealous of my brother and thought living with him was very weird. Post-breakup, I finally have clarity and he was ridiculous.71 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
ndbv44,2.8kPosted by5 months agoMy (24M) fiancé (24F) insists that we take care of her autistic younger brother. (21M) (5yrs)
              
            RelationshipsMy fiancé and I have talked about this a few times, and it always ends with her angry and crying. I love her so much but I cannot get past this point. Here’s the issue:She has a younger brother I’ve known about since we’ve dated in college. He’s a very low functioning autistic, to the extent that he will need full-time supervision and care for the rest of his adult life. He’s a sweetheart and a great kid, and he and my fiancé are about as close as siblings can get.We want kids, but whenever we get on the topic she brings up her brother and talks about how “you won’t even notice he’s there” and that “he can really take care of himself, he just needs some supervision is all.” I’ve taken a lot of time to consider it, and as much as I like her brother, I’m not marrying her for her family.She wants us to take care of him alongside our children, to live with us as soon as I’m done with Med school until presumably we die.I’ve told her I love her brother, but I don’t want him to live with us and our kids, if we choose to have them. Her parents are two wonderful people, and I feel they are much more equipped to take care of him like they have the last 21 years.My position is that he will be happier and better taken care of with his parents, and that it is their responsibility to do so. As far as I’m aware they’re planning on doing this anyway, but every time my fiancé and I have this conversation it ends with tears.TL;DR - My fiancé wants us to take care of her autistic younger brother, I don’t think it would be best for him or us. We are not as well equipped as her parents to do so.406 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
nmy29p,2.8kPosted by5 months ago2I (30F) live in a fantasy world (married to 30M)
              
            RelationshipsI have always had an active imagination and a rich fantasy life. It helps that I like to write and I'm able to bring a lot of that to my stories. But I also have a rich fantasy life that I keep to myself as sort of an escape from reality. My therapist wants me to unpack this a little and distance myself from it. And I guess I'm looking for a little perspective.For background, I've been married for 5 years and together 12. My husband is a good man, kind and loving. We have one child (4F). We both work full time, and we have dates and time together. In many ways I'm satisfied. But at the core, my husband and I are different people. He is not passionate and not interested in the same things I am for the most part. I also have little interest in his hobbies. So we both have inner lives that are separate from the other.I'll make up stories to get myself through the day. Like I'll see a stranger at the library and I imagine a meeting of the minds relationship with this complete stranger. Or I'll leave home at night and go for drives and listen to romantic songs and put myself in the lyrics. I thumb through travel websites and imagine entire lives in those places. My therapist has been gently telling me that this might be unhealthy behavior, and that I should give more thought to being present in the world. Anyone else dealing with a similar dilemma? Any advice?tl;dr: Married woman with stable married life, no real issues except imagination.401 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
kjm5pf,2.7kPosted by10 months agoArchived3I've [f/29] started dating someone far more attractive [m/31], help?
              
            DatingWe've been dating for 3 weeks. Too early to know exactly where it's going, but so far he's been openly enthusiastic. I haven't felt this nervous in years! Obviously I know he's not perfect and I'm keeping an eye on that side of things too, as it's easy to get swept away.He's very attractive, well spoken, well-read, open about his interest but not over doing it. Fantastic kisser. We're in the same industry and have similar life plans. Lots in common as far as interests. Hell, even similar ugly-duckling stories. He's been super respectful anytime I mention a boundary of sorts. I have a few as my last long-term relationship was quite abusive. Luckily my ex has been out of my life for 2 years. FWIW - I haven't mentioned my ex yet, just vague things like "oh do you mind not surprising me from behind? I'm a bit jumpy." This isn't my first time dating since my ex and I have plenty of  (positive!) dating experiences from before him too. I really shouldn't feel so... Almost starstruck.I just feel like a teenager again. Half the time I don't know what to say I'm so flustered. How do I get my nervousness under control and just enjoy the moment? If this doesn't work out I'll be fine - I'm not so worried about my heart so much as trying to act like myself and less struck on dates!TL;DR: Met an awesome guy. Obviously trying to keep my head, but how to I stop losing my thoughts and wit while we're talking?Edit: Wow I was not expecting so many responses! Thanks all - it's great hearing stories of folks in similar situations, as well as some tips and tricks I can use to stay appropriately excited. Really appreciate the kindness shown!Edit 2: I should have phrased it like I'm not used to being so attracted to someone. I'm quite confident in myself and his interest! But that doesn't help me when he does something very goofy and charming and I'm a bit lost in how attractive he is. The limerence is strong haha. All the same the answers have been super lovely and encouraging!183 commentssharesavehidereport95% Upvoted
m5uznm,2.7kPosted by7 months agoArchivedComments are locked4414my (14m) family is falling apart
              
            Personal issuesUp until about March 2020, my family was fine, my parents were divorced on very good terms (had been for 9 years) But right as the covid restriction began, my dad pretty much began losing it. In turn, this really screwed up my 18 year old brother, who turned to drinking. This is how things were for a while, until about august, when my brother got a dui. Wrecking a car my dad had just bought him. And my dad isn't rich by any means. He's unemployed, with virtually no money. At this point my dad went virtually insane. Then, my dog, and cat died. Not exactly helping. Then, in december my dad finally decided to go to an impatient facility, he came out two weeks later, feeling good. For about a week. He went back a month later. Same deal, felt good a week, went back. And now we're here. He came out, same thing. But now, he's totally estranged. He told my mom "I loathe you, fuck you." and won't give her back the $6000 he owes her. So my mom is also financially fucked up now. My brother is in constant conflict with my mom, and my mom is crying almost everyday. I just don't know what to do, I'm mind bogglingly stressed everyday and can't focus on anything.tl;dr: family coming apart, dad resents mom for no reason, 18 yo brother picking up drinking132 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted

lnciku,2.6kPosted by8 months agoArchivedMarried friend (26F) can’t stop talking about my (27F) ex boyfriend
              
            Non-RomanticUpdate: thank you all so much such amazing support and helping me see through things! I sent her a message saying how uncomfortable last night was for me, that it was not right to rub her friendship with him on my face and how it felt like she valued her relationship with my ex more than our friendship. I told her I can’t dictate who she can be friends with but that I cannot be friends with someone who’s a close friend of that one person who messed me up mentally and emotionally. I wished her the best and blocked her from everywhere.I have known her since we were in grade 4. We lived in the same neighbourhood and went to the same school. We were good friends till high school and eventually drifted apart. My best friend and she used to go to the same college and used to tell how she was clingy with a guy even though she had a boyfriend who went to a different college. I kept away from her and thought I would never be in touch with her but we were friends on Facebook. I finished college and moved to a different country when I learned her father had passed away. I felt really bad and reached out to her. She mentioned she was also moving to the country and we decided to meet up. My boyfriend and I met her for lunch and eventually my boyfriend and her husband became friends. I broke up with my boyfriend and she said how she would have gone after my ex if only she wasn’t married because he’s really cute. I told her what he did to me but it made no difference to her. She had plans of meeting my ex out for dinner and invited me out too. I stopped hanging out with her after that. She kept messaging me to meet quite a few times and I kept making excuses. I finally cave in and planned a dinner with her for today, but she wouldn’t stop talking about my ex. Telling how he is one of her close friends and how they keep sending each other snapchats (like it was a big deal for her). It felt really annoying I cut the dinner short and headed home. I don’t want to be friends with her anymore. How should I tell her that I don’t want to be friends with her without hurting her feelings? How do I stay away from her?Tldr: married friend became close friend of my ex after we broke up and keeps talking about him every time we meet.193 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
i4bc5g,2.6kPosted by1 year agoArchivedI think I am ignoring the fact that my fiancé is done with our relationship.
              
            RelationshipsI think my relationship might be over?I (27f) have been with my fiancé (27m) for about 4 years. We were long distance for 2. We’ve definitely had our ups and our downs. At some points, it was very rough, but we pushed through.Lately, I’ve been realizing that I think he (and maybe myself) have been done. He isn’t romantic with me, doesn’t hold my hand when we go out, and when I tried initiating date nights, he would tell me he forgot about them. At these “date nights” we’re the only couple not looking at each other. We don’t kiss a little here and there. We eat and go home. I tried to have a romantic convo to light the spark by saying things I admired about him. When I asked him what he admires about me, his response was “Nah, I’m not answering that. You’re just trying to be needy or something.” Then changed the subject.He texts me less when he’s at work saying he’s had a crazy day and sometimes forgets to respond or text me.We haven’t really had sex or cuddled in about 2 or 3 weeks.He isn’t interested at all in my day or what I’m up to. There’s no love or compassion or anything. He mostly says he’s just super stressed and anxious from work.Reddit, is it over or is he really stressed with work like he claims?TLDR: I think my relationship may be over. There’s no spark and no initiative to make it better. Should I leave him? I think that may be what he’s trying to do and I’m just too ignorant to believe it.218 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted

She went from being someone that I absolutely hated and could barely work with to just my least favorite person in the office, but no more than that.But then today, I was informed by one of the other bosses that she no longer works for our firm!

            UpdatesOriginal:  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/iils7b/i_22m_have_always_bottled_up_my_feelings_but_my/Hi! So, I know it hasn't been long since I posted on here, but a LOT has changed in a such a short amount of time, and I believe this post warrants its own update. Thank you to everyone on this and multiple other subreddits for their kindness and good advice. You helped me realize what I needed to do to get all these years of emotional turmoil out of my system while still maintaining my relationship with my GF.(TL;DR at the bottom)My original plan with Katie was to go on a break (but not break up) while she went out of town with her family for a week. She'd be healing from the loss of her mother, and I'd be looking into better means of handling my emotions than just bottling them up.Well, I couldn't wait a week to resolve this. Since that night, this whole ordeal had been consuming my every thought, to the point where I thought I was gonna puke from the tension. I was afraid of both losing Katie, and of facing my feelings. I've had these mental barriers up for so long that the idea of them coming down scared me. My mind kept switching between being stoic, and being ready to burst in anger or sadness. I knew I had to let myself feel, but I didn't want to because of how much it hurt, but I couldn't just shake it off like I'd always done. I was scared, alone, and ready to burst.Later that day, I got a text from Katie asking if I could come over. She wanted to give me something before she left on her trip tomorrow. I headed for my car without a second thought. I decided that if I couldn't handle my emotions by myself, I'd do it with the one person I felt comfortable showing them with.Once at her apartment, I did my best to stay calm in front of Katie, but I was already a mess. I was stammering every other sentence, dropping things, my voice and body trembling. It was obvious I was about to explode. Then, Katie showed me her phone. She said her dad had video recorded her mom's funeral, and asked if I'd like a copy to keep. I said yes, and Katie sent me a link to it on her DropBox, and I started watching it with her.Now, I was there at the actual funeral. The part that made me so close to crying before was when the preacher and family eulogies described Katie's mom: a nurturing, loving figure you could always turn to when you needed it. Someone ready with warm hugs, a shoulder to cry on, a sense of security knowing you were taken care of. Basically, everything I DIDN'T have from my single father. Every other time I've felt the tears coming on, I'd hold them back like a reflex. This time, though, instead of fighting my emotions, I fought the reflex. I let the tears pool in my eyes, and fought hard to keep my hands away from my face. I could really feel it now; all the years of anger, sadness, pain, and other negativity I'd kept bottled up inside were reaching the surface.That did it. After all these years of being so afraid to, I started crying. It wasn't straight-up bawling; it was actually a bit forced at first. I wanted the tears to flow, but some part of me was screaming, "No, stop it! Shame on you! This isn't appropriate for a man!"Then, Katie gave me a hug, gently rubbing my back, saying things like "It's ok," or "Just let it all out," or "you don't have to keep being strong for me." At one point, she said, "My mom always made me feel safe whenever I was sad. Now I wanna do the same for you." That REALLY did it for me. I bawled my eyes out like someone just put all of Niagara Falls into my tear ducts. Katie just kept hugging me, and even kissed my head at one point. At first, I HATED how I was feeling; reliving all the fear, sadness, and hatred for everything my father put me through. This was more painful than any physical injury I'd ever sustained in my life. After a while, though, I realized I was finally getting the kind of love and support I wanted so badly as a kid. I didn't know Katie's mom very well, and my own mom even less, but based on how everyone described her, Katie was doing an AMAZING job of living through her mom's legacy of love and kindness. For the first time in ages, I felt like my feelings mattered.For the next 3 or so hours, I just kept crying and crying. Of course, Katie couldn't sit there hugging me the whole time, but she did her best to keep me comfortable as I cried out 7 years worth of tears. She brought me tissues, water, gentle back rubs, and more hugs when she could, letting me know I could "take all the time you needed." She's such a trooper. Not even my own father had this kind of patience for me.When I was finally done, Katie offered to have me spent the night with her. I was too tired, puffy-eyed, and had too bad a headache to drive safely home, so I graciously accepted. She later ordered my favorite takeout for dinner, and we finished the night with Stranger Things, and a make-out session. Katie's definitely a keeper.Katie's out of town now, but I'm still looking into effective techniques and methods for letting myself feel and cry again (if I have to.) I know all my problems didn't just disappear in one night, so I'll be seeing counseling regularly once my community college reopens in a few weeks. Hopefully, Katie will be feeling well enough from her loss to come back to class with me, too.TY for listening. :)TL;DR: After years of bottling up my feelings, I finally let myself cry (with my GF's help,) and I feel MUCH better about it.Edit: For those of you concerned that I'll start treating Katie like my mother or therapist, don't worry, I'm determined to prevent that from being the case. I can't afford therapy ATM, so I'll be seeing a counselor once my community college reopens later in September. I've also been looking into additional resources, like free online counseling.Also, TYVM for all your kind words, advice, and awards! I didn't expect this post to blow up like this!119 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
jq4p0f,2.4kPosted by11 months agoArchived22My (F 46) sons (21) girlfriend (20) got me something I know she can't afford and I worry about her
              
            Non-RomanticMy son and his girlfriend have been dating for over two years now. They go to the same college. She moved in with him in the midst of quarantine but eventually went home. Her parents are horrible and practically kicked her out in the middle of the night. My son had to pull some strings to even get her a flight.For her birthday, I bought her a necklace. It was before quarantine so I bought it overseas. It made me think of her. I care for her and I wanted too. It was pricy but I can afford it. I remember her face when I gave it to her. She looked terrified like I pulled a gun on her. She kept looking at it then at me. She stuttered so much before thanking me. Throughout our stay, I noticed her watching me several times. My son told me later that she is scared of me. After prying, I learned how bad her family actually is.For my birthday, she got me an expensive necklace. I know the brand and there's no way she could afford it. She looked at me so scared and just asked if I liked it. I told her I did. She keeps watching me.Now, I worry about where she got the money. Her classes are all remote this semester. She can't decide whether she wants to be with my son or her family. She loves her younger siblings and has all but raised them. Then, her parents kick her out or threaten her.I worry so much about her at home. If she has money to take care of herself and her little siblings. I feel like she got me the necklace to pay me back but she did not need too. I feel so guiltyWould I be a horrible person if I gave her a some money no questions asked? Or if I got her and her siblings expensive gifts she could sell or gift cards. I don't know if she would. She is not the type to ask for help. I remember my son on the phone for hours trying to find a hotel for her to stay at in the midst of quarantine after what her parents did. I want to make her a bank account or trust fund. I don't know how to do it. I also don't want to embarrass or cause her to fear me. My son says she looks up to me and wants to make me happy. I feel so guilty. I never should have gotten her that necklace when she has trouble feeding and clothing herself and the little ones.tldr I got my son's girlfriend an expensive necklace. She got me a similar one but I worry about how she can afford it and take of herself and little siblings120 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
niaytx,2.4kPosted by5 months ago6My [26m]'s girlfriend [24f] wants to break up because of my disability
              
            [new]Hi all, honestly I know how this is probably going to go but I wanted to make this post to get other people's opinions and maybe get some help so I know what I can personally do better to avoid something similar in the future.Obligatory I'm on mobile so please be lenient.I've got cerebral palsy that affects both my legs and one arm. That's my official diagnosis but what you really see is I walk with a limp. I'm a software developer so job wise, I don't have any issues. I knew when I was a kid that using my brain is the best way for me to survive on my own without relying on other people. I haven't had the chance to get my driver's license but according to therapists and doctors that shouldn't be an issue. That's the background about me.My girlfriend and I have been together for a year. We met back in April 2020 of last year and we decided to get together in May 2020. I told her about my disability before then but she wanted to try and make it work. We video call on discord every day almost always when we're awake and recently we've been going on dates. She's more then happy to lend me an arm and she notices things about me that even I miss myself. Outside of my family she's the most loving and caring person I know and she's my motivation to do better and improve myself. Honestly, I never thought I could find someone I trusted enough to share my more negative thoughts and problems. I always tried to seem happy so I don't worry others. The emotional support she gives me is really irreplaceable.The problem is is scared that, in the future she will have to take care of me or most of the work will fall onto her. To make matters worse her mom has been telling her for the past few weeks to break up with me because she can find better and she doesn't want her to have the burden of caring for me. She's also really afraid that I will get arthritis early due to my cerebral palsy and if that happens, a lot is going to be on her.I've tried doing things like stretches and exercises to maintain and improve my muscle tone but she is still afraid I'll get worse.Reddit, please help. I'm an introvert I don't know a lot of people and honestly I don't even know the options I've got to look at. I want to prove that I can be independent and that if things do go wrong, it won't just be on her. I'm in Ontario Canada. Are there things I can look into and do to assist with my disability or things I can look into so if things do go wrong, I won't be a burden on her?Please Reddit, I'm at the end of my wits. I've never really hated my disability but I've always kept myself going by being tempering my expectations and thinking, "my disability is going to make it really hard to find someone" and she's the first person to make me feel like "ya, it doesn't matter". I want to do anything to show her that I won't hold her back in the future but I'm out of ideas. Is there anything I can do?I don't want to worry anyone I'm with with these issues but I'm at the end of my wits. Please Reddit, I need ideas. I don't even know if my relationship is lost but I don't want this to happen again and I want to know what I can do myself so I can reassure my partner so they know I won't hold them back in the future.Has anyone had similar experiences? Maybe there are resources that I can tap into? I don't know if there are things I can look into to better plan my future so it's not a concern for my partner. I really need help.The worst part is, I've always thought my disability doesn't matter. But with all of this happening it's really hard to convince myself otherwise.TL;DR I've got a permanent disability and I don't know how to reassure my girlfriend that I can handle myself in the future.332 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
o4zzmz,2.4kPosted by4 months ago23(UPDATE) My (36M) family is upset I'm 'prioritizing' my BIL over my niece after my sister (27F) cheated.
              
            UpdatesLink to original postFirstly, thank you everyone for your comments, messages, insights and support. It really helped me strengthen my resolve and find solace in what I was doing. I'll address a few concerns/questions that popped up before my mini-update.Yes, Bill knows Jane is his. When Tom got his paternity test done, he and Bill had him go separately to be tested.Why am I letting Tom stay with me? Well..he was family for years and for me, you don't just chuck family onto the streets except for extreme situations. Divorce takes a year in my state and Tom is opting to stay to make sure it can all be handled quickly and smoothly to get it finalized as soon as possible. That said, he plans on moving back to his homestate after that so I am letting him stay with me so he can save money for his move and moving expenses. Otherwise, the only places he could afford on his own require 6 and 12 month leases.Supporting Tom and Bill may result in my sister and I having little to no contact. True, it may, and that'll be our crosses to bear but I can't find it in me to ignore others needing help just to satiate her and excuse her behavior. I still love my sister, whatever my feelings or opinions of what she did or is doing have no place in this, nor is it really the time for me to go expressing them to her. Bill's lawyer says its very likely Bill will wind up with a custody arrangement and he has assured me that if things do go south with my sister that she won't let me see my niece, I'd always be welcome to visit them to see her during his time with her.Now for the update..its not a huge one but rather surprising. My sister is still being cranky and doubling down, doing all she can to guilt Tom into reconciling and adamant about Bill not being involved because 'she has a husband that just needs to realize they can work through this, Tom is Jane's dad and Bill is not needed'. So..meh there. Last week I went on a fishing trip with both Tom and Bill for the three of us to just relax and forget all this nonsense for a bit. Once we got back my mother showed up to try talking to me about why I am doing any of this.Surprisingly, we had a decent talk after some heated tension. I wound up showing her the post and while she wasn't happy I was airing our laundry, it helped a bit. Ultimately I was able to get it through to her that given the circumstances and the high probability Bill is going to be a presence in Jane's life from here on out, the best thing for Jane would be if our family and Bill could at least co-exist. I asked her how she would feel if her granddaughter was constantly having to choose who to spend time with for birthdays, graduation, prom pictures, etc, or gods forbid, we all put her in a position that she would have to lie to everyone about what she wanted just to not hurt feelings. It took a while but that seemed to at least get through to her a bit. She's still not happy about the whole situation, but she did agree to a dinner in a public place to meet Bill and some of his family and I'm happy to say that that wound up going off really well and Bill's mother had a good heart to heart with her. So, some progress. Thanks again everyone for the support.TLDR: My sister is still trying to pressure my BIL into reconciling and mad at me for supporting BIL and her daughter's father, but my mother is at least making some progress towards accepting my niece's biological father.218 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
iyx7ew,2.2kPosted by1 year agoArchivedHow do I tell my best friend (both F20s) that I want to stop exchanging Christmas presents?
              
            Non-RomanticThrowaway account. TL;DR at end.My best friend is a really great gift-giver. I know that she plans gifts really far in advance and always dedicates so much time & thought into them, and I am so grateful for every gift I have ever received because I know how special they are. She'll often take something small I said from years back and make a really meaningful thing out it, and I know she enjoys gift giving and it is clearly one of primary ways she communicates her love for me and others.I just can't keep up. I've never been a really good gift-giver. I often really struggle with forming ideas for upcoming celebrations, and until I'm really under the pump, I come up empty handed until I find something just alright or I repeat a similar schtick of "reasons why I value you" presents.This just means that I feel so much stress every time I have to celebrate her birthday & Christmas, especially because I would have received something completely out of this world. I really just feel like my gifts pale in comparison. It's getting to this stage where we've been exchanging presents for 8 years and I'm honestly just starting to feel like I'm running out of steam to keep up and continue thinking of other ideas. It is also hard because I'm neither here nor there when it comes to receiving gifts. I can recognise the hard work and love, but I don't need to receive gifts to know that I'm loved, and so I worry that I don't reciprocate my love well enough because my presents never feel at her level.I want to express to her my gratitude for her gifts but ask that we just stick to one a year, on birthdays, because Christmas and the occasional Valentines' Day is too much for me. I have been able to move away from gift-giving with other friends by just casually mentioning it or just mutually ceasing present exchanges, and we now opt for spending time with each other - something I love. I just don't know if this would be really insensitive or soul-crushing because it's not about her or how good of a friend she is, but really about my insecurity and my differing ways of communicating love.I know I've got to have the conversation, but does anyone have any tips or advice for how I could communicate this in a tactful and non-hurtful way?TL;DR: my best friend is a great gift-giver and expresses her love through that, but I don't and so I feel my gifts are incomparable. I want to only exchange presents once a year and opt to spend time with her for other celebrations but don't know how to deliver this in a sensitive and thoughtful way.Edit: thank you all so much! I'm trying to get around to reading all the comments but I just want to say that I appreciate everyone's perspectives and input. It's really been helpful for me to consider different ways of having the conversation and problem-solving our way to a more mutually agreeable situation.Also, yes, she's definitely the Leslie Knope in this instance. Maybe I could suggest "Knope-resents 2020" HAHAHA please laugh327 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
o374g6,2.3kPosted byu/[deleted]4 months agoMy (29f) husband (39m) doesn't get that meeting my needs and running errands isn't self care for Moms.
              
            [new]My husband seems to think that stuff like having a quick shower after going without for 5 days, running into the grocery store by myself for 25 minutes, or getting a quick basic haircut after 2 years of not getting it done, or simply any time where he is watching the kids all count towards my self care "me time"...I kind of think that this stuff just counts as maintaining basic hygiene and doing chores/errands.My husband goes out for a few drinks 2-4 times a month. So tonight he's going out and I said I was jealous, it sounds nice to go out a have a few drinks without the kids. I don't really get to do stuff like that for me.He said that I am going to a Drs appointment tomorrow and that's for me, it's something I wanted to do. I told him a DRs appointment isn't the same as going out for drinks, it's not enjoyable or stress relieving. He just kinda brushed it off. I'm still so mad that he thinks those 2 things are at all equal.I just don't know how to get it through his head that I need actual time for stress relief. He always acts like if I want to go out for a coffee or have a glass of wine and have a nice bath or something that I'm taking extra time on top of all the "me time" he thinks I'm already getting. Like I am unfairly burdening him with watching the kids when he already works 8hrs a day.He just was on 3.5 months of parental leave and said it's so stressful watching the kids 24/7 and would give me breaks a lot. I thought he finally understood what it's like. How do I make him get it? Taking time for myself isn't nice when I know I'll just get lectured on how the kids were screaming and it was so hard on him the whole time.TL:DR My husband thinks any time he is watching the kids is self care, stress relief time for me. How do I get him to understand it's not?349 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
n73ed6,2.1kPosted by5 months agoMy (28F) uncle (49M) is fixated on the idea of my husband (28M) having a mistress and getting him to say he would leave me if his mistress was pregnant.
              
            [new]My cousin is pregnant with a married man’s baby. It’s been a huge scandal in our family, but my uncle has been doing his hardest to convince everyone that my cousin is the real victim in this situation. He thinks that the married man, who has small children with his wife, should abandon them and take care of my cousin and their baby instead.For some unexplainable reason, he has latched onto my husband to try and push this narrative that the married man has more obligation to his mistress than his wife. At first, my uncle coaxed my husband into agreeing by not giving him the whole story. I was furious and exploded at him which made my cousin cry.Now, my uncle is obsessed with the idea of my husband having a mistress.In 2019, we took a family vacation with my extended family. During that vacation, my husband got a lot of female attention. This isn’t unusual for him; he has always got a lot of attention, so he’s used to it. There was this one particular girl though, that brazenly invited my husband to her room in front of my uncles/cousins. My uncle keeps bringing it up and mentioning how my husband must get a lot of invites like that and travelling alone must get lonely at times. Pre-COVID my husband used to travel a lot and sometimes for long stretches.He also has outright said that my husband is in the perfect position to have several mistresses and he doubts he would ever get caught. He has asked him if he has a second family in a different country and has “jokingly” suggested he leave if his other “wife” is better looking than me.One of the worst parts is that two of my male cousins have asked my husband if they can have the numbers of anyone he is bored with because they believe he is fooling around because my uncle is going on about it with so much confidence so often.I’m honestly at my breaking point here. My husband has outright told my uncle that what he is saying is inappropriate, but my uncle tries to act like it’s all one big joke. I can’t go no contact with my uncle because my elderly grandparents live with him and he won’t let me see them if I do.What are my other options here? How can I make him stop?TL;DR – My cousin is pregnant with a married man’s baby. Now my uncle is obsessed with implying my husband is having an affair and that if he gets his mistress pregnant, he should leave me for her.299 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
mumlol,2.0kPosted by6 months ago22My [20M] girlfriend [20F] hates venting to me because she feels like a burden and she would rather go elsewhere, what can we do?
              
            RelationshipsMy gf of one year dislikes venting to me. Her reasoning is that she is aware of my feelings and problems and so by venting to me, she feels like a burden and that she’s adding to my problems with her problems/feelings. She would rather vent to other people since she doesn’t know what they’re going through and so doesn’t feel like a burden venting to them. I genuinely love when she vents to me but no matter how much I try and reassure her, the feelings are hard to shake. It hurts because I’m there for her all the time and want her to use me and talk to me, she’s the person I care about most in this world, but when she goes elsewhere I feel entirely useless. How can I help her in general with her feelings and how can we change this mindset together? Any help is appreciated. Thank you so much for reading.tl;dr—my gf doesn’t like venting to me because she feels like a burden since she knows of my personal problems.151 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
ktohyr,2.0kPosted by9 months agoArchived6My “dad” shows just how worthless he is. How do I deal with this new anger?
              
            Personal issuesMy biological father is leaving his mother (my grandma, 70) with the only option of selling her house.The guy mentioned above turned to drugs not long after I was born. My grandma, his mom, has given him a tremendous amount of help in so many ways to help him get his life together. I could make a long list of things she did, but that would make this post far too long. She is an ANGEL. I never knew him since my my mother kept me away from him while he was using. He did not get clean until I was around 6. Rarely payed child support. After getting clean he never made the effort to re-enter my life. Even though after getting clean, he never lived more than 10 minutes away at his mothers house (my grandma). He finally moved out about two years ago when I was 19. So he lived with her for about 13 years. He has always been a worthless father in my eyes and is now also a worthless son.Today I visit my grandma, his mother. She tells me once her kitty passes away she is going to sell her house and move into assisted living. She told me she is choosing this option because the guy noted above, is her only family in town and barely answers her calls. Takes days to return the calls. Makes empty promises of things he will help her with, for example: shoveling snow and changing light bulbs. She is very healthy and active but she knows her limitations. She says he is not reliable to check in on her to make sure she is ok so, she feels more safe being around a community like an assisted living. Mind you, he lives no more than 7 minutes from her and has plenty of time in his day to give her a call.I am not implying that he owes her anything because she birthed him. Or that this should be his responsibility to watch after his mom in her old age. It’s that fact that this woman spent so many years, put so much effort and stress into him to help him get his life together. Now he can’t put in a small amount of effort to at least give her a phone call, lend a hand, do literally anything to return a favor.I wish I could step in more but I moved away for college. This situation breaks my heart and makes me angry. She lended her open arms for years and years and he can’t even offer her a hand. How do I deal with all this? We have never had a relationship and currently have almost no communication so this isn’t something that I feel comfortable confronting him about. This isn’t about me and I am not a main character. Now what?TL;DR my biological father was supported for many years by his mother, my grandma. In her old age he can’t make the smallest effort to help her out, forcing her to sell her house. I have anger against him already and this has only made it worse. How do I deal with anger caused by a situation that isn’t about me?Edit: Thank you to everyone for the support and good advice. There are more replies than I anticipated so I am sorry if I don’t reply to all of them but know I appreciate it so so much. Warms my heart when strangers take time out of their day to try and help other strangers164 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
ibv7wz,2.0kPosted by1 year agoArchivedMy (22 F) step-dad (49 m) publicly humiliated my mom and I and I don’t know how to move on.
              
            [new]The other day I went to sober cab my mom and her husband at the bar. Everything was fine when I got there, in fact, he and I were joking around and laughing with each other. Then over conversations about my weekend, my mom divulged some information that she heard regarding a situation I was in with my step brother (and not the way you’re thinking pervs lol). It was a brief conversation and I texted my step brother to update him on the situation. Then out of nowhere my step-dad exploded in a restaurant with customers all around us.He yelled “Jesus Christ you guys are like the Kardashians with all of this fucking drama, it’s RIDICULOUS!!!” Keep in mind my mom and I had a two minute discussion that wasn’t even deep whatsoever.He continued to scream at my mom and I, taking digs at my biological brother in attempt to offend my mom. He continued screaming at us as we sat silently. My mom tried to tell him to lower his voice because the restaurant had fallen silent at that point and everyone was staring at us. He then screamed “I DONT GIVE A FUCK WHAT ANYONE THINKS... I don’t give a FUCK. You guys are STUPID! This is RIDICULOUS!!” He repeated that loudly a couple of times as i STILL sat silent. Minutes have gone by at this point of him yelling.Over the course of the last couple years his anger has been growing and growing and he often snaps and lashes out now, resorting to name calling frequently but usually about politics. It has now spread to all sectors of his conversations when something manages to set him off.So, I finally turned to my mom and asked her if she wanted to leave because I was humiliated and couldn’t stand sitting next to him for any longer. My mom refused. She is used to this behavior. He acts like this toward her 24/7 now, but this time I noticed it spread to me as well. So I asked her again and said please. She refused. He heard me ask and then screamed even louder “IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE GET THE FUCK OUT. LEAVE. NO ONE IS KEEPING YOU HERE.” And I looked at him in the eyes and said “I’m trying to.” I couldn’t leave my mom there and to be honest I felt terrible for her because he’s been treating her horribly. Keep in mind, at this point it is uncomfortably silent in the room. Our server is awkwardly behind the bar pretending to be busy and the couple seated alongside us keeps looking up in concern. I’ve never been so humiliated in my life. I feel utterly disrespected and like I will never see him the same again. My heart aches for my mom because he eventually shoved his plate away loudly and bolted out the door, leaving us at the restaurant.I told her that what he just did was abusive and she was extremely dismissive. My biological father was verbally abusive to my mom and I think she struggles with understanding that it’s not normal. In the car she expressed to me that she was worried he wouldn’t want to be with her anymore. AFTER he continually disrespects and yells at her time after time... she’s worried that he doesn’t find her attractive anymore. That broke me. But, she continued to tell me that what he did wasn’t out of the blue and could’ve been worse. I started doubted how horrible the experience was myself and can see how she is gaslighted into believing that was an appropriate response.So, at this point I have no idea how to proceed. He has expressed no remorse and thinks his response was justified (he was buzzed at the time so perhaps his memory of the events isn’t perfect). I just feel like I can’t forgive this for a multitude of reasons. He has gotten increasingly angry in his consistent outbursts and I genuinely fear something is mentally wrong with him. I like to see my mom and she doesn’t do anything without him so ignoring him is out of the question. How do I proceed with some kind of normalcy after this knowing I won’t receive an apology or change of behavior?TDLR: My step-dad screamed at me in a restaurant for a prolonged period of time and publicly humiliated my mother and I. How do I move on knowing he won’t change?138 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted

            Personal issuesMy (35 F) ex (34 M) and I broke up a year ago. My family took the break up hard and were really hoping we'd reconcile. As recent as January my mom cried because she wanted us to reconcile. My ex and I have stayed on decent terms, speaking briefly every few weeks and genuinely (I think!)want what's best for each other.I've started seeing someone new (36 M). I'm very excited about this new relationship. We're both pretty smitten with each other, and he's had accidental brief encounters with my parents when they have unexpectedly come to my house when he's there. My parents know he exists but they don't ask about him, and it seems we're all tip toeing around the topic. I really want my parents to be welcoming and open to him and not keep holding onto the idea of my ex. How do I do this?tl;dr: Parents adore my ex and I don't know how to introduce my new bf to them111 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
i1tbez,1.9kPosted by1 year agoArchivedI (18M) want to break up with my girlfriend (21F) today but I don't feel like I'm strong enough to do it.
              
            BreakupsSince the beginning I felt like she and I weren't totally compatible but she treated me well at the very start, so I kept going on, then when we were in the 6th-9th month she treated me like I was a toy to her. That led me to try to treat her the same but I couldn't do it, I talked with her and she promised to change, and she did a bit, having the same issues often.Lately in our 14th month I haven't feel good due to some negative attitudes she had, and to be honest I want to break up with her today but the idea of her family hating me or myself feeling alone make me feel like I'm not ready to do it, and I don't feel strong enough.What should I do?...Edit: I didn't expect too much support, I can't believe that y'all are giving me your opinion and support. :( Thank you so much guys.TL;DR: I guess it's the common problem of not being brave enough to do what's the best for you, it's my first time taking a sharp decision like this.206 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted

            Non-RomanticMy fiancé and I have been together for 10 years and decided to tie the knot this upcoming summer. I have this coworker who doesn’t listen at all. It’s his way or not at all. My coworker (Jack) has assigned himself to be our florist after overhearing my conversation to my friend. He mentioned that he used to be a florist before working at our store. I never asked Jack to be our florist. I’ve politely told him no, we already have our flowers arranged. He asked where we’re getting married, I told him courthouse. He gasped and acted all dramatic about it and muttering that it wasn’t romantic enough.We haven’t talked since then. Now, since it’s Valentine’s Day, Jack brings up the flower thing again since he was working the floral section in our grocery store. I told him again that we already had our flowers. It was in one ear and out the other. He kept talking about how he was excited for my big day, and the flowers were gonna be so pretty, etc.I’ve walked away and pretty much haven’t said anything about my wedding to anyone because this guy just doesn’t get it. I’m fed up and have been avoiding Jack because that’s all he wants to talk about. I’ve told him no so many times. What else can I do?TL;DR: coworkers obsessed with flowers and won’t stop mentioning about his “job” in our wedding.111 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
jiwh65,1.8kPosted by1 year agoArchived[UPDATE] If my [M30] wife [F30] feels trapped I need to let her go - break up preparation?
              
            UpdatesHi guys.TLDR: I see no way of getting the relationship back to where I want it. I am preparing for divorce. I discovered my wife was a narcissist all the time.This is a followup to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ixm2wl/mym30_wifef30_openned_up_about_feeling_traped_in/Many of you guys recommended counceling, we tried that, but I aborted it after the first session, because I could only get her to talk about what she feels but she made clear she is not going to make any steps in my direction.Still the only thing that interests her is her online game and the guys who she plays with. She has somehow seen that our marriage is brittle and tries....but I feel that it is work for her and not something she wants to.2 Weeks ago we had a fight because she told me she wants to meet some guys in RL that she met online (all from other countries, so its not easy in this times) and that if she has feelings for them she wants to act them out. And if its not okay for me, I can end the relationship. Its up to my choice.In the last two weeks I have thought a lot about how to go on. And by now I am quite confident that letting her go (=divortion, not letting her go see that guys) is the only way. I honestly do not believe that we can manage that we can get together again, because at somepoint, there was simply no "us" anymore and that made me lose my trust in her.It hurts me that she is somehow trying now, but I cannot go on anymore with it. I recently discovered that she shows very strong signs of narcissism. Reading about it online gave me words to describe what was wrong in our relationship all the years.I am going to prepare myself for the following weeks. We live in a flat owned by my parents. I don't want to kick her out immideatly, but I will stay in that house which will be a very hard time for both of us.If you experienced a breakup please tell me what were the things you think you did very well and are happy with and what are the things you did wrong. Thank you!BIG UPDATE: Found out she had a cyber affair after actually being ready to make the separation talk when we come home. We fought, I couldn't make the hard cut and I broke in emotionally. We said we don't want to throw away what we have. But it felt fake. I looked through the files and found out there were self written love stories with her and one of the guys. It was dated 2 days before I googled online affairs and had a the feeling it was exactly that.i came to it because of some posts in the initial post. My belly feeling was right, this gives me a lot of self esteem! I got all the prove for this aswell.228 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
hmbenr,1.8kPosted by1 year agoArchivedMy(20) Boyfriend (24) is going on a girls trip
              
            [new]Throwaway as he knows my other acct.A few weeks ago my boyfriend of about 10 months (I also live with him) told me he was invited to go and spend the weekend at his female friend’s big house in the countryside with 6 girls. He said no to this offer as he thought it was a bit strange and I agreed.Cut to 2 days ago, he says that now only 4 girls will be there and that he wants to go now, but he said he doesn’t want to go unless I go with him, so of course I agreed to go. Now I am not allowed to come as it’s “close friends only” but he still wants to go.I don’t know why I am so upset by this. I will be alone for the entire he’s gone and constantly thinking about it. I have only met these girls once and so I’m a bit iffy about this whole situation but I am so upset that it threw me into a huge anxiety attack which I don’t think is normal.Could someone give me any input? am I being insane?TL;DR: My boyfriend is going away with 4 girls without me. I’m upset about it.Update kinda?left some things out when i first wrote this as i really didn’t expect so many responses (thank you for them all)  i am a girl by the way! sorry about that.i expressed my slight anger and overwhelming sadness about this when he first told me last night that i was not allowed to go anymore. he just said that i need to trust him. i was so visibly upset by this that i assumed he had changed his mind about going. but today he said he informed me he still wanted to go which just set me off again so i thought i’d try and get some impartial judgement from here.I do have a tendency to bottle things up as to not be a bother/be “controlling” but this is the one thing i really got upset about.me and these girls got along fine when i spent a few hours with them before. however i was always very worried about the girl hosting as bf was always talking about her / to her on the phone/ going for walks together and bought her a rather expensive birthday gift after sort of jokingly telling me he wouldn’t spend as much money on me. when i met her she was a bit stand offish but warmed up to me i suppose as we were quite tipsy. i just know they’ve been friends for a long time so if something was going to happen it probably would’ve by now ?also re: left alone, i didn’t mean to sound so dramatic about being left by myself. i just feel like he’s leaving to go and be with these girls while i’m having quite a rough time in other areas of my personal life so i was just wallowing a bit.thank you again for all your insightful comments be them comforting or harsh - i feel i’ve needed to hear them all. i am getting a bit worried one of them will see this though- was certainly not expecting this post to get so much attention!sorry for any bad spelling and grammar, it’s the middle of the night and i’ve been snivelling so much all day that my eyes resemble peaches & it’s quite hard to fully see what i’m typing.613 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
kgb5i0,1.8kPosted by10 months agoArchivedComments are locked2My husband's [28m] car got destroyed and now he's taking his frustrations out on me [24f]
              
            [new]We've been dating for 4 years, married for 11 months.Basically, a truck driver hit my husband's car and entirely destroyed it. It was a hit-and-run, so no one knows who the driver of the truck was which is ironic because almost all of our neighbours saw it happening but nobody bothered to write down the license plate number. The accident happened at around 7 am. Our whole neighbourhood started talking about it and three hours later one of them finally decided to let us know what happened. Needless to say, it was a shitty way to start the day.My husband loves his cars, especially this one. We're currently trying to figure things out with our insurance, but it's not looking good. My husband is super frustrated and angry, understandably so. Unfortunately, he's taking all of this frustration and anger out on me. He's yelling at me nonstop and forcefully pushes me out of the way when I'm standing in his way. I tried to comfort him and gently touched his arm but he slapped my hand away.I've never seen him like that and honestly, it's scaring me. I'm one of those people that immediately get emotional when someone raises their voice at them. Is there anything that I can do? How can I calm him down?TL;DR: My husband's car got destroyed in a hit-and-run and now he's taking his frustrations out on me.117 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
k3hgmp,1.7kPosted by11 months agoArchivedComments are locked2My (27F) half-sister (8F) is very violent towards me and hates me. I have to babysit her, but I'm going to give birth in 3 weeks and I can't take it anymore.
              
            Non-RomanticI apologize in advance; This post might be a long one and unfortunately english is not my native language, so there are probably thousands of grammar mistakes, sorry!My parents divorced when I was about 10 years old. My dad simply left and I've never heard from him ever since that divorce. When I was around the age of 15, my mom met a new guy and married him. He and my mom have two children (aka. my half-sisters): 10F and 8F. The 10-year-old is a lovely girl and I really like spending time with her, but the 8-year-old is a literal demon.My mom recently got a new job, so both my mom and her husband are working in the afternoon now, which means that someone needs to take care of the girls when they come home from school. I was asked by my mom to babysit them and I agreed. She helped me a lot during my pregnancy, so I wanted to do her a favor.Here's where things get complicated. My half-sisters are very spoiled and basically get away with everything. However, 10F can behave herself properly, whereas 8F cannot. She screams for hours, bites me, hits me, scratches me and literally hates me. I wish I knew why, but I really don't. She has always behaved that way towards me even though I've always been nice to her. Last night, she even called me a bxtch and then screamed herself hoarse for 4 hours. (Yes, 4 full hours of screaming.)8F's violent behaviour is stressing me out really bad and I wish I didn't have to babysit her, but I promised my mom I would do it. My mom and her husband know of 8F's violent behaviour towards me, but they don't see a problem with it, because they experience 8F's tantrums as well. She's significantly less violent towards my mom and her husband (at least when I'm there), but she shows a very similar behaviour.My husband (29M) is constantly in a state of distress, because he wants me to rest at home instead of babysit my half-sisters at my mom's house. He's not happy about this situation at all, but I can't stop babysitting my half-sisters, because there is no other option. My mom can afford a professional babysitter, but all of us agreed that that's just not a safe option during a pandemic.What am I supposed to do? I can't keep babysitting, but I also can't stop right now, because someone HAS to watch the girls. I really can't take this anymore. I'm tired and stressed out and on top of that I'm going to give birth in 3 weeks.TL;DR: My half-sister is very violent towards me and hates me. I have to babysit her, but I'm going to give birth in 3 weeks and I can't take it anymore.136 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
lmwytt,1.7kPosted by8 months agoArchived228UPDATE: "I [22f] can't keep myself from crying during arguments with my bf [27m]." How to move on?
              
            Breakupsoriginal postWell...almost exactly two years ago (two years and 3 days), I (now 24) posted here about getting frustrated about crying during arguments with my boyfriend (now 29).The comments really highlighted the fact that I had buried the lede—I was crying because my boyfriend didn't respect or understand my emotional needs and I didn't know how to express them without being met with defensiveness or anger.2 years later, that has not changed.  I broke up with him yesterday, after 4 years of heartache and hoping that I could singlehandedly fix the relationship by working on my (admittedly very imperfect) communication.  We started seeing a therapist in June last year, and she has been wonderful in helping us communicate and talk through problems.  Unfortunately, and agonizingly, our slightly improved communications allowed me to realize that our needs are fundamentally incompatible, and that overcoming 4 years of awful communication and traumatic relationship events is too difficult for me to handle right now.If you're familiar with attachment theory, I am definitely anxiously-attached, and my now-ex boyfriend is definitely avoidant.  I would push - push him to communicate, to hear me, to understand my feelings - and that would cause him to pull away or shut me out...which only increased my anxiety and my attempts to get him to hear me.  2 years ago, we were fighting once a month.  Lately, we've been fighting once a week.  Just a really terribly vicious circle that has completely worn down my self esteem and contentment over time.The worst for me was about a year and a half ago, when my dad was diagnosed with cancer.  My boyfriend would call me on my lunch break every day of that week, which I appreciated.  I went over to his house on the weekend, hoping for some support.  At 7pm, the start of his weekly game night, he said "well, it's time for game night" - and went.  When I cried and tried to express to him how much that hurt me, he coldly responded by telling me I'm high maintenance.I don't think I've been able to work past this event, internally.  We've tried.  He didn't apologize for it until we were in therapy, and I've struggled to truly forgive and move on.  I never was able to articulate my feelings in a way that I thought he might be receptive to, so I stopped bringing it up.  But it definitely stewed.I don't think he's a bad person.  Recognizing my own resentment toward him was what allowed me to end the relationship.  I finally understood that while I certainly feel hurt by some of his actions, and hurt because he didn't seem able to meet my needs, that's a result of our differing needs and expectations.  Yeah, I would have loved for him to prioritize me over his video games.  But I think I understand now that it's alright for him to prioritize games over me, and it's alright for me to be uncomfortable about it and to walk away because of it.I'm going to miss him so much.  I feel broken and alone.  When I broke up with him, I sobbed the entire time, and he responded calmly and almost emotionlessly. How do I deal with this?  I don't know how to heal, and I don't know how to forgive myself for toughing this out for 4 years.  I know it's not (edit: entirely) my fault, but part of me still finds ways to blame myself.  I don't know what to do.Tl;dr - broke up with my dismissive avoidant boyfriend of 4 years.  Completely a wreck, feel like I've wasted time and disrespected my own emotional needs by staying with him, but miss him terribly. How do I move on?Edit - Thank you all for sharing your experiences and advice with me.  It's really helped me through a tough day.  I'm sure the weeks ahead will be hard, but I will keep all of your support in mind :)185 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
nut6ss,1.7kPosted by4 months ago25I (24F) am drifting away from my once close family and I don’t know how to handle it.
              
            Personal issuesTl;dr- My family dynamics are changing and I am growing apart from my family. I want to maintain some sort of relationship but don’t know how.My family has always been really close and we have always enjoyed each others company. I’m talking about everyone in my household, not so much extended family. Now that I am an adult I feel like it is not going to be like this for much longer. I have chosen a very different life path than the rest of my family. I have a very demanding career and I am not planning on having any children whereas nearly everyone in my family is married and has children by 21. Also, now that I’m older I realize everything was not as perfect as I thought and some of them are very toxic people. For some reason it is still very painful letting go of the family part of my life. I never want to lose my mom but I am moving states away soon. On one hand I am relieved to have my own life without the toxic people but I miss my mom and sister so much and fear they will be mad that I left the family. It’s like everything I once valued and believed in is completely changing so fast and it is a bit shocking. I know it is part of this age in life but do any of you have any advice on how to handle maintaining a good relationship when life is taking you a different way? Also any wisdom on how to handle all of the changes that happen as you grow up would be greatly appreciated. I have never posted on here before so my apologies if this is a weird post!Edit: I have never asked for advice on reddit before and you guys are amazing! Im not exaggerating when I say every post has made a difference. I knew other people had these problems too but reading all of your experiences has made this giant weight feel much lighter. I didn’t realize just how lonely this stuff makes you feel. You guys have made me and everyone here much less lonely by sharing your experiences and advice. Thank you all for showing so much support and care in your responses :).100 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
o2zlnw,1.8kPosted by4 months agoMe (32M) and my friend (27M) have been having sex on and off for the past 4 months. He won't even acknowledge that it is happening.
              
            [new]I am openly bisexual and my friend knows this. We often hang out one on one, especially since the pandemic, because we go to the gym together and live pretty close. One night we got pretty drunk and he was asking me about me being bisexual and how it felt to suck a penis and all this other stuff, and I got this weird kinda vibe he wanted to do something but was too scared to ask. I had done this before with straight guys. I was one of the only openly bisexual men at my high school and in college the only one on the baseball team. When your in that position, you have a lot of 'straight' men ask you to experiment with them, in confidence. Anyways, we ended up 'experimenting', and by that I mean we both gave each other handjobs while we watched porn. It was fun. I mean, I had always been pretty attracted to him, but I never thought this would ever happen.2 weeks went by and we didn't speak about it at all. And then, I was driving him home after we all went to a bar, and he gave me a blowjob. At that point I realized it was more than just experimenting, he genuinely enjoyed it. Since then there have been a lot of these kind of quick sexual moments where we usually just give each other head, and then never mention it again. Usually after we work out. But this guy is so unbelievably deep in the closet that even after 4 months, and probably like 20+ times of this happening, he cant even put it into words what we are doing. I have to use a codeword with him to ask if we wanna do something, saying "do you wanna come to my room?", and then, when we are in my room, I ask if he wants to watch porn, and then we have to slowly maneuver to the actual acts. It is like a ritual of plausible deniability for him. It feels almost like he cant even say or acknowledge what is happening until it actually is happening, in which he will do the actions but never really speak. It is, frankly, incredibly awkward. But we are somewhat used to the awkwardness now.I don't entirely know what to do here. If I should just sit down with him and be like... hey, you can TALK to me about this stuff, it doesn't have to be so awkward. I remember one time I mentioned the concept of a blowjob to him when we were watching a movie and he looked so shocked at me, like it was taboo to ever mention or talk about this stuff. It has to be done in silence and in secret. I mean I've never had sex which is so unbelievably robotic and emotionless. I don't dislike it, he is a very attractive, fit guy, but I am not really sure what he expects from this.What should I do here?TL;DR - - I have been having basically emotionless sex with my friend over the past 4 months because he is so deep in the closet that he cant even talk about us having sex173 commentssharesavehidereport95% Upvoted
nb1jcp,1.8kPosted by5 months agoComments are locked3Nightmare Situation: Me(35F) with Partner(40M), my son and his nephew (15Ms)
              
            RelationshipsEDIT: Thank you all so much for your support, advice and kind words! Your comments have given me a lot to think about, and I will be making contact with a family lawyer shortly.Four years ago I met Bob (40M). Bob had recently become the guardian of his nephew Ben after the death of Ben's parents in a car accident. Ben is the same age as my son Jason, 11 at the time, now 15.At first it seemed perfect. I was over the moon at finding a man who was not put off by the prospect of taking on a soon-to-be teenage stepson (Jason's father is not in the picture), and in spite of being very different personalities, the boys got along from the beginning, so Bob and Ben moved into my house within less than a year.Ben was always a quieter, more creative kid where Jason is more athletic and boisterous, and from the start I got the sense that Bob 'understood' Jason's way of being more than he did Ben's. At first he would take them both to sports games, but Ben obviously had no interest and so pretty soon he just took Jason. At the time it seemed like a natural choice - Ben was bored at the games and Jason honestly reveled in having all Bob's attention - but after that things started unraveling. As they grew older the difference in the boys became more obvious (their choices of clothing, hairstyle, friends, music, hobbies, etc.), and so did Bob's preference. He started making little comments comparing them and encouraging Ben to be more like Jason. At first it seemed like he was trying to be helpful, thinking that Jason's way of being was healthier (he's more outgoing, has a more active social life, etc) because that's what he remembered from his own experience, but after a while there was clear snideness there which it was impossible not to hear. My son has always had a strong protective streak/sense of fairness, and in spite of their differences and the late age they were introduced, he and Ben are very close, so Jason's reaction to Bob's remarks favouring him was to take Ben's side. He stopped going to games with Bob and generally liking him, and for a while became openly hostile on Ben's behalf. That stopped once he and Bob had a major argument. Jason backed down at that point because, he told me, he realised that if he kept making himself unpleasant, Bob and I might break up, in which case Ben would have to leave too. Since then, with a few exceptions, he has been coldly civil. Meanwhile, Bob has come to believe Ben is gay based on what I consider spurious evidence (not that it matters to me whether he is or not). He wanted to send him to a military type reform school, and when I vetoed that, his behaviour towards Ben has escalated to a subtle kind of downright nastiness.Needless to say, all of the above strained Bob's and my relationship to breaking point and then broke it. Seeing his ongoing behaviour towards a child who needs him I can no longer look at him with anything but disgust. The thought of him touching me makes my skin crawl and I desperately want him out of my house (we're not married and it's still in my sole name, thank God), but now I have the same problem Jason was worried about: If I end the relationship and kick Bob out, Ben will have to go to, since legally I have no tie to him whatever. He's fifteen now and although he has borne everything by stoically ignoring Bob, I can't in good conscious let that man be solely responsible for him (for what it's worth, I have always tried to stick up for him and get Bob to see that there are many types of boy in the world and all of them are equally okay). Not to mention, I don't think Jason would ever forgive me if I did. I would happily take guardianship of Ben if I could, even if Bob made no financial contribution at all we could manage if we cut back on luxuries. My concern is that I am far from sure Bob would agree. However he personally feels about Ben, Ben is still his flesh and blood and Bob feels strongly about that (to be honest I think it's part of the reason he resents Ben so much - Ben is 'the last of the line' and not turning out how Bob thinks his family should be represented). If I were to start a conversation along those lines and Bob refused to allow Ben to stay, it would be incredibly difficult to roll back. The idea of having to continue to play his supportive wife to stop him leaving of his own accord for another two and a half years (till Ben turns 18) sounds like a nightmare, but the alternative is worse. What is the best way to manage and get through this?TL;DR: Partner has shown himself to be abusive and homophobic towards his nephew. I want to leave him, but if I do he will likely take his nephew with him. What do I do?70 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
kothne,1.6kPosted by9 months agoArchivedComments are locked26My beloved eats like a cement mixer
              
            RelationshipsI (M, 35) met my now-girlfriend (F, 30) at the start of 2020. Neither of us was particularly looking for a relationship, but I guess sometimes you just can't ignore what's staring you in the face. She's completely wonderful - warm, insightful, funny and beautiful - to the point where her interest in me can sometimes feel like a clerical error, and yet I've never felt so appreciated. I'd go so far as to say that, quite apart from making me fall deeply in love with her, she's dangerously close to making me like myself.And if that sounds too good to be true, let me just remind you that, as per the title of this thread, she chews like a yak with a mouthful of superglue and I don't know what to do about it.Please understand that I really don't *want* to care, not least because it would almost certainly hurt her feelings if she knew that it bothered me, but it does bother me. I find myself rubbing my face to self-soothe when we eat together, feeling pronounced stress and anxiety about the sounds in the first instance, and then feeling even more stress and anxiety about the possibility of her clocking my stress and anxiety.I'm not sure that I'm able to ignore this as I might never become desensitised to it, but equally I don't want to raise it with her if it might be a "me problem". I've done a bit of reading into misophonia (a condition whereby some people can have disproportionate emotional reactions to ordinary sounds) and I'm open to the possibility that I have some mild version of that going on, in which case maybe the answer is for me to get therapy?However, this isn't something I've experienced again and again throughout my life. Only once before can I remember having an irrational response to the sound of someone eating. That was my sister crunching on breath mints when we were children, at least a quarter of a century ago, and we were constantly annoyed with each other about one thing or another back then so I'm not sure that there's a whole lot I can read into that. The sounds my girlfriend makes when she eats are something completely new and alien to me, and I think my reaction is specific to them.Which brings me to the flipside: if it isn't just a "me problem" and her eating habits are going to bother other people in her personal and professional life, then do I have an obligation to tell her so that she has the chance to address it?I just don't know what to do. Please help me before I stress-rub the cheeks right off my face.TL;DR: Girlfriend makes remarkably loud noises while eating. I don't know if I should be keeping my mouth shut or politely asking her to.273 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
i52nid,1.6kPosted by1 year agoArchivedI [52 M] purchased a recreation property from my [78 M] father-in-law with the proviso he can stay in it for a month each year. He's now squatting and will only allow others to stay when he's not using it. How do I respectfully inform him he is overstepping the agreement?
              
            Non-RomanticWith Covid he's been there for most of the last four months and we've only used it a week or two. He sent a note today saying we couldn't use it next month because he will be there. But we've had this trip planned since June. It seems he wants to sell the property and own it at the same time. (He's owned it for twenty years prior to selling.) Most of the extended family feel we are being more than fair, but don't want to confront him. We all think he might be having cognitive issues. How do we approach this with him? It's like because we let him stay during these extenuating circumstances, he's reverted back to thinking he owns the place. He owns a full-time home so it's not that he'd be homeless or even need to find a new place. Thanks!tl;dr: How do we respectfully evict our father-in-law from a property he formerly owned but he's sold to us?78 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
n5hlsh,1.6kPosted by5 months agoComments are locked2I (17m) cannot get my parents (45m, 44f) to listen to me regarding my sister's (6f) educational needs
              
            Non-RomanticOKay so I am currently in my second year of college (child genius, got fast tracked through grades) and I have two younger sisters 'Jess' (14f) and 'Ana'. Ana was born fully deaf and is starting elementary school this year.I'm not trying to throw my parents into a negative light. They do love us, they've provided us with every opportunity possible and we have wanted for nothing growing up. Even though my parents were thrown when they found out Ana was deaf (they are musicians by trade and both me and Jess have been involved with music from a young age) they learned ASL along with me and my sister and tried their hardest to adapt.That said, I have always been closest with Ana as she's grown up and she's like my best friend. She's always come to me if she's afraid or sick, she looks to me for interpretation or context when we're out and she's always been my little shadow. So, out of everyone in our family, I feel I know her the best.My parents are sending Ana to a private special needs school in the coming year and I...personally disagree with their choice.I looked into the place, took a virtual tour, and from everything I have seen and read it seems to be catered more to students with severe mental disabilities or mobility-impaired. In fact, I couldn't see a great deal of detail about the services provided for deaf students at all. I brought this up to my parents but they just brushed me off, saying it was what was best and they'd take care of her. I asked why she can't go to a mainstream school but they said there were no services for her.Well, I did a bunch of research. I contacted district superintendents, local council, even schools directly themselves. I even found a deaf school only very slightly out of our boundary who said they were willing to be flexible. When I brought this to my parents they got annoyed, saying that they knew what was best for their daughter and I should stay out of it and that no school would be able to handle her hearing impairment AND behavioral problems.I was stunned. Ana doesn't have behavioral problems. She's a bit willful, sure, she has a mind of her own and she's always had a mischievous streak but she's never acted out of control. She can read and write above average for her age (I know because I read with her) and while she's a little slow on the math front, I doubt it's any real cause for concern. I asked if she had been diagnosed and they cited the times she's wandered off during trips to the theatre or made noises during the performance. They haven't seen a doctor or any professional about this. They just saw a deaf child being forced to sit still for hours, not understanding everything that's going on around her and acting out of boredom and frustration and decided she's got behavioral issues.Ana is a bright kid and while the school they've picked out looks amazing for kids with disabilities...I just don't think it would suit her specifically. But despite all my arguments and despite me spending more time with Ana than either of them combined, they still tell me to shut up and not get involved with their decisions because they're the adults, which really annoys me because I've been forced to act like an adult my whole life but as soon as I want a say on something actually important, they shut me down and potentially take away my sister's potential to thrive.TL;DR: My parents seem to think that my deaf sister belongs in a school for severely disabled children because they're convinced no school can 'handle her' despite my arguments and evidence to the contrary.EDIT: sort of an update but not really. I just wanted to clarify a few recurring points that have arisen throughout both comments and PMs.1.) I mention the skipping grades thing because I thought it would explain why I was a 17-year-old sophomore in college and why I felt like I was qualified to intervene with the decision-making process. I've been involved in adult conversations, been surrounded by adults who regard and treat me as a peer most of my life. I apologize if I was unclear.2.) Someone mentioned that my parents would recognize behavioral issues in Ana because they have raised two children before her. I would disagree with this as 1. Every child is different. Jess and I have very different temperaments and personalities, same as Ana. 2. My parents have raised two hearing children who are regarded as intelligent and mature for their age. Seeing a deaf 6-year-old acting like a 6-year-old, I would argue, is relatively new to them.3.) I have actually gotten involved with a local Deaf Advocacy group for deaf/HOH adults and their friends/families, we're having a meeting via Zoom on Monday night and I'm looking forward to getting their insight!4.) On a slightly more serious note, some of you have expressed concern about my mom and dad's parenting and that I am being parentified, that they are ableist, that I'm too young to have these concerns regardless of my intelligence or maturity. I have thought on this a lot and on some level I think you might be right. My parents don't like to be told they're wrong or made to feel like they don't know something and I don't think they have adapted to Ana's hearing impairment as well as they believe and on some level, think it reflects badly on them. Admittedly, I can see some of their flaws reflected in me and I am trying to work on that. I do wonder if one of the reasons Ana is so attached to me is because I do give her affection and attention where our parents aren't as forthcoming. Regardless of whether I am too young, there is a little girl that needs someone to rely on and if that is me, then I'll take up that mantle. I love my sister and I want to strive to make the world better for her.5.) I'm going to try a more subtle approach to this, rather than treating it like a debate with my parents (working on those flaws!) If anything comes of it, I'll be sure to update you! Thank you for all your comments and advice, it's been great to hear from so many people!98 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
n9q8k4,1.5kPosted by5 months agoComments are lockedI (28M) messed up by asking my girlfriend (26F) to stop talking about her late boyfriend
              
            [new]Her college boyfriend passed away in an accident 5 years ago. I (28M) understand that he will always be part of her(26F) life and she will always love him. her grief and trauma and how she dealt with losing her boyfriend is a part of who she is as a person. we have been dating for 2 years.The problem is that she brings him into our relationship. Every time I make a mistake or get hurt. she always brings up how he used to treat her and how I should try to be more like him. She doesn't do it an accusatory way but it still kinds stings. It has been getting to me.Yesterday, I got news that I received the promotion I had been vying for. I was not very hopeful about getting it. It was a position which had many candidates from all different departments. We celebrated a little. We started to talking about how we could do all the things we had planned for. In the middle of the conversation, I joked about being too anxious about these things. she responded by saying that Her Boyfriend had always been so calm and collected. Very chill about everything. He could just shrug off anything.I am exactly the opposite. I am anxious and a person who worries a lot. I don't know why but it hurt me a lot. I asked her to stop talking about him. She looked offended but didn't respond and I just ruined the night. we sat there for a few minutes before she decided to clean up and go to bed early.I feel like I am being compared against someone I will never match up to. I know that he is very important to her but can't she cherish him without making me feel like shit. She has been distant today. I know she is hurt. She has barely spoken to me today.I feel, I should have just ignored her comments and rolled with it. My message and delivery were all wrong. I feel guilty about hurting her. I should have done a better job of being sensitive about this and brought it up when she were celebrating.I want to sort this out and have a productive conversation with her so that we can deal with this issue, How need some help going about that.Tl;DR : Girlfriend compares me to her later boyfriend. It has been getting to me and I didn't approach issue in the right way and now things are a bit awkward.40 commentssharesavehidereport100% Upvoted
laksa7,1.4kPosted by8 months agoArchivedComments are lockedMy best friend (29) won’t speak to me since I (29f) got engaged two months ago.
              
            Non-RomanticHi!So as the title suggests, my best friend has not spoken to me since the beginning of December.Molly (name changed) and I met three years ago on social media. We had been following each other because we have similar interests and live in the same town. One day she messaged me asking to be friends and the rest is history. I was very excited because I don’t have many friends and it was so nice to have so many things in common. I already knew of Molly’s long term (10 years) boyfriend, Tony, because he is a semi-popular musician in our town.Molly is an angel of a human being. Hard working, caring, a real catch, honestly. I would frequently joke to Tony that if he wasn’t going to put a ring on it soon, I would...and that leads me into this whole disaster. As I mentioned, Tony is a fairly well known musician in our town. He is also known as an overgrown 12 year old. He is basically your annoying little brother, just taller and with facial hair. I don’t dislike the guy at all, he is very talented and fun to be around (in small doses). Do I see what Molly sees in him? No absolutely not. He farts and burps at the dinner table, insists on blasting while we’re trying to have conversations, sleeps until 3pm, is unnecessarily loud, demands Molly to cook for him 3 meals a day, has never unloaded a dishwasher or cleaned a thing in his life, etc. Molly is way out of his league, honestly. Yet, she loves him and thinks sun shines out of his behind.The first time I asked Molly about what she wants out of life in the future she immediately said marriage and kids. I asked about where Tony stands in that area she said he obviously wants the same. Tony even has his grandmothers ring that was given to him to propose to her. I asked “do you guys talk about it?”. That’s when it came up that he basically shuts down or changes the subject. She doesn’t see anything wrong with him responding that way because he just “doesn’t like serious conversations”. This worried me for her, but at this point we didnt know eachother well so I didn’t say anything. As time went on she would talk about wanting to get engaged. She would send me links to rings she liked and ask me to send them to Tony. I did, and every time he would either threaten to block me or ignore me. She sent me her wedding Pinterest board. I sent it to him, he ignored me. She sent me this really heart wrenching message about how the anniversary of their first date was coming up and how special it would be if he proposed, I told him about it, he told me to shut up.I stopped sending him things after a while because to me, it was very clear. I don’t think he wants to commit. I will admit I never actually said that to her, although I don’t know if she would ever listen. She always told me I don’t know nearly as much about relationships as her because I was either single or not with my boyfriend (now fiancé) as long as she was with Tony.I met Noah a year after I met Molly. I wasn’t looking for anything because I had come out of a long term abusive relationship a year and a half prior, but Noah is something else. He is a total gem. He treats me so incredibly well, and although we took things slow, I knew he was the one quickly. Molly was really happy for me and we ended up hanging out as a group often. Noah and Tony became pretty good friends too.As my relationship with Noah got more serious and we moved in together, Molly joked a few times about killing me if I got engaged before her. Noah and I talked often about our future. He is 3 years younger than me so it was important that we were on the same page. I want to be married and have kids before I’m 35. The only thing that we don’t agree on right now is I want to elope and he wants a huge wedding!My town has been in and out of lockdown for a year now and while we haven’t seen our friends often at all, we have kept in touch daily. Since Noah and I have basically been alone together this whole time we also have been talking more seriously about our future. I had no idea he had a ring and was going to propose to me when he did, though. He surprised me with my dream ring two months ago and I could not have been more happy.I called Molly before I called my family. She didn’t pick up so I texted her a picture of it. I waited a while and didn’t hear back so I called my family. Hours go by and I haven’t heard from her. I thought it was weird but was in complete bliss so I posted a picture on social media and got drunk with my now fiancée and went to bed. Next morning, still nothing from Molly. She did see my picture on social media though.I talk to Noah and that’s when he tells me she was cold towards him when he showed her the ring he wanted to get me a few months earlier. I text Molly a few more times, and call her multiple times. She has not spoken to me in two months as of today. I reached out to Tony to make sure she was alive and she is, she just won’t speak to me.I completely understand that she is upset. And when I reached out after the ring picture I told her that. I told her we don’t have to talk about wedding stuff even. I’m not trying to plan a wedding any time soon. I just want to talk to my best friend. I’m completely heart broken.Noah thinks I should stop reaching out because this kind of behaviour is selfish on her end. I disagree personally, I can see why she is upset I just want to talk to her.Should I give up, say something specific, move on?TLDR: best friend has not spoken to me since I got engaged. Her bf of 10 years won’t commit and I think she’s jealous that mine of 2 years will. Should I move on or ask for her back in my life?EDIT: I accidentally left out that every time Molly asked me to send Tony something I screenshotted his responses. Whether he told me to shut up or ignored me, she saw it. When I stopped sending things his way I told her that I didn’t want to anymore because he clearly isn’t interested.edit 2: Tony is 38 and Noah is 27Edit 3: English is not my first language, I’m sorry for any grammar mistakes!52 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted

hnaefd,1.4kPosted by1 year agoArchivedMy (31F) Boyfriend (31M) of 11 years proposed right after a fight where I brought up my unhappiness of not being engaged for the first time. I'm feeling really sad about the proposal and it's aftermath.
              
            [new]My boyfriend and I have been together for over 11 years. Even though we've been together for a really long time, life circumstances made it understandable that we weren't engaged. We were together for about two years when we were both in undergrad, then he graduated and moved to another state for grad school. It took me another two years to finish undergrad (super, super senior), and after that I remained in the same school for my masters. When he finished school, he moved across the country for a job, and when I finished, I moved out there as well. All in all, we were long distance for four years.Things were going well for about a year and a half, then we both lost our jobs around the same time, sending us into about two years of financial hardship and tough times that we made through together, with a stronger bond than ever before. At the end of all this, we had been together for about nine years.Now for another 1.5 years things were going very well again. We paid off most of the debt that we acquired during the hard times, and we've officially been back on our feet for quite some time now. So for about a year I been thinking a proposal was imminent. I knew he wanted a future with me, and we talk about our lives together all the time. How many kids we want, etc. I was bringing up marriage a lot, and have been into marriage related reality TV a bit and will talk to him about it sometimes. I was bringing up conversations like, "when we get married where do you want to go on our honeymoon."  Basically everything but straight up saying, "lets get married." I really thought that this past Christmas back home with our families would be it, but when that didn't happen, I felt really crushed. I haven't been able to get it out of my mind since.He's never made me feel special really on my birthday or done anything for Valentine's Day, and I really wanted this to be something he did on his own. Our relationship started because I pursued him, and I wanted to feel wanted and desired. As the months of 2020 passed by, I became more and more resentful that he still hasn't asked, then in about April, we heard that his younger brother of six years was about to propose to his girlfriend that he's been with for about a quarter of the time we've been together. I couldn't take it anymore. My anger about the situation was building and building, and a couple of weeks ago my feelings came out.We were talking about trauma from an abusive ex I had in high school before I met him. This relationship gave me a lot of issues with worthiness and shame that have taken me years and years to process. I brought up in the conversation that I still wasn't over how long it took him to tell me he loved me (about two years), and that it played into these feeling of unworthiness in my early to mid 20's. He felt like I was being unreasonable to still not be over that when he tells me now everyday that he loves me. I felt like I had to tell him my feelings about not being engaged in that moment, and the words, "why aren't we married," just seemed to escape my lips.He said almost immediately in defense, "We can get married," but the conversation deteriorated into a huge fight from there. He said that I robbed him of the opportunity to genuinely ask me, but also confessed that he had no intention of asking me this year at all. He said that we will never have that beautiful moment now. He said that I can never be sure that it is genuine now, because I had to force things to happen, instead of letting them happen organically.I said I felt like I had to do it, because I was growing so resentful, I felt like there was no other choice. I said that I can't put my life on hold any longer, and that I deserve a say in when things in my life happen too. We both want kids and are about to turn 32. We both want to be married when we have kids. I don't understand how he wasn't thinking about proposing.He was enraged and I was hysterically crying, so we gave each other some space for a couple of hours. I was laying in bed, and he came to lay beside me. He said some really sweet things about how much he loves me and apologized for the fight and for not realizing earlier how important it was for me to be married. It was a very sweet moment. He then asked me to marry him with us both laying there on the bed. It was really nice an sincere, but at the same time I was deeply hurt that it was the way it played out. I never wanted a big proposal AT ALL, but I did want him to do something considerate and special. I have never been traditional, but always imagined that he would at least get on one knee.It just felt weird after that. Like not even real. I asked him if we should tell our families that we are engaged, and he said that of course we should, because we are engaged now. The next day I called my parents who were ecstatic. They've been wanting this for me for years, and they love my boyfriend.  It started to feel more real, and I was excited for it.Here's where it gets confusing and frustrating. He told his parents the next day too, and they never reached out to me and said anything. Nothing. This has also hurt me tremendously. I know his parents like me, and I am so confused that they wouldn't congratulate me or say anything about me becoming part of their family.I've thought about this moment my whole life, and I never thought it would play out like this at all. I know things never happen like you expect and life isn't a fairy tale, but I really wanted to feel desired. I wanted him to want to lock this down.We went to a national park this holiday weekend, and I was just hoping against hope that he would recreate the proposal there. He knew that while I was happy that we were engaged now, I was still a little hurt with how it played out, and he knew i was soar about his parents not acknowledging it to me. I know he's not expected to read my mind, but I really wanted him to get down on one knee at this park and make a moment we could remember.Now we just got into another huge fight tonight after I see a text from his dad saying that they had traveled out of state to surprise his brother's girlfriend and be there for their proposal. They have photos and videos they wanted to share with him and they seemed really excited. I was looking at something on his phone when he received this text and immediately started shaking. I'm incredibly mad and incredibly hurt that they haven't said a thing to me, yet traveled to his brother's fancy surprise proposal.I started yelling at my boyfriend and I told him I don't want his parents at our wedding. I didn't mean that, and I regret saying it, but I was so mad in that moment. He got really offended by this and started screaming at me, so I told him that I had hoped he had proposed again more formally last weekend, and we are now not speaking to each other.Well, he texted his parents and told them that I was mad at them. I am now embarrassed and don't know how to proceed. They called and texted me congratulations, but I have yet to respond. If they didn't do it two weeks ago, what does it even mean now. I'm too upset to talk to them on the phone tonight, and I am worried it looks really bad now.How do I move forward from this in a positive way? Where do we go from here?Edit: I so appreciate every reply on this post. I never expected to get so many replies, and I am taking my time to read and consider every one. I think there has been so much valuable feedback, both critical of me and in my favor. I don't want this to be about who is more right and I know that we both play a role in how we behave to each other. I'm at work right now, but I will be responding to more of these comments when I can, and you have all given me a lot to think about. Thank you so much!TLDR; My boyfriend only proposed when I asked him too. He never puts in any effort to make me feel special in any way, even though we have a profoundly special bond and both love each other a lot. His parents also never acknowledged the engagement, making things even worse.439 commentssharesavehidereport94% Upvoted
mho7jd,1.3kPosted by6 months agoArchived32[UPDATE] I’ve dropped enough hints. I’m ready to get married.
              
            UpdatesClick here for original postI (27 F) had a great conversation with my boyfriend (31 M). He said he absolutely had a plan to propose within the next year and would love to go engagement ring shopping. He’s still 100% committed to getting married and doesn’t want to put it off. I’m so freaking happy about this as I thought it was gonna end badlyTL;DR open communication is so important. I’m likely getting engaged within the next year.EDIT: Wow this really blew up! Wanted to address some replies. So yes we’ve been dating over 2 years. This is not a new conversation we’ve been having, and he’s definitely indicated he’s ready to get married and settle down. We discussed previously him proposing and we came to an agreement on that. I just misunderstood and my anxiety got the best of me. We’ve gone through questionnaires and talked about big picture stuff (e.g. kids, living situation, religion). I asked if finances were an issue and he confirmed it’s not. We’re both financially stable. I said within the next year, but that was my words, not his. I believe he is waiting for a certain day/event but he wants to keep it a surprise. Thanks for the feedback! It’s so hard to know the ins and outs of someone’s relationship based on one Reddit post.166 commentssharesavehidereport91% Upvoted
k9c84u,1.3kPosted by10 months agoArchivedComments are lockedMy (27F) boyfriend (28M) is obsessed with my ex (27M).
              
            [new]We’ve been together for 2 years and before this, I would say our relationship was very close to perfect.At the beginning of the year though, my boyfriend and I were at the grocery store and we bumped into my ex and another friend. This was the first time they had ever met each other. We made polite conversation before going our separate ways. My boyfriend made a sarcastic comment about how nice my ex was when he was out of earshot. I didn’t think much of it at the time.A few weeks after this, I noticed he was on my ex’s Facebook page. When I asked him what he was doing, he shrugged it off and said he was curious because he saw my ex had commented on Luke’s (a mutual friend of ours and my ex’s) post. He’s since friended him on there and claimed my ex was the one to initiate it.He’s followed him on Instagram and twitter too. He comments on a lot of his posts too but my ex rarely comments back. He also somehow got Luke to invite him to my ex and his friends’ weekly (virtual) hangouts. I mentioned I found it weird that they were hanging out but he dismissed it and said it wasn’t a big deal. He’s also started talking about changing his career path to what my ex is doing and makes snide comments about if his dad paid his way for him, he could take me on fancy trips too.He’s also become incredibly passive aggressive towards me and makes comments about how if my ex didn’t move abroad for a few years we probably would never have dated. If I say no to anything (including sex) he comments about how he bets I wouldn’t say no if my ex was the one asking. He also got really sulky when he realised I still had a gift my ex gave me.Yesterday we had a massive fight over it because I wanted to spend time together, but he ditched me to go hangout with my ex. I got so upset I told him he might as well date my ex instead.I don’t really know what to do now. He’s giving me the silent treatment and I heard him tell my ex what I said which is really humiliating. What can I do to make him stop hanging out with my ex?TL;DR – My boyfriend is weirdly obsessed with my ex and has gone out of his way to join his friendship circle. He’s also become passive aggressive towards me since spending more time with him.28 commentssharesavehidereport100% Upvoted
hm1wdi,1.3kPosted by1 year agoArchivedComments are lockedMy[m26] wife[f26] isn’t happy
              
            RelationshipsMy wife and I met close to 6 years ago. Crazy over each other and really intimate. After we got engaged the intimacy started to die down and a couple months before the wedding my wife cut of all sexual acts stating she wanted to wait until we got married. After getting married that didn’t change. She stated she just didn’t have the hormones she had when we were young and crazy and her sexual drive just wasn’t there. I also thought it could be related to her weight gain(self esteem issues), but I just said as long as nothing was wrong with us I can live with it.The first year of marriage turned out to be terrible. A lot of arguments and disagreements. She got a job offer where she had to leave 2 hours away for training and ended up being there for months and making no effort to come back home. She eventually told me she wasn’t happy. She said she felt like I was not holding my wait around the house and she always had to tell me what to do. So I really worked on changing and managed to contribute a lot more around the house(laundry, cleaning, cooking, and so on). Things drastically changed and it seemed to be back to normal and even better. Still not really intimate.The second year came around and we seemed to be continuing to do well. We got involved in activities together and didn’t really fight much at all. The only problem was she wanted to move. She had a lot of bad memories from the area she grew up in and wanted to get away from there. So we agreed to move and she wanted to move back to my hometown. So we did.We ended up moving in with my parents for a couple months to save up and look for a house. It wasn’t easy because obviously we are living in someone else’s house and trying to abide by their living styles. My wife and step mom weren’t vibing well because my step mom said she didn’t contribute around the house like everyone else and was lazy. After about 3 months total we ended up moving out and into a house we bought together.After about a month in the house her father flew up with her niece to stay and visit. Well coronavirus hit and they ended up staying for a month and a half because they couldn’t get flights back. It was fine, but we weren’t very intimate while her father was here. I expected that. Anyways her father finally finds a flight back, but her niece ends up staying here for a couple months so we can watch her while her father works. I agreed to it, but it did put some stress into our marriage. Nothing seemed wrong though. We still weren’t fighting and just seemed like we were working through things together.Well about three weeks ago my wife sits me down and says she is unhappy and doesn’t fee in love, but she loves me. She feels like we are just great roommates and can get stuff done. She doesn’t like that we aren’t intimate and she feels like she we just don’t have a romantic connection. I’m puzzled because I addressed that shortly after we were married and when I brought that up she said she just didn’t realize it until now. On top of that I am always taking her out on dates and spending time with her. So it wasn’t like I neglected that romantic part of our relationship. So we agreed to get some marriage books and try that. If that doesn’t work move to counseling.We got the books about a week ago. I’ve been reading and learning new things to apply, but when I talked to her about things we can try she gets defensive and says things like “you think you’re the guru now” and when I asked her if she has read any of the book she said she hasn’t been reading. She said she doesn’t even feel like fixing things. She doesn’t know what she wants to do. I keep telling her I can put 110% percent into this, but if she doesn’t put any effort into it our marriage will continue to fail.I’m just so confused. I have been working so hard and putting forth so much effort. I work from home, I do 80% of the house work, cook the meals, take care of our niece, take care of the pets, pay the bills, read through these marriage books, and still make time for her when she gets home to try and fulfill her needs. I don’t know what else to do. Can someone give me guidance? I feel like I am being a great spouse, but am I just blind to my own short comings? I really want to fix it and will do whatever it takes.Thank you for taking time to read through all this and help!Tldr: Wife doesn’t feel in love with me anymore. I’ve been trying to fix this, but it doesn’t seem to be working. What can I do?213 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
nsbhlr,1.4kPosted by4 months agoComments are locked2My (36M) family is upset I'm 'prioritizing' my BIL over my niece after my sister (27F) cheated.
              
            [new]My sister 'Mary' (27F) met her husband 'Tom' (29M) when she was attending college out of state and he was stationed near her campus with the Army. After he got out she dropped out of school so they could move to our homestate at her request so we've been the only family he's had here. They have a 3 year old daughter 'Jane'. Not long ago a guy, call him Bill, reached out to Tom on FB and told him that he saw my sister has a 3 year old kid and that there's a possibility my niece may be his child. He and my sister had been having an affair from the time they moved home until shortly after she found out she was pregnant. He had to move away for work and my sister never mentioned the pregnancy to him, or that she was married. Tom confronted Mary and eventually she admitted to the affair. Two paternity tests later, it was confirmed my niece is not Tom's child. He has been devastated. Bill wants to be in Jane's life, but my sister and family are staunchly against this. They say Jane already has a dad, Tom.Tom has been going to counseling since biodad first reached out to him, and he just cannot see Jane the way he used to or be around her, or talk about her, without breaking down. He says it hurts too much and he feels like his life has been based on a lie, nor can he really imagine staying in her life with Bill around.  Since they separated, I have been letting Tom stay at my place since he has no family here. My sister thinks I'm out of line letting Tom stay and that I'm depriving my niece of her uncle. She doesn't want Jane here so long as I'm supporting Tom, fair I guess..and Tom has offered that he would go to friends' or out if I wanted to babysit or spend time with my niece. Also fair.Personally, I sympathize with Tom. I'm not an affair baby, but my mother was pregnant with me when she met my siblings' father. He made the stipulation that he'd stick around but my bio-dad and biofamily could not be around, and my mother agreed. He treated me differently once my sister and brothers were born, and even more so after he and my mother divorced. My paternal family reached out eventually and I learned the truth, and I got to know them. This pissed off my 'adopted' dad to no end, and his family as well. Said it was a slap in the face that I would even want to know my other family. They were my family and it was ungrateful of me to forsake all of that. I don't want my niece to possibly go through that...getting stuck between families is the worst.So I've been helping Tom find out more about Bill and mediating between them when they talk. Bill seems like a real stand up guy with positive people around him, and wants to take my sister to court for custody, and BIL as well to get taken off the birth certificate. I support both of them in these decisions and have offered to help if they need it. My sister is mad at me but I have told her and our family that she should only be mad at herself, none of this would even be happening even she hadn't played Eenie Meenie Miney Mo with her kids' dad.My family thinks I am prioritizing Tom and Bill over my own niece, that I should be shaming him for abandoning his daughter, and that I am turning my back on her, but, I don't think I am. I also think that Tom deserves some kind of support through all of this. I could really use some outside perspective, is this really an wrong stance for me to take? Or should I back off because my family is right about Tom needing to stick around and shun Bill?UPDATE:  I'll address a few concerns/questions that popped up before my mini-update.Yes, Bill knows Jane is his. When Tom got his paternity test done, he and Bill had him go separately to be tested.Why am I letting Tom stay with me? Well..he was family for years and for me, you don't just chuck family onto the streets except for extreme situations. Divorce takes a year in my state and Tom is opting to stay to make sure it can all be handled quickly and smoothly to get it finalized as soon as possible. That said, he plans on moving back to his homestate after that so I am letting him stay with me so he can save money for his move and moving expenses. Otherwise, the only places he could afford on his own require 6 and 12 month leases.Supporting Tom and Bill may result in my sister and I having little to no contact. True, it may, and that'll be our crosses to bear but I can't find it in me to ignore others needing help just to satiate her and excuse her behavior. I still love my sister, whatever my feelings or opinions of what she did or is doing have no place in this, nor is it really the time for me to go expressing them to her. Bill's lawyer says its very likely Bill will wind up with a custody arrangement and he has assured me that if things do go south with my sister that she won't let me see my niece, I'd always be welcome to visit them to see her during his time with her.Its not a huge update but rather surprising. My sister is still being cranky and doubling down, doing all she can to guilt Tom into reconciling and adamant about Bill not being involved because 'she has a husband that just needs to realize they can work through this, Tom is Jane's dad and Bill is not needed'. So..meh there. Last week I went on a fishing trip with both Tom and Bill for the three of us to just relax and forget all this nonsense for a bit. Once we got back my mother showed up to try talking to me about why I am doing any of this.Surprisingly, we had a decent talk after some heated tension. I wound up showing her the post and while she wasn't happy I was airing our laundry, it helped a bit. Ultimately I was able to get it through to her that given the circumstances and the high probability Bill is going to be a presence in Jane's life from here on out, the best thing for Jane would be if our family and Bill could at least co-exist. I asked her how she would feel if her granddaughter was constantly having to choose who to spend time with for birthdays, graduation, prom pictures, etc, or gods forbid, we all put her in a position that she would have to lie to everyone about what she wanted just to not hurt feelings. It took a while but that seemed to at least get through to her a bit. She's still not happy about the whole situation, but she did agree to a dinner in a public place to meet Bill and some of his family and I'm happy to say that that wound up going off really well and Bill's mother had a good heart to heart with her. So, some progress. Thanks again everyone for the support.TLDR: My sister cheated on her husband and her kid isn't my BIL's. I have been giving support to my BIL by letting him stay with me and seeking legal aid, and also support the biodad in seeking a custody arrangement making my family mad at me and telling me to butt out and support my niece and sister.99 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
nk00cy,1.3kPosted by5 months agoHe (28M) called off his engagement after I (27F) saved his life.
              
            DatingI met my boyfriend when I found him barely conscious in a wrecked car. While we waited for help to arrive, I started rambling because I didn’t want him to lose consciousness. After the ambulance took him away, I kept wondering if he was okay, but I had no way to find out.He ended up finding me on Facebook 3 months later. Despite the weird start, our relationship has been going really well. We’re extremely different but it seems to work for us.2 days ago, I received a message from a woman who claimed to be his fiancée from before the accident. She accused us of having an affair and told me I ruined her life. I knew he was engaged at one time and that it ended, but I didn’t know it ended so recently after we met.I asked him and he told me that he ended it after I saved him because it wasn’t right for him to marry her when all he could think of was a different woman. He did say there was no overlap between our relationship and theirs, he said he didn’t even reach out to me until they had been broken up for a month.The purpose of the post and what I need advice for is that she’s now asking me to meet up with her so she can get closure/compare notes. I don’t know if I should.Any advice?TL;DR – My boyfriend broke up with his ex-fiancée after I saved his life. She’s accusing us of having an affair and wants to meet up so I can give her closure.246 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
my0ply,1.3kPosted by6 months agoMy wife (F 43) and I (M 45) Have Been Sleeping Separately for Years; This Has Become A Problem for Her
              
            RelationshipsMy wife and I have been married for about 20 years and have had the typical ups and downs. Recently, though, conflict over sleeping arrangements that began about 7-8 years ago have created a wedge between us.When my wife and I married, she would occasionally snore. It was something I noticed once in awhile but really no big deal.About 7 or 8 years ago, her snoring got to the point where I was essentially not sleeping if I was in the same bed as her. For a number of reasons, however, she was resistant to talking to a doctor about the problem.So simply to avoid exhaustion, I began sleeping on a futon/couch I had in my home office. I honestly didn't mind, and my wife generally seemed to be understanding.After about 4 years of this, my wife's parents were diagnosed with sleep apnea and I kind of forced the issue with her about seeing a doctor and it turned out she also had sleep apnea.She ended up with a CPAP machine that was almost as loud as the snoring, but was able to work with her doctor to find a model that was quieter and that I barely hear.The problem is, though, that over those 4 years before the diagnoses and the year or so of finding a CPAP that was quieter, I became used to sleeping alone and I find it distracting/difficult to sleep with her now even though the original problem is solved.Nothing about my feelings toward my wife have changed, but she interprets this as my rejecting her. I get that, but I genuinely find it difficult to fall asleep now if I am in bed with her after so many years of sleeping alone in the same house.What should I do?TL;DR! - My wife had severe snoring caused by undiagnosed sleep apnea. I ended up sleeping alone for years. I want to continue sleeping separately; she does not. What should I do?EDIT: I just wanted to thank everyone for the extremely thoughtful and helpful responses. There are a ton of great suggestions here that I'll be giving a try.205 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
izin4j,1.2kPosted by1 year agoArchivedI (32f) have become good friends with the lady that comes to clean once a week (50sf). I now don't need her services but I don't want to offend her
              
            Non-RomanticThe lady used to come once a fortnight, now once a week and does 3 hours of cleaning. We have a good chin wag with a coffee before she started and I'd then get back to my own work of being a SAHM to a very difficult baby. Baby is now 2 and a half and has started nursery. The day is now my own! I now have the free time to do the cleaning she did myself. To complicate matters a bit, the standard of her cleaning has decreased of late which has been annoying, but I don't like to tell her how to do her job because we're friends. If she were a stranger then I'd find it all easier. What's the best way to fire a friend?? There's no contract in place about any kind of notice period, but I'm thinking of paying her 2 weeks worth of pay as a gesture of good will. Is it too insensitive to fire her over text? That's how we communicate if it's not in person. I don't think I've ever phoned her. Should I see her in person? Any advice is very welcome.Tl:Dr how do I fire my cleaner who I'm also friends with?EDIT - Thank you so much, everyone, for your responses. Unfortunately, I'm just as confused as I was before, since you all have very different opinions on how to tackle this. I'm sure I'll figure something out. Thank you all the same!79 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted

            Non-RomanticMy daughter's (16F) friend came out a few weeks ago to her family and friends. It has put a bit of a strain on their relationship. I don't know what is happening is going on between them but I try not to pry.She (16F) visited us this week, My husband and I read a lot and have a huge collection of books. We let her pick out a few books. She picked a few thrillers, some LGBTQ+ memoirs and the like. she was happy about it.She posted about it on Instagram. My daughter saw it. She is angry with us for picking her friend's side and that she wanted to read those books. which is surprising as she is not a person who reads a ton of books. Something is really bothering her and she is lashing out.I feel a bit guilty as it is clear something is going on between them and I feel like this act hurt our daughter even though it was meant to show support to her friend. My daughter is constantly making snide remarks about us preferring her friend over her. My husband is just ignoring it and wants us to ignore it too and let her deal with this issue on her own while I have been trying to talk to her about it.TL;DR : Gave a few books to my daughter's friend to show support but my daughter has taken it as choosing her friend's side in an issue.9 commentssharesavehidereport100% Upvoted
lik86r,1.2kPosted by8 months agoArchived4Should I tell my fiance (both mid-30s) that I'm disappointed in my ring?
              
            RelationshipsTL;DR My anti-jewelry fiance gave me a ring that is almost the exact opposite of what I wanted and cost less than his new computer desk after talking about how he was saving for it for a long time.  How do I tell him I am disappointed in the ring and would like to change it?  Or am I just being snobby?It's been a couple weeks now since my fiance proposed, which I am ecstatic about. It was a long time coming, we've been together 4 years. There's some background to the proposal I think is relevant. We've been talking about marriage since our first anniversary and I was getting upset after several years that it wasn't happening. First, and most relevant, he said that he was saving money for a ring and that was why he hadn't proposed yet. Later, he added in that he wanted me to quit smoking before he would propose, but that reason alternated with the money for a ring reason. I was really feeling like he was just making excuses and so was trying to come to terms with the possibility we would just never get married. At Christmas I lost it and broke down in tears because I felt like it would never happen, at which time he told me he had already bought a ring and it was on it's way. I was totally thrilled.The ring came and he... handed me the package it was in. I opened the mailer myself and took the ring out and put it on. He said since I knew it was coming he would forgo the "ceremony" of it all. Not gonna lie, I'm disappointed about that. I don't need a huge display but I really would have liked him to say the words "will you marry me" and put the ring on my finger. But the past is past.The thing is that I'm unhappy with the ring. I actually love it, and for any other occasion I would be thrilled with the ring. But it's just not... an engagement ring. We had talked about what kind of ring I would want, so it wasn't a mystery. I wanted a certain color of gold, and it's a different one. I wanted a certain stone, that's not it. I wanted a couple of different stone shapes, and it's the one that I specified I would never want. On top of all that, it is inexpensive. He spent more on his new computer desk than my ring. All those times he said he was saving for a ring are just... a lie. We both make very decent money and he had some debt to pay but is in a really good spot financially, just like I am. The ring isn't necessarily cheap looking but combine all the factors and I am just disappointed.On top of that, he is extremely against buying jewelry and has said multiple times that the only jewelry I'll ever get is going to be my engagement ring. This is the one and only thing I'll ever have that I will wear on my person that says "I love you" from him, and it just feels like so little.I waited until I'd calmed down a bit and spent some time reflecting and I'm now unsure about whether or not I should say anything. One thing that I think may make me feel a bit better is to upgrade the to the stone/cut that I want instead of getting a wedding band, but I feel like I can't suggest that without admitting that I am disappointed in the ring as is, and in a lot of ways I feel like a snob being unhappy with it. What should I do? Should I suggest upgrading the ring and hope he doesn't read too much into it or do I need to explain? Am I just being a big old snob that I don't have a traditional engagement ring and I need to get over it?670 commentssharesavehidereport92% Upvoted
ltq6pp,1.2kPosted by8 months agoArchivedComments are lockedMy fiance (30f) and I (36m) are having serious issues after her sister interfered with my family's issues.
              
            [new]Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.My fiance I and I have been together  3 1/2 years, engaged for 18 months and getting married in May.  I thought things were wonderful, but we have hit a major problem. I work in thebshipping industry and was away from home for the majority of this.Sorry for the long post, got alot of background that led to this.A little background, my sister and fiance were best friends through our relationship. I'm very close with my sister and my parents. My fiance is very close with her sister, and we thought of everyone as our own families.    Recently this last year, my sister left her mentally abusive husband for another guy.  Her new guy has a bad past and criminal record, and rightfully so everyone is skeptical of the guy.    But my sister's relationship with her new boyfriend is a whole other thing, that I'm not gonna get into,not my business as long as she is safe and happy.Since she has been with this new guy, my fiance has been very vocal about her opinion of him, that he is a criminal.  This has put a strain on their friendship of course.A little over 3 weeks ago, while going over wedding planning my fiance told me she did not want my sister's boyfriend at any of our wedding festivities.  She said she was going to approach my sister about it.  A few days later, she was afraid to and asked me to confront her about this.  I told her I would handle it.  Knowing this request would hurt my sister's feelings, I asked my mom for advice on how to handle the situation and how best to approach my sister about this.  My mother became upset over it, and was afraid that if I asked my sister this it would hurt my relationship with my sister. I knew it would hurt feelings, but I wanted to try and find a compromise somewhere in all this.After the conversation with my mom, I told my fiance how it went, and that it upset my mom. I wanted to give everyone time to cool off, as we still have 3 mpnths til wedding date. I asked my fiance please be patient as this was not an easy subject to approach.   My fiance was none to happy about my mom's reaction, and was upset as well. Later that night, my fiance and her sister had a long facetime call, and vented to her about her frustrations.  (This becomes a problem later)A few days pass, unbeknownst to me, my mom had a chat with my sister and agreed to not bring her boyfriend. At this point, they hadn't told either my fiance or I about it. Then my sister's ex-husband receives an anonymous message on Facebook telling him how my sister cheated on him,and left him for a criminal. It was full of half truths and assumptions, and coincidentally the few truths it included, were things my sister had only ever told 2 people, my mom and my fiance. Once the ex husband told my about the message, shit hit the fan.Next day, I was unaware of the anonymous message, until my fiance told me she had to tell me something.  She told me that her sister sent an anonymous message to my sister's ex husband telling him what she thought was the "truth".  Fiance says she only vented to her sister and that her sister took it upon herself to tell the ex-husband.  The message included things that were only told to my mom and fiance, so of course #1 suspect was my fiance as the culprit of the message, but no one thought she was capable of this.I told my fiance it would be best if her sister confessed and cleared finances name.  She was upset over it all, but agreed and talked to her sister.The next morning, I awoke to a shitstorm of a group text. Fiance's sister confessed in a group chat including mysepf,myself, fiance,my sister and my mother.  She confessed and explained herself, and as you can expect there were a few heated words at first, but it seemed like things were being cleared up.  That was until my fiance decided that was a good idea to get drunk and tell everyone off.  Well then it became just my fiance telling my mom and my sister how horrible they are in this whole ordeal and how much my fiance hated my sister's boyfriend. It went on for a couple hours of texts. I woke up the next morning to find out about all this. At first I was confused and upset trying to figure out what happened and trying to keep peace between my family and fiance.  She thinks I took my family's side and not her side, when I was on her side until she had the drunken outburst. My fiance even so much as laughed about my family being upset.   This was 2 weeks ago, to the day. Over the next week we didnt talk much. A few heated words, but we agreed to give it time to cool off and try to approach this level headed.  After a week, unknown to me, my mom came by to try and talk with my fiance over things. Fiance was in driveway leaving for work when my mom came by, and told her she couldn't talk right then.  Later that night, fiance sent an angry barrage of texts to my mom blaming my mom for everything.  I have a sneaking suspicion that fiance was drunk again during this.As I work on ships, I was out of town. I had gotten off work early specifically to come home and work things out, as it's difficult to do these things while away for so long.  This was 11 days after the anonymous message, and I was at the airport on my way home. At this point, I thought things were calming down, and we might be able to talk it out calmly. I received several texts from fiance about how she refused to pick me up at the airport, and wanted to stay in the guest bedroom when I got home.   My parents ended up picking me up at the airport, that was when I found out about the angry texts fiance had sent my mom the night before.I arrived home, and had a sit down chat with fiance finally 3 dats ago.    From what she says, she has no regret and refuses to apologize for the way she acted. She sincerely thinks that her sister was right in sending the anonymous message.   We both agreed to stop talking about it for the day, before one of us gets to upset and prevent it from turning into a yelling match.  It's been 3 days, and we've hardly spoken to each other in the house.Myself, I cant stand by and let someone intentionally hurt my family. I have talked with my family about it, they are willing to give fiance another chance on my behalf.  My fiance says she refuses to be anywhere near my family and thinks I have chosen their side, while I've been trying to keep peace between everyone.TL;DR Fiance's sister sent anonymous message to my sister's exhusband, started huge family feud with my relationship hanging I'm the balance.Is there someway I can approach this, and still keep both my family and fiance?55 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
jjb1nr,1.2kPosted by1 year agoArchived23I (17F) Don’t Like My Step Mom (52F) and I Need to Fix That
              
            Non-RomanticWhen I was 12 my mother passed away from complications of the flu. My dad (54M) was left with four kids to raise on his own. I am the oldest and my younger siblings are currently 8F, 9M, and 10M. They were 3, 4, and 5 at the time. My dad was overwhelmed and very busy after it happened, and because I was the oldest and was the only one who understood what was going on, I stepped up. It has been my job since to make sure the younger ones got out of bed on time, make sure they ate breakfast, make sure they were ready to go to the bus stop on time, help my sister with her hair in the morning, make sure there was something on the table for the little ones to eat if my dad couldn’t make it home for dinner, make sure they’re in bed at their bedtimes, etc. I never felt bad for what I had to do. I always felt like I was doing my part in the new family unit to keep everything running. I didn’t think anything of it; I was doing what needed to be done.  I was still allowed a social life and got time with friends outside of school when I wanted to, obviously, I just had more responsibility.My dad first started dating my stepmom three years ago and they have been together since. My dad asked us kids if we would be okay with him dating, and we all gladly gave our permission because he deserved to be happy again. They got engaged last winter and got married at the beginning of the summer (with our blessing). After they were married, she officially moved in and I’ve hardly been able to stand her even though I used to like her. She has stepped in and started helping out on all my household duties and managing the younger ones. When I wake up for school in the morning, I come down stairs now to see that she has already gotten the little ones out of bed and has breakfast on the table. I haven’t had to make anyone a single meal. No more driving my siblings to their friends’ houses. I know she is trying to be helpful and I am happy that I’ll be able to go away to college next year knowing that my siblings will be taken care of, but I feel like my toes are being stepped on and my position in the family is being taken away from me and it makes me detest her. On top of that, seeing her make herself at home in the bedroom my mom and dad once shared and drink coffee from mugs I remember my mom using makes my blood boil. I make a point to spend as little time around her as possible.Since she’s moved in, I’ve been cold and oftentimes cruel to her. I know I can’t detest her forever-she is my stepmom after all-and she’s  not going anywhere. What makes the situation more infuriating is I know I’m being irrational. She’s a kind woman who treats my dad and siblings well. I have no reason to dislike her as much as I do. I’ve tried to force myself to like her but it won’t work. Is there anything I can do to try and get over this intense dislike of her?TL;DR: I have an intense, irrational, dislike of my step mom and I know I need to get over it. I don’t know how to go about doing that, though.98 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
iyggux,1.1kPosted by1 year agoArchived34I (26M) asked my girlfriend’s (25F) friend to stop messing with his girl on our double date. Now my girlfriend is upset with me and I’m not sure how to handle this whole situation. What do I do?
              
            RelationshipsI’m sorry, I realize the title may be a bit confusing. The other day my girlfriend and I went on a date with a couple that she is friends with. I’ve met them a few times, but I don’t know them that well. My girlfriend was hoping that we would all hit it off so that we could do stuff with them more. We first all went to grab dinner. It was okay. We got along fairly well. I did notice that the way he treated her was really rude and ugly though. He would point out things that she did and called her stupid a lot. I know when couples are joking and this didn’t seem like that. My girlfriend and I will occasionally mess with each other. That wasn’t what this was. He had a fun time putting her down and there was no enjoyment from her. It was awkward. She looked so sad and embarrassed. After dinner we went to some bars. She went to order a drink and he said “no, no. I’ll order for you. You always are flirting with the bartender. I don’t trust you.” He ended up ordering her a coke while everyone else had cocktails. She looked miserable.After he had a few drinks he was behaving even worse. He was grabbing and trying to kiss her when it was clear that she wanted nothing to do with it. She tried to walk away but he didn’t let her. He grabbed her wrist and said, “you’re not going anywhere b!tch.” She started looking even more upset to the point where tears were in her eyes. I finally said, “hey let her go, it’s clear that she doesn’t want this. Stop being a jerk.” He got upset and cussed me out for trying to tell him what to do with his girl. I thought he was going to mess with me more but people started noticing him causing a scene so he walked out and grabbed his girl. On the way home I could tell my girlfriend was upset. I finally asked her what was wrong. She explained how she was really embarrassed about what I did and that their friendship might now be ruined. I said I was just trying to help as she looked really uncomfortable. She said that it was none of my business and that she could have handled it herself if she really didn’t like it. I dropped her off and she hasn’t wanted to see me since. I’m worried this may ruin our own relationship in some way.Should I apologize to my girlfriend? I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong but at the same time I understand that she’s upset with me. Should I do something about the girls boyfriend? Do I report him? I’m trying to figure out if my relationship is even worth saving. I feel like my girlfriend should have been supportive of me in this situation. What do I do here? I’m at a loss.TL;DR- I interfered one a double date because the boyfriend was mistreating his girl. Now my girlfriend is upset with me.193 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
j5ajl3,1.2kPosted by1 year agoArchived2My (31F) husband (31M) has been sexting on Facebook and I keep finding more signs of infidelity. I'm 20 weeks pregnant.
              
            InfidelityTogether over 5 years. Married 14 months. We have a 4 year old and are expecting another in February.I've never felt the need to be a hovering wife. I don't go through his phone or anything. I've always trusted him completely. The other morning, I unlocked the iPad, his Facebook was up and I saw a message with someone from the night before. It appears this person was random but it was so easy for him to pull out his d*ck and start masturbating for them in exchange for their videos.Welp, he f*cked up because the person he was talking to scammed him and had recorded his video, telling him they were going to send it to all of his contacts, his job, etc, unless he paid them $3500. He blocked this person and nothing had happened... Yet. He put me and his children at risk of being publicly humiliated in our small town.I feel I had reason to start snooping, so I did. I found an email to reset his password on KiK from the end of June. He denied knowing anything about it for 2 hours then admitted that he did request a password change. He claims he had downloaded the app for porn. I'm not privvy to KiK but I'm pretty sure he would only use this app for sexting. After searching his username online, I also found an account using his distinct username on MeetMe. He swears it's not him. I don't believe a fucking word out of his mouth.I'm disgusted and embarrassed but unsure of what to do next. I think I'm still in shock. I look at our son and don't want him to hurt by divorcing his father. But how can I move on from this absolute disillusion of trust?TL:DR: Husband has been sexting randoms behind pregnant wife's back. Not sure what to do.143 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
nuit3b,1.1kPosted by4 months agoComments are lockedI (30f) didn't see the new baby and now everyone in my husband's (33m) family is mad at me.
              
            RelationshipsUPDATE – Thank you to everyone who responded to my post. Your responses have actually been really helpful. I wanted to update the post to clarify some information:- A lot of people have asked about all the texting. I’m not sure why, my best guess is conflicting schedules, but everyone in this family mainly relies on texting for communication. They don’t answer the phone when you call, but they will respond to texts.- I did let my SIL know that I was sorry I missed them and hope to see them next time they’re in town. I explained that I didn’t find out they were here until the day before the dinner and that wasn’t enough notice for me to reschedule work. I requested that the next time they plan to visit that she send the dates to me so that I can make sure I’m available. She was very understanding and stated that they weren’t worried about it because my husband had told them I was working.- As far as communicating directly with my MIL, if I send her a text, 99% of the time she sends her response to my husband.- To the person who asked if it was my sister, would I have done the same thing? Yes, yes I would have. I wouldn’t have changed anything about what I did. I would have still gone to work and reached out to say I’m sorry that I can’t make it but the short notice didn’t allow enough time to rearrange my schedule. My family would have understood, but they also work in healthcare so they’re aware of what it takes to rearrange a schedule.- If I had to guess what happened, my BIL or SIL probably mentioned in passing “too bad she wasn’t able to come over” and left it at that. My MIL probably picked that up and ran with it until she sent the text message.- No, I’m not close with my husband’s family. He claims to be close with his family, but he doesn’t go out of his way to talk to them or spend time with them. Typically, if we go over for dinner, it’s because it’s a holiday or it’s been a while and we need to make an appearance. I’m definitely not close with my SIL; in the 6 years I’ve been with my husband I’ve probably seen her a handful of times. To put it into perspective, my parents live an hour from us and his parents live 7 minutes from us, but we see my parents 2-3 times more frequently than we do his parents.- To the person who stated that I show no remorse for not seeing my new niece. Do I feel remorse about it? No. I don’t have regret or guilt surrounding my decision to not cancel my patient visits to go see my niece.  If I had been given more notice, would I have made sure that I was able to see her? Yes.- As far as why my MIL is the middle man in all their planning and communications? I have no idea. It’s just how it has been since before I met my husband. MIL plans all the family dinners, plans all the family holidays, passes communication between my husband and his sister. I don’t know why they don’t text directly, but they just don’t.TLDR: I was given 24-hour notice that my SIL, her husband, and their new baby were in town and I was unable to see them due to work. Now that entire side of the family is mad at me and acting like I should have rearranged my entire schedule to be able to see them.I’m going to start this off by saying that my husband and I have a good relationship and it’s pretty normal. I’m not going to call it perfect or fantastic because we have disagreements like any couple and I don’t believe that a “perfect relationship” exists. So, here’s the deal. My husband’s sister and her husband live in a different state and they are both doctors so, they have pretty busy schedules. They came back to visit last week with their new baby that we haven’t seen yet. His mom had been telling us for awhile that they were coming back “sometime” in June, but would never give us specific dates when we asked. I’m not sure why neither of us reached out to his sister to confirm the dates, but we didn’t and we just relied on his mom to provide this information to us. So anyway, they came back to visit Sunday through Saturday morning last week and neither of us knew they were in town. His mom sent us both a text on Wednesday stating “dinner at our house tomorrow night at 5:30. Family friends are coming too. Having burgers, brats, etc. Eating around 6ish.” Which is an innocent enough text, except this was the first time that anything had been said to my husband or I about this dinner that we were expected to attend. He had to contact his mom to find out what this dinner was regarding and why we were expected to attend. That’s how we found out that his sister, BIL, and the baby were in town. So, here’s where the issue occurred. I work in healthcare. Granted, I do home health and I set my own days and hours, but once I have a schedule set with my patients, it’s really hard to get a visit rescheduled within the prescribed window. My days are not typical 8am-5pm days. I frequently am not getting home until 7, 8, or 9 at night and sometimes I’m not home until midnight. I’m frequently driving 2-3 hours one way to see a patient so this makes my days 10-13 hours long on a regular basis. I’m not saying this as a “pity me and my work schedule” thing, I’m stating this to stress how hard it is to reschedule patients due to how much of a time commitment each visit is. So back to the issue. His mom gives us 24-hour notice of this dinner that we’re expected to attend, but I have to work, and it’s one of my 13-hour days. So, I tell my husband that I can’t attend this dinner and I need his mom to provide more notice than 24 hours for things like this. He asks if I can reschedule my patient but I can’t because my schedule is booked for the next 3 weeks. So, he turns around and tells his mom that WE will be there for dinner. I tell him “That’s not what I just told you” and he asks me again to really try to reschedule my patient. I tell him that I have no room to reschedule and contact his mom to let her know that I won’t be able to attend dinner due to work and request that she provide more notice in the future. She just says “okay” and leaves it at that. The dinner happens, I go to work, I come home, and talk with my husband. He states that when he was leaving his mom told him “We’re really sorry that she couldn’t be here, have her stop by tomorrow.” This puts me in the same situation I was in with the dinner. I have an 11-hour day on Friday and I’m not going to be back home until around 9:30 that night; I can’t just drop everything to go see the baby and visiting family. So, I sent his mom a text stating that I wouldn’t be able to make it over the next day due to work, and she didn’t respond. His sister, BIL, and the baby left Saturday morning. Sunday my husband’s mom sends him, ONLY HIM, a text stating “your BIL and sister were hurt Apprehensive-Duck562 didn’t come over to see her niece. BIL actually said something to us. Think how you would feel if you were parents and your only Aunt ignored your child. BIL or sister would not treat either of you like that. Family is family you show up for them.” My husband told me about it and I told him to let his mom know that if she has any issues then she needs to direct them to me but she never responded to his text. Now I’m left with a family that is angry at me that I wasn’t able to see the baby due to work. I have a text response drafted out to his mom but I’m uncertain that I want to send it because I don’t want it to seem like I’m gaslighting her, but at the same time I let everyone know that I had work commitments and I would not be able to just drop in. I’m frustrated that they all expect me to just cancel my commitments and make myself available on short notice. I feel this is a complete disregard and lack of respect for my schedule and my work. On top of it, if the roles were reversed, I know that his sister and BIL would not receive a text like that from his mom because they’re doctors and everyone knows how hard it is for them to get out of work especially on short notice. I’m not ignoring anyone; I just can’t change my schedule on such short notice. I’m not really sure how to resolve the situation. I thought about texting his sister and saying that I was sorry I missed them when they were in town, but I wasn’t made aware of it until 2 days before they left. In the text that I have drafted for his mom I pretty much say everything that I said up above, that I feel disrespected, it’s not reasonable to expect me to rearrange things at a moment’s notice, etc. Am I the bad guy in this situation? I feel like everyone is looking at it one dimensionally and that dimension is that I just didn’t want to see them. When in reality, it’s that I was given really short notice and I was unable to make my work schedule fit. What are your thoughts Reddit?196 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
jxue7u,1.1kPosted by11 months agoArchivedI'm toxic and jealous please help
              
            Personal issuesI (28f) got into a new relationship (27m) with a guy I've known my entire life. We've only been officially dating a couple weeks, but I want to solve this before my toxicity ruins it.I've always been a jealous and possessive girlfriend. I don't know why. I feel very confident and happy. I always get these thoughts that people (I get these thoughts with friends too) are going to betray me. I have a massive fear of being cheated on. I've never been cheated on.Like I said I've known this guy since elementary school. I trust him. I know he's a good guy. Last night he was hanging out with a group of friends and snapped me two photos with his female friends in the pictures. I also know these females, maybe not very well, but I don't think they have bad intentions. Yet I still got annoyed. Yet I still struggled with obsessive thoughts.I don't want to be this way. I want to encourage friendships. I've never really been able to have platonic male friendships because they always end up wanting more from me. I'm not sure if that has something to do with it.Does anybody have advice for me? I'd greatly appreciate it. I don't understand why it hurts me because I can logically rationalize yet it's like my emotional side is a completely different person inside of me.I'm sure I could use some counseling although I don't really have the money for that at the moment. I just want to be an emotionally stable, good, supportive girlfriend. I don't think there's anything wrong with male/female friendship but in the back of my mind it's telling me there is. Aaaah!! I don't like it when emotions are stronger than logic.I greatly appreciate anybody's kind words or advice. I'm at a loss here. Thank you.Tdlr: I'm jealous and I hate it. I want my boyfriend to have female friends and be happy for him.128 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
niaodc,1.1kPosted by5 months ago4My (25f) maid of honor (25f) just told me she isn't coming to my wedding. How do I handle this without creating resentment?
              
            [new]I technically got married last summer but our celebration got pushed to this fall. I've known my MoH for ~6yrs. MoH and her gf have been together just over 2yrs.For background info, I recently found out my pregnancy (11 weeks along) was not viable and I had told my maid of honor this. She knew I would be miscarrying soon. Additionally, this week I was dealing with a lot of stress and pressure from family members due to unrelated wedding planning issues I was running into dealing with hotels.So during this especially stressful week, I ended up in the hospital for a few hours due to miscarrying and the next day called my maid of honor to update her on what happened and my wedding planning issues.Before I was able to get into anything, she says she's sorry, but she isn't coming to the wedding anymore. Says her girlfriend's relative is having a birthday party the same day and she needs to be there to support her girlfriend since the relative isn't doing so well.Obviously, I've already had a rough week so I struggled with a response. This isn't exactly the first time she's flaked on me (usually small stuff like "I can't hang out, I have a huge paper I didn't start yet"). I've helped her through a lot of stuff in the past and I feel like she's completely ditching me the one time I really need her. I never had the chance to tell her what I was dealing with because she just went right into telling me she wasn't coming. I was a little flabbergasted at her excuse as well.On one hand, if I just let it be, I feel like I will always hold some resentment at the fact my maid of honor ditched me to go to a birthday party and dropped that on me literally as I was miscarrying.But if I say I'm hurt by her decision and rather she came to my wedding, then I'm the asshole who forced her to not be able to support her girlfriend and she will probably resent me for that.I don't hate her, I'm just hurt and confused by this decision and lack of support with what's been happening with me. I don't know how to say this without creating some form of resentment or casting of blame or accidentally destroying the friendship.TL;DR: Maid of Honor says she isn't coming to my wedding because she has to accompany her girlfriend to a relative's birthday. How do I handle this without creating animosity?Edit: I've read all the replies so far. A lot of people are making huge assumptions which I figured would happen. There's no weird relationship between her and my husband, they get along great, all four of us do (me, her, my husband, and her girlfriend). Also, it's not like she bails on me every time we try to hang out, I was more trying to show that she doesn't always think things through and plan ahead (ex. knowing we were going to hang out one weekend and not starting a paper until the night before even when it was assigned a month ago). Also, I'm a very low pressure bride. My bridesmaids have only had to buy their dresses which were within everyone's budget. They literally have zero responsibilities other than to show up to the wedding which I'm providing sleeping/food/drink for the whole weekend for the bridal party.104 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
iiq2im,1.1kPosted by1 year agoArchivedThis has been the hardest year and a half of my (F30) life. And now, my soon-to-be ex husband (M30) has given me another issue to grapple with
              
            BreakupsTl;dr. My ex and I are almost divorced with custody and visitation sorted out, but now he’s moving to a different province with his pregnant girlfriendI (F30)left my soon-to-be ex husband (M30) in March of 2019. We were living in Canada with our 2 year-old son (M4 now). It was a long time coming and my ex knew that. I wasn’t absolutely perfect, but I truly loved him, so being loyal, supportive, affectionate, and honest requires no effort on my end. He was physically and emotionally abusive.I won’t go into extreme detail, but he agreed to give me sole custody if I didn’t ask for more than $100/month for child support. He also let me move back to where my family lives in the States.A few months after my son and I moved back to the States, my ex moved to a different province for a girl and they’ve been together since.With our lawyers, we agreed to the terms of the divorce. My ex had threatened in the past about disappearing with our son, so for physical visitation, we agreed to the following:Every Summer until our son is 8, he and I both will travel to Ontario, which is where my ex lives, for a two-week stay. Our son will stay with my ex and I will stay with my ex’s aunt (she and I are close).But now, there will be some changes.My ex informed me that he and his girlfriend are expecting a baby and will be moving to New Brunswick. He told me that since I can’t stay with his aunt, he and his girlfriend will be looking for a 3-bedroom apartment so that I can stay with them and our son for these two-week stays.I have tried to be a bigger person in all of this. I have been staying with my family since my son and I arrived back in the States. The house is huge and has a mother-in-law quarters. Since we left, I told my ex that he could come see our son literally anytime and use the mother-in-law quarters for full privacy. It can function completely independently of the main house.He hasn’t come to see our son since we left Canada. We do video calls twice a week, so that’s the extent of the contact he has with him.We aren’t even divorced yet. Everything has been filed, but the judge hasn’t signed anything.I’m a pretty easygoing person for the most part, but this new arrangement for the Summer visits has me feeling very uncomfortable. In the agreement we filed with the court, all visitation mentioned Ontario.If I don’t stay with them, my only other option is to stay in a hotel, which I truly cannot afford. I really don’t want to send our son up there by himself either. I’ve been with him every single day since he was born, and especially with COVID, my son cries hard if I have to go somewhere without him. Plus, I can’t ignore the threats my ex made about disappearing with our son, which is why I want to stay close to him until I know he can call me if something happens.I don’t know if there is an ideal solution for these changes. I just needed to type things out.201 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
lwcrx3,1.1kPosted by7 months agoArchivedMe [33F] with my wife [30F]. She is a very frequent verbal processor, and it's becoming more than I can take in.
              
            RelationshipsWife is a verbal processor- always has been and always will be. I'm more the opposite, but still make space to listen to her. With having been locked down for the past year or so, that's led to many many more opportunities for 'verbal dumps'. Especially in the past few months, as her job has been really frustrating, it seems like at least 5 times a day she's telling me something frustrating/annoying/obnoxious/overwhelming about her job.Now, her job is challenging. I know that. And I want to be there for her and let her process. But it's happening SO much- she'll just start going on with, if I'm being totally honest, complaint after complaint and 0 reflection of her role or accountability. I mean that sincerely. It's only ever about other people. And when I try to respond with anything other than "that sounds really hard", then I'm being invalidating and it turns into a row. But I simply don't have the capacity to be talked at this much, and being asked to follow a scripted response of "that sounds really hard".I've brought it up multiple times that it's over capacity for me, and she keeps saying "I know I know, I need to find other people to vent to" but nothing is really changing. If anything, it's getting worse.Am I a total asshole for even trying to set boundaries? Should I just be the sounding board at her beck and call?tl;dr: She's a verbal processor anyway, way more so since lockdown, but it's becoming too much negativity for me and I just feel talked at, not with.129 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
nf36de,1.1kPosted by5 months ago3My [F27] casual boyfriend [M28] was incapacitated in an accident — am I morally responsible for his care?
              
            Non-RomanticI’d been casually seeing a guy for the last couple of months.I was not looking for anything serious but we were having a fun time.Last month, on the way to my apartment, he was in an auto accident that left him severely impaired.It has become apparently in the last couple of days that recovery will be slow and he will be unable to live on his own.I have also learned in this time that he does not have any immediate family or close friends to speak of. (Parents are deceased, sister is a non-functioning alcoholic.)Many of my friends have suggested that because the accident happened while visiting me and because we were in a relationship of sorts, that I am responsible for seeing him through the recovery process.I did not even know how this man spelled his last name until the accident occurred and am severely overwhelmed at the idea of being tied up with him in such a strong, one way, commitment indefinitely.I was not even looking for a serious boyfriend at the time of entering into interactions with him.But I also don’t want my shock and disillusionment at the situation to cloud my judgment where doing the right thing is concerned.What is my responsibility here?I need someone totally emotionally detached from the situation to just give it to me in plain language. Thank you.tl;dr my non-serious boyfriend was severely injured in an auto accident on the way to visit me. He has no one to care for him through the recovery process and I’m wondering what my responsibility is here. I don’t really know him, but I know him more than anyone else in his life right now.228 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
hoeaet,1.1kPosted by1 year agoArchivedComments are lockedMy [24F] boyfriend [25M] is being passive aggressive about my injury since it happened when I was drinking and is also accusing me of "overplaying" my injury
              
            RelationshipsSo on the 4th of July I fell down a couple stairs and fractured my foot. I wasn't super drunk, but I had a few drinks. We had plans to go out of town the following day but had to cancel. Immediately I could tell he was upset and I apologized for ruining our plans. He said it wasn't the fact I got hurt, but I was being irresponsible and fell. I told him again, I was sorry but I wasn't even drinking that much. However, I don't drink often and when I do, I get buzzed pretty quickly. Since then, he's been very hostile. He's accused me of overplaying my injury, saying I shouldn't even need a boot for "just a fracture", he doesn't offer to help me with anything so I'm constantly stressing my foot, etc.Overall he's just acting like me being injured is a huge inconvenience to him and I'm overreacting for attention or something. Any time I need help with something or mention anything regarding my foot, he just rolls his eyes. He's never fractured anything or had any kind of injury like that, so I don't think he understands that it's very painful. Yesterday I took my boot off and my foot was really swollen. I asked him to get me ice and he mumbled how I "got myself into this mess by being irresponsible." I asked him AGAIN if he was upset I was drinking or upset we weren't able to go out of town. He said both, and it's "especially frustrating you had us cancel over a minor fracture". I guess I'm not sure what to do at this point. I've apologized for drinking so much that night but I can't change it now. I just can't handle the passive aggressive behavior.TL;DR : Fractured my foot on the 4th of July after I'd been drinking. Boyfriend was upset I was being irresponsible and is also mad we had to cancel plans to go out of town. He also thinks I'm "overplaying" my injury.Update post got locked so here is the final update:UPDATE So first off, I appreciate everyone's advice. I broke up with my boyfriend! I just couldn't get past him not taking my injury and pain seriously and basically blaming me for it. It was really hurtful that I was in pain and he didn't seem to care at all. It was a relatively smooth breakup. There was no arguing or anything. I told him how I felt and all he said was "sorry" but it wasn't a sincere apology. It was more of a "sorry you feel that way."So I'm moving out. I'm in the process of beginning to move all my stuff out which I think is the worst part. It's especially not fun on a broken foot! My aunt and uncle live about 40 minutes away and they are more than happy to let me stay with them while I look for a place.Again, I really appreciate everyone's advice. I'm happy with the outcome and think it was for the best. If he couldn't take me seriously now, I don't think i could ever trust him to take me seriously or be supportive in a medical situation again.106 commentssharesavehidereport100% Upvoted

There are many reasons I don’t, up to and including I don’t want to put financial pressure on myself, there are more things I wanted to do before I have a child, and I don’t want my child to be in a collapsing world. It’s too uncertain. My husband’s sister just announced she is pregnant, which turned my husband’s mind towards babies. Previously, we had been of an accord that we didn’t want babies and we were okay not having them.

ipn9d3,1.1kPosted by1 year agoArchivedComments are lockedAfter months of fighting (M/24) with my gf (F/24), I moved back home for a bit and had a nervous breakdown from the stress and I found out my mom (F/60) actually despises my gf and showed me some things about her that I can't unsee. Can this relationship even be salvaged?
              
            RelationshipsI suffer from some mental illness that causes me to have a nervous breakdown when I'm under severe stress and I'm in therapy to handle this. My parents and girlfriend, Annie, all know about my condition. During the whole relationship, my mother treated Annie like a daughter and never said anything negative about her when we were alone. But I could tell she did not like Annie at all.I have been with Annie for about 2.5 years now, we've been living together for the past year and I was preparing to pop the question at the end of this year. The last few months have...not been good. I've been dealing with stress from work, we're being asked to find a new place to live within the next 6 months and Annie lost her job due to COVID. So all of these things were already causing some friction in our relationship.As much as I love Annie, she has a nasty habit when she's pissed. Like when she's in a bad mood, if the smallest thing doesn't go her way things compound and her temper flares and she doesn't let things go. I've tried asking her to go to therapy and she says she's fine. We've had a few arguments about a few major things (nothing to do with infidelity) over this time (50/50 fault) and a ton of arguments about minor crap because she was still mad about the major things. After like the 14th argument over the last few months, this time about something so minor, I had enough and went home to give her some space. After a day or so I tried calling her to talk things out and she was still mad about that minor thing and still mad about the thing before that and the thing before that. All this compounding stress and the general feeling of shame of not being able to make Annie happy caused me to have a nervous breakdown in front of my family. Also Annie does not take criticism very well and is unwilling to change.My mother is a psychologist, so after seeing my have my breakdown she had me explain what was wrong to try and help. So, I ended up explaining the real reason I came back home. After my explanation, my mom revealed how much she disliked Annie and how I could do better. She then listed out every red flag she saw with Annie since the start of the relationship but never told me because of how happy I was. She also told me that my relationship with Annie was like her friend's marriage which ended in a nasty divorce and also how closely my relationship matched my best friend's relationship which ended up with his SO walking out on him.I came back home on Monday and Annie seems to be more relaxed and over what made her mad. After watching her for the last 3 days, I noticed all the red flags my mom pointed out and am now terrified that marrying Annie is the wrong choice. I saw my friend's relationship disintegrate before my eyes and I never really noticed how much my relationship with Annie matched his. Annie's out shopping while I write this and I'm sitting on our bed rethinking this whole thing. Is there any way our relationship can be salvaged? Should I ask Annie to try and change?tl;dr: After months of fighting on and off with my girlfriend over some serious things (nothing to do with infidelity) and over some seemingly minor things, I moved back home for a break and the stress caused me to have a nervous breakdown in front of my parents and I revealed the nature of our fights.

mjp05x,1.1kPosted by6 months agoArchived3I feel deceived about my husband's finances, and it's a huge strain on our marriage.
              
            [new]TL;DR I'm in my 34(F) and feel, for lack of a better term, "stuck" in my second marriage 35(M). I have been married for 4 years and I pay for, and hold the responsibility for, everything with no real effort on the part of my husband.I was married in my early 20s, he was physically and emotionally abusive and it was hell for 4 years. When I finally left, I got 2 jobs and rebuilt my whole life back from scratch. I hustled hard for a couple years. I bought my own place at 27 and spent time being single, dating and building a solid career. By the time I met my husband, I felt like I was ready to give a relationship a chance. We moved in together after a few months into his rental and I leased out my condo (thought being that if we broke up, I could easily move back into my home). Everything was great. After a few more months, his twin brother who was down on his luck ended up crashing in our spare room for several months - didn't pay rent, ate all our food and didn't clean up after himself. It drained me financially trying to keep everyone's heads above water (trauma made me a people pleaser). Their mother is a wealthy well-to-do entrepreneur, but here I was supporting her son.At the time, my then bf told me he made the same amount of money as me as a successful sports coach. I trusted him, why would anyone lie about that, right? To rid ourselves of his brother, we decided to move into my condo and we ended up getting engaged. All totally normal. Because all the mortgage and bills were in my name, we agreed that he would put some money into my account every month and it would settle fair enough. I kept getting uncomfortable with asking each month, but I also got a rather huge promotion so money wasn't really a factor and it wasn't worth arguing over a few hundred bucks a month when I had it covered.After we got married, I suggested we move to a house out of the city. He was keen with this, and we started shopping. My broker gave us a number which we could shop with based on our incomes (my actual, his estimated). I was set to make a really good amount on selling the condo so that would be a massive down payment. However, when our broker started to ask for financial information, it turned out that my husband hadn't done his taxes in several years, and had far more debt than he had let on. I was furious! When I started peeling back the layers of the onion, he made far less than minimum wage with his "business" and owed over $15K in other debt. I felt betrayed and was ready to end it there and then - debt is one thing, lying is another. After many days of arguing, we determined that I would pay off all the debt and start with a clean slate at the new home and try to move forward.The house came with a higher monthly cost - we agreed he would contribute $1000, and I would contribute $2000 which would cover all monthly bills and a buffer left over. I made more, I could afford more and it seemed fair. He has contributed his portion merely 11 times in those 3 years. When he does chip in, he wants a parade as if he is doing some huge favour. Over those 3 years, we have had the same conversation over and over - he buys things for him, but doesn't put any money into the account for bills, ever. Even when I ask, he says he will and then doesn't. He can afford his beer, his weed, his sports equipment and buying the high-end branded stuff, where as I am sitting here budgeting how the hell I am going to pay the home insurance or get my car fixed. What he does earn, he keeps to himself. It is not like he doesn't know the cost of our living, I often talk about the bills and monthly output and how much of a struggle it is but it falls on deaf ears. I have tried writing out and working through budgeting with him. I have tried setting calendar reminders in his phone to make a payment (he is not comfortable with setting up auto-payments he says). We were trying for a baby, but when I started to realize that he couldn't possibly help support us while I was on mat leave, and that he makes less than child care costs a month, I said we needed to stop trying. I have tried approaching this money topic in many different ways and none of them work.At this point, I am working 60 hours a week and studying at the same time. I hate my job but can't leave because it pays well, helps with my education and keeps a roof over our heads. He kind of works, but COVID has meant his industry (athletics/sports) has been hit and miss with consistency this last year. He isn't really qualified for anything else as he has been working in this field for 15 years and didn't finish university. He hasn't made any effort to backfill his losses, and has laid around alot playing video games. He seems really happy with me subsidizing his life. We have had many conversations about it, to the point that I was getting anxiety attacks worrying about how the hell to keep a roof over our heads. He hasn't made any effort to meet me in the middle, he listens, but does nothing. He could very easily pick up a hammer as he has done in his younger years. I remind him of what it was like when his twin lived with us, it is the same - like a teenager laying around and lying when he's called out. I recently learned that when we met, his mom was helping with his rent... a 30 year old man. I feel so deceived. After all the trauma of the past marriage, I had hoped the "nice guy" would be the best for my future happiness and emotional/physical safety. I was so wrong.Whenever I have raised the issue, he immediately jumps into the "I'm struggling, I am depressed" but has never taken up the multiple counselling resources we have available and says he doesn't trust therapists (WTF?!). I am so turned off being intimate, I recoil. He no longer makes me laugh. I can barely respond when he tries to be endearing. Our last conversation was 3 weeks ago - I told him this was my last straw, I am not happy and this constant conversation is exhausting and unfair. I don't see any way out of this until he hits rock bottom but I worry about his mental health. What is even more infuriating is that after paying all of the bills, paying off his car, buying our home and everything else in between, if we did divorce, he would get half of everything I have worked my ass off for without lifting a finger. I don't want to lose my house - it is my dream home. I didn't ask for a prenup because I really didn't think I had to - but I am kicking myself.Is there another approach I should try?I feel that I know what the answer is, but I need some help getting there without feeling tremendous guilt and shame.341 commentssharesavehidereport95% Upvoted

            Personal issuesI have what I consider to be a good healthy relationship with my wife.For some reason though, I recently am unable to stop thinking about a girl I dated 16 years ago, for the entirety of a month. The relationship was normal for 2 20 year olds. We liked to low key hangout, and have lots of sex.The relationship ended abruptly one day. She and I hung out with a group of people on Saturday night, did our normal at home thing, then got up Sunday and went to a friend's college graduation party. Then, as I remember it, she seemed super distant, and just up and left. That was the end of it.I remember at the time I took the breakup really hard. Called off work 3 days, got super drunk, cried to my friends.The other night I had a dream about her, and in the dream I kept calling her "the one that got away". I know that isn't true in any sense of the word. We definitely both went completely different directions in life as far as I know. I dont really know much about her, as we completely stopped talking at the end of our relationship, and never stayed friends.Ever since that dream, I have been rehashing those 4-5 weeks, 16 years ago, over and over again in my mind. It's driving me nuts.I am not sure how to bring this up to my wife, or even if I should mention it. I've read a few self help articles saying this all really points to me just never getting closure on the relationship.Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.tl;dr: Can't stop thinking about girl I dated 16 years ago. No contact with her in 16 years. Should I discuss with my wife? Advice on dealing with this?14 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
isigqa,1.1kPosted by1 year agoArchivedUPDATE:How do I (24F) tell my boyfriend (29M) that his constant texting with his attractive coworker (27F) is making me uncomfortable?
              
            Updateshttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ihejmw/how_do_i_24f_tell_my_boyfriend_29m_that_his/Hey guys, so since my last post things actually improved a little bit.After a long sit down with my boyfriend he finally understood that it's not about me mistrusting him and its about the fact that I was feeling neglected in the relationship, so he apologized and promised he'd set clear boundaries with her and he'll be more attentive in the relationship. Obviously I was so happy to hear him say that and I felt relieved and he ended up telling her that I'm uncomfortable with them texting all the time and and I don't know what happened between them exactly but he later told me they're gonna stop texting completely (at that point I realized that my speculation was probably correct when I thought that she was into him) but regardless I was glad to be done with the whole thing and ready move on and everything was going well until we had a fight about a week ago.It was a completely unrelated issue but anyway we got into a fight and he ended up leaving our place, we were so mad at each other so it took us a couple of days to make up. At that point I had assumed he stayed at a friend's house so I didn't ask him where he stayed. But a couple of days ago I see a text from her on his phone, she wanted to make sure he didn't forget anything at her place. I went crazy after I saw that text (especially because I thought they stopped texting) I immediately confronted him about it and he said that he did stay at her place but she was out of town and she just lent him the place. Now I made some calls to some mutual friends and I found out that it is true that she was out of town but it's still odd that she gave him keys to her place despite the fact that they supposedly weren't talking for the past 2 weeks. He denies talking to her at all and he said that she only happened to call that night and that she was just checking up on him and he ended up telling her we fought so she invited him over lent him the keys and then went on her trip, and he swears that's what happened.I don't know why but the whole thing sounded fishy to me, I have no idea why he chose to stay at her place over any of his other friends (he claims because she was out of town and he'd have the place to himself) but I'm having a hard time believing him and I don't know what to do nowTLDR- My boyfriend and I had a fight and he ended up spending the night at his widowed coworker's place, he claims she was out of town and nothing happened but I'm doubting him because they supposedly haven't been talking for 2 weeks.232 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
ja7ie5,1.0kPosted by1 year agoArchivedComments are lockedMy (19F) boyfriend's (20M) mom asked me to break up with him. When I said no, she asked us never to see each other until the pandemic is over because she hopes we break up before then
              
            RelationshipsI've been with my boyfriend for over a year and his mom hated me from the start. Keep in mind that we've never met in-person and we talked for the first time a few days ago. She thinks I'm a bad influence on her son because I come from a poor, traumatic background and have no good family relations. Her opinion of me never got too much in the way until now, when I decided to live in the same city as my college and my boyfriend happens to live 20 miles away.My boyfriend lives with his mom because he's doing school online (pandemic). In July, I went from being 5,000 miles away from him to 60. When he asked his mom about visiting me in August, she was against it but he decided to go against her will and see me for a week as we hadn't seen each other in-person in 6 months. When he got back, his mom was depressed and angry and it affected his mental health badly.A few days ago, he asked his mom if he could visit me every other week once I moved into the new city. His mom then FT'd me asking me to break up with him because she doesn't like me. We had an hour-long conversation but basically, she said she didn't want her son to be in a serious relationship because he's young. She also said she sacrificed everything to come to the U.S. so her son can get a good education and she's disappointed that her son wound up with me. She gaslighted me for most of the conversation, telling me to "think of [her]," saying that I am impulsive and irresponsible for moving to a new apartment, and then using the pandemic as an excuse for me being selfish about wanting to see her son. I say excuse because she asked us not to see each other until the pandemic was over and I asked her if it was because she was worried for her son's health or if it was because she didn't like me. She then said, "Truthfully, it's because I want you to break up."My boyfriend intends to listen to his mom about not seeing me and believes that is the best scenario: his mom will be happy and we can still date. He doesn't want to go through seeing his mom depressed again because he defied her last time. He is optimistic about finding some way around it so we can at least see each other in the spring. Even so, I don't realistically expect to see him until maybe summer, and that's on really limited terms because his mom truly dislikes me. I don't know if I can go through living so close to him but not being allowed to see him for 7+ months.For context, my boyfriend is really close to his mom and they've really only had each other for most of their lives. She's single and divorced twice (I believe) and my boyfriend has said that her happiness depends on him so he's pretty conflicted as well. I will probably send this post over to him so he can see the replies.TL;DR my boyfriend's mom hates me, doesn't want me to see him in-person until COVID's "over," and we're obeying her wishesSo, what should I do? What are my options? I'm not sure if I should stand by my boyfriend's decision, keep fighting to see him, find a different compromise, or walk away.EDIT: for all those asking, they’re Korean.180 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
isl4a2,1.0kPosted by1 year agoArchivedComments are lockedMy husband (29M) is getting bored of me (29F)
              
            RelationshipsHusband and I have been together a long time, over 10 years at this point. We married 5 years ago. We have no children but have brought up trying to conceive in the next few years. We both work and are financially stable.Recently my husband has been voicing stuff that really worries me. We'll be sitting on the couch after work or on weekends, I'll be watching Netflix or on Facebook or something, and he'll be doing one of his projects. He'll ask me stuff like "what happened to all those books you used to read? You used to get so excited about reading." or "what happened to the novel you wanted to write?"I'll explain to him that I don't really have the attention span for reading anymore, and that the novel writing thing was an early 20s dream and goals change. Yesterday he said, in response to this, "I miss us having conversations about our interests and goals." He claims I've been like this before all the pandemic doldrums, which is true, I probably shifted my interests like 2 years ago.My husband has always had hobbies that he pours his time into. Me, not so much. We've never had the same hobbies, ever, but I guess he really used to like me talking about Chaucer and Steinbeck and stuff. Prior to the pandemic we did go on dates together and we had fun with those.I feel like he doesn't understand that people do change over time and the interests I had 10 years ago aren't going to be the same ones I have now. It seems like he's getting bored of me. What can we do about this?tl;dr: My husband misses the hobbies I used to have when I was younger. I've moved on.388 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
mycpq7,1.0kPosted by6 months agoMy [32M] girlfriend’s [32F] feelings about being a burden have actually become a burden...
              
            RelationshipsWe’re in our early 30s and have been together two years, and moved in together a couple months ago.To get the basics out of the way, we love each other very much, are serious about our future together, talk about kids and marriage, the whole nine yards.But she is extremely anxious and insecure about practically everything: her job, her looks, her parents, our relationship, etc etc, with a tendency to get extremely depressed and spiral out of control about relatively minor and mundane things.Most of it stems from a strict religious upbringing that has really damaged her self-worth and sense of relationships, and she has been in therapy for a few years and while it does seem like the frequency and intensity of her anxiety is a bit lower, I can’t say that it actually makes it’s impact on our day-to-day any better.The biggest problem is that she is constantly walking on eggshells to avoid upsetting me, or disagreeing with me, or basically doing anything to upset the delicate balance of everything being totally fine - which it is anyway. I’m pretty easygoing and don’t really get upset, but if there’s ever any situation where something is unclear or if I voice any kind of second opinion, she immediately panics and tries to compromise or radically change plans to make it work (and she does this with everyone).Like, just as an example if she’s at the grocery store, and I text to ask if she can pick up something that happens to be out of stock, she will panic and start looking up nearby stores that might have it or go extremely out of her way to get it, instead of just being like “No, they don’t have it, what about X instead?” which is what I would do.I don’t care about things not working out or changing plans, so when that happens and she panics and starts extremely over complicating the situation to make something work out that neither of us care about at all, THAT becomes unbelievably aggravating.It also has the added side effect of ME having to walk on eggshells and never really voicing disagreement or changing plans because it might send her into a spiral.It was pretty hard before we moved in together, now that we live together it is every day and honestly I’m already at a breaking point where I regret moving in together because of how intense the energy in our apartment is.Another big part of this is that because she is so insecure, she invests a lot of her self worth in the success of our relationship, so when it feels overwhelming and I take a little space for myself, she senses that and gets overbearing about needing attention and reassurance and emotional energy from me, otherwise she’ll get upset and talk about feeling distant or unloved.We talk a LOT about this, we are very open about discussing the impact of her mental health on our relationship, and I know that anxiety and depression are very real, and she is getting help. But we also talk about how this isn’t sustainable, and frankly my opinion is that change requires deliberate attention and work, and every time we talk about it, she’ll say that her next step is going to be focused on self-care, self-affirmation, maybe an ongoing physical activity to give herself something to look forward to... and so far, two years in, I haven’t seen it happen.Honestly, I love her but I also feel like I’ve hit a breaking point, I’m not really happy living together, I’ve had to compromise on a lot and give up a pretty idyllic life living alone which I loved, and the idea of doing this same thing for the rest of my life simply feels impossible without serious changes on her end. But I also feel like I’m coming to terms with the fact that she might just be like this for the rest of her life, and I simply can’t live like this forever.At the same time, I can’t imagine breaking up with someone I love who also is desperate and fully invested in spending the rest of her life with me (and is also panicked about getting too old to have children which is probably the biggest thing she wants out of her life).The worst part is that I can’t possibly break up with her for her mental health because I can’t think of a scenario that would be more damaging and traumatic for her - she has said MANY times that ruining the relationship because of her mental health is her biggest fear, which ironically is obviously a self-fulfilling prophecy. And obviously, I LOVE HER! So breaking up over this feels insane even though it’s such a massive presence in our relationship.We’ve talked about her doing different therapy, trying medication (which she doesn’t want to do, but would do for ME, which is... beyond wrong imo), we tried couple’s therapy but we didn’t like our therapist... I don’t know, it feels like something needs to happen and I don’t know what.TL;DR: My gf’s anxiety and depression send her into spiraling panic at the slightest provocation, and I don’t see an end in sight, but I can’t possibly break up with her for it without making it 1000x worse.204 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
mnltmh,1.0kPosted by6 months agoArchivedComments are lockedMy (24F) boyfriend (26M) has a long time female friend who's clearly into him and I don't know what I should do.
              
            [new]This is gonna sound like typical insecure girlfriend but I promise its not like that.My boyfriend and I have been together for over 6 months and he's really great. He has a friend that he's had for years who is a girl. Normally, I'm not the type to be all like "you're not allowed to hang out with a single girl alone". But I'm considering telling my boyfriend that he's not allowed to hang out with this girl alone. This girl is obviously so into him and she def wants me to know she's coming for him. She keeps saying stuff like "You don't know him like I do yet", "We used to go to that place together all the time long before you guys started dating", "Oh my god josh remember when we went on a hike just the two of us, that was the best day". She also had cute pet names for him but I didn't like that so as soon as I heard it I told my boyfriend I didn't like it and he made her stop.I asked her straight up if she's into him and her response pissed me off so much. She was like " I know its intimidating how close he and I are but don't worry you're the girlfriend I'm just a friend right?" with a smug smile on her face. I got so mad but I couldn't talk to my boyfriend about it.I want to tell him to cut her out of his life so bad but I don't know if I can do that. My boyfriend's dad passed away two years ago with a heart condition. He told me that his dad was his bestfriend growing up so it hit him really hard. He was the only family my boyfriend had. Apparently, this girl really helped him get through it. She apparently was there for him throughout the whole thing. That's why he says she's like a sister to him. That's why I don't know what to do. I already asked him to set some boundaries like she can't text late at night or come over to his place unannounced all the time and no interrupting our alone time.My boyfriend doesn't realize that she's into him and I kinda don't blame him on that one because all of her flirts are subtle enough that he doesn't realize but enough to get me riled up. I know my boyfriend isn't into her at all and he's completely friend zoned her but its still so frustrating. I hate to admit it but she's so good at getting under my skin and I don't know what to do. I really need some advice. Thanks Reddit.EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the advice. I've decided that I will tell my boyfriend everything she's done so far and see how he handles it. Tbh I was hoping I'd avoid telling my boyfriend about it but she left me no choice. In the meantime, I don't know how I'll bring it up to my boyfriend but I'll figure it out.TLDR- My boyfriend's long time female friend is clearly into him and she's letting me know in a subtle passive aggressive way. I need advice on how best to handle this.54 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
kqdlo8,990Posted by9 months agoArchivedUPDATE: I (29/F) am not sure where to pick up with my crush/coworker (34/M) after a weird incident at work?
              
            UpdatesSorry I didn’t reply to many comments on the original post, but I did read them all and I appreciated the advice! The situation basically ended up working itself out, but I figured you might like an update.I bumped into Laurence later the same day that I made the post, and just told him that I’d missed seeing him around. He said that he’d been kind of off his usual schedule since the incident and kept meaning to stop by my office, and he didn’t seem weird about it at all. We had a really good conversation, and it came up that neither of us had plans for New Year’s Eve. So he ended up coming over to my place on NYE, and we spent most of the weekend together. I guess it’s probably too soon to say that we’re “a couple” or anything, but it’s going well so far!Tl;dr: I was worried about nothing, Laurence and I are hanging out outside of work now.37 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
kxwn58,974Posted by9 months agoArchivedRecently found out my (28F) husband’s (29M) sister-in-law (29F) is his ex-fiancée.
              
            RelationshipsMy husband and I have been married since July. He was estranged from his dad/half-siblings long before we started dating so I only met them a few months ago. In October, his grandmother broke her hip, so we went to stay with her to help with her care. It got out that we were staying with her and his dad’s family popped in a few times to try and talk to my husband. He got really cold whenever they were around.Eventually, his older half-brother’s wife showed up too and insisted on staying over to “help”. She’s spent every second trying to get my husband’s attention. At first, I thought she was doing it to try and get him to talk to his dad’s side until his grandmother made a comment about how she was a desperate harlot. I asked her about it and she told me about how she used to be engaged to my husband but broke up with him for his half-brother when my husband got disinherited.He was very upfront when we first started dating that he had previously been engaged when he was 22 but refused to explain why they broke up. He just kept insisting their engagement was a mistake.I feel very uncomfortable now around her and I’m not sure what to do. We can’t leave because his grandmother needs the help and I really like her so I wouldn’t want to leave her on her own anyway. I did speak to him and he confirmed his grandmother’s story but thinks I should just ignore her.The thing is… I can’t. All of the sly comments she’s been making since she got here suddenly make a lot more sense. So, what do I do?TL;DR – My husband and I are living with his grandmother after she broke her hip. His SIL has also decided to stay here too to “help” but has spent all of her time trying to get my husband’s attention. I assumed she was trying to get him to reconcile with his family, but his grandmother told me she was his ex-fiancée. My husband wants me to just ignore her but I don’t think I can.167 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted

            RelationshipsTLDR: My boyfriend didn't tell me about one of my friends hitting on him. He turned her down but i'm still worried about the fact that he didn't tell me.A friend of mine tried to hookup with my boyfriend. He turned her down, but I'm sussed out by the fact that he didnt tell me. I only found out from my boyfriend's friend who was there when it happened. He thought that my boyfriend already told me about it, since it was her who hit on him and he turned her down and there was no reason to hide it.I confronted my boyfriend about it later and he said he didn't want to ruin our friendship and that he told her if she doesn't stop being weird he'll tell me. He says he wanted to give her a shot at saving the friendship.I already decided that I'm done being friends with her because I don't want friends that would do something like that. Besides I've always thought she had a thing for him anyway. She thinks that just because they met first that means she's entitled to him or something. I don't need that kind of bs in my life so if he had told me I would have cut her off immediately which is what I did when I found out.The problem for me right now is that its weird that he didn't tell me about it. I understand that it must have been an awkward spot for him but you'd think he'd want to tell me immediately to avoid a misunderstanding. Besides its weird that he cares more about potentially saving my friendship with her than he does making sure he doesnt come off as a cheater.My friends think he hid it from me because he was interested but I don't think he's that kind of guy. Granted we've only been dating for 4 months, and I still don't know him that well so anything is possible.What do you guys think? is it a red flag that he didn't tell me?92 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
ljjzwg,932Posted by8 months agoArchivedHow do I [28F] address this awkward text from my friend [32F]?
              
            [new]I have this coworker I've hung out with a handful of times outside of work. We've all been working from home so she has invited me on a few hikes, including one last weekend. Then this weekend, she asked me if I wanted to have a movie night with her.I declined. I usually am one to jump on social invitations and it's rare for me to say no to anything. I'm the friend that you could call at 1am and say "hey, we're about to go do something crazy" and I'd totally be down. But I really just didn't feel up to anything this weekend. I've felt super burnt out lately. I've worked long weeks and our line of work is emotionally taxing. On top of that I do dance and acrobatics classes 4 times a week, so I just don't have a lot of downtime. I was really looking forward to this 3 day weekend to decompress.  Plus I just got the covid vaccine and it's made me tired and headachy. My Valentine's weekend plans were basically to take a hot bath, wear sweats, and watch a lot of Netflix. And I was stoked about that.She accepted my refusal, but texted me a couple times today about work stuff, and called me at one point. I saw it but didn't answer because I was on a Facebook call with my sister. Then she texted right after calling, asking me if I could look something up in our work system because she was out meeting with a client and needed the info. That seemed important so I sent her the info. Then I went back to doing what I was doing. Not really a big deal.But then later she sent me more messages, which I didn't see right away. When I did open them, the first couple were just venting about work, but the next ones were odd. She said, "I'm going to get you to agree to a movie night someday, I swear I'm an awesome friend." Followed by, "I know you are super guarded and don't like most people but I could use a friend now."I haven't responded. I feel awkward because I didn't see them until late at night and several hours after she had sent them, so it seems like I was intentionally ignoring her. I wasn't, I just am notoriously bad at texting. Most of my friends know this and will use facebook to message/call me since I'm in front of my computer way more often than I check my phone. But also, I just wanted one weekend to disconnect and I feel like she has suddenly been kind of aggressive about contacting me when we really aren't that close and don't have a history of talking very frequently at all. Maybe she is going through something? But I wouldn't expect me to be her go-to person for support.I feel guilty for leaving her hanging and I figure I will answer her tomorrow. But I don't know what to say. I have no idea why she described me as "super guarded" and "don't like most people." She hardly knows me and that's not me at all. Sure, at work I try to stay professional and I don't interact with my coworkers as freely as I do my other friends, but I am a pretty easygoing person and back when we were working in the office, my office was the main place where people stopped by for snacks (I kept a bucket of chocolate for anyone who needed it) and to chat. So I really don't feel like I give off "don't like people" vibes.And it felt kind of patronizing, like she was implying that I don't have friends and am in need of her friendship. But I'm not interested in a friendship where someone is trying to "save" or "fix" me. I have had those friendships in the past and they suck. Now I have friends that like me for who I am, which is way better. I'm not interested in being anyone's project.I'm kind of upset about it and not sure how to address it.tldr: coworker/casual friend sent me some awkward texts that I don't know how to respond to.158 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
hl4bsj,933Posted by1 year agoArchivedMy good friend thinks I 'indulge' my boyfriend's OCD and is angry at me.
              
            [new]My lovely lad has OCD, when things are alright (whatever that means) you'd barely notice apart from him being really into organising and taking a tad bit longer showers. But when stressed it can be nasty - washing hands/doing dishes till there's blood; furiously cleaning instead sleeping; asking about the quality of aformentioned cleaning processes; trying to cook and cleaning in the middle of it etc.He goes to therapy, takes meds and before corona he got a service doggo so there hasn't big any 'bigger' hurdle for at least a year. Even quarantine went fine as we managed to come up with a makeshift routine (which I'm super excited about as it was one of the biggest changes in his lifestyle and even non-OCD folks struggled).We don't live together but when beginning a reconstruction of my flat I decided to do it as much OCD-friendly as possible. We have a lighting system that offers many 'levels' of brighteness, can be alterned to warm or cold. Bathroom is cozy af (if it makes sense, he once told me he didn't want to spend so much time in bathroom because it looked like a bathroom and, therefore, wasn't designed for spending decades in it but then he found himself doing exactly that and when he finally came out he felt horrible because he knew it wasn't normal). I purchased soap/shower gels with more natural ones so it'd not irritate his skin. Also included easy-to-clean-up surfaces and organisers.So far he managed to cook without scrutinizing everything for stains etc. for 2 weeks he stayed at mine. (that makes me happy!!)Onto the problem, my friend Aga who knows about my bf's OCD was one of friends I invited to my 'homewarming' bash. She was the only one who later insisted on having a few words with me regarding my new interior. Her main 'concern' was my flat being too much OCD-friendly. Personally I don't think there's nothing like this as he still has his thoughts and leads a normal, social life which keeps him on his toes. Also I had talk with his therapist and she told me it was worth trying and could be helpful if he was feeling 'supported' in my environment. I shared those thoughts with Aga but she replied with a theory when I should keep him alerted so he would get used to the mess etc. Which I cannot imagine doing, truly, as it would negatively influence our relationship.She refuses to visit my flat as it reminds her of my 'weakness'My family and those who I shared this convo with think I should keep my distance from Aga. But I don't know, she is one my close friends, we have never fought like that and it makes me anxious. I also start to worry if I didn't fuk it up, tho I know I can relate on therapist advice but it pops in my head now and again. So I guess I needed to rant on internet just to get this frustration off my chest.TL;DR I decided to adjust my flat so it'd be more comfortable for my bf who has OCD (after talking with his therapist). One of my close friends told me I was, in fact, supporting his illness and should put some kind of 'shock-treatment'. I don't know how to feel about this.196 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
kzuu0c,921Posted by9 months agoArchivedI [20F] found out that my best friend and only family member from high school [24F] faked her pregnancies... and literally everything. Six years of family was taken from me in one night. What is the process of getting through this, and possibly helping her mental health?
              
            Personal issuesI feel like I need to get this off my chest but I also kind of need advice for handling it. I really love her and I wouldn't want to leave her. If there's a way I can help her, she really deserves it. She never struck me as the type of person to do something like this or even have mental problems that would bring her to do something like this. Now it's really really messing with me and I'll need help getting through it. Even seeing things about pregnancy or best friends triggers the hell out of me... I can't even go to work and trust people or talk to anyone who we saw at school or look at memes.... I have live with no friends or no one to talk to but now there's no trust. If this counts as a catfish, then I got catfished in real life.She's literally the only family I've had besides for my boyfriend.. We met through a big mix of friends who were at the breakfast and lunch table. I'm a few years younger than her though she was in high school with me for 3 years because she would miss a lot of school and get held back due to her own family problems. Back then 3 years was a long long time, just because I was going through so much, constantly getting kicked out of my moms or dealing with her drunk boyfriend and moved in and out of the foster home because of physical abuse and things like that. She was there through everything. She was my role model, my hero like a mom to me, literally like a god. She would always bring food to school help with my medical problems and give very genuine consider advice. Never judge me for anything no matter how big of a nerd I was. She's literally my big sister. Even after she graduated and moved away, she still supports me online 6 years since we first met. She became my sister, but as lot of times she was actually like my mom and I called her mom and it felt so special and genuine and she would hold me just like you imagine a mom would....The thing was, back in high school about a year after we met, she started talking more and more about a best friend. (I never met this best friend but of course through genuine daily conversation, I just didn't have reason to question his existence. ) He eventually became so important she was talking about dating him and she has a lot of pictures of them, and he and I would talk online in a meme group with her and other people at school. Cool enough. I never went anywhere and this is a really big city with many schools, and she was popular with so many people, so I really didn't question anything as long as she was happy and safe. Eventually that conversation gradually turned into them being in love. I was happy for them but a shit ton of stuff was happening for me and I was going through a lot with my mom's boyfriend. Her support still came in and both of them would send me money and things, so he became like family to me too. She helped me through my first sexual experiences, a pregnancy scare, my mom's boyfriend's abuse, me losing my little brother, everything. He was also by my side. When my boyfriend hit me and blackmailed me and I got suicidal, she was EVERYTHING, she'd come over at 3 in the morning if I needed it.Her senior year came along. She was definitely going to be graduating that year and she also had some plans for college. I was a junior and I was kind of sad but I was already coming to terms with the senior thing and I knew she would still have my back. I knew her boyfriend would have my back too, especially when she revealed that he proposed to her and they were engaged. This was my first positive exposure to marriage with science for all my fantasies, so I can't explain how excited I was for them. January rolled around and before Christmas break ended, she stopped by to bring me some presents, and told me something that made me super super super happy-- she was almost a month pregnant! Everyone at school eventually knew about this within the first few months and she was so proud about it, of course I have no reason to doubt it. She would tell me all about her pregnancy and all this cool stuff about her life, both of us ended up making some new friends, and whenever her boyfriend was working a lot shall I would have movie nights and things like that. As her belly grew, we would go baby shopping like sisters and eventually I forced her to let me buy her some baby clothes as a present using one of my compensation checks. Same with food, eventually she caved in. She was now out of contact with her family and starting a new one and she was getting her life completely on and all she had to do was graduate, I was very very proud of her. She had all these amazing ultrasounds and it was all so beautiful, she gained a little weight but carried it very well. She caved in and eventually let our mutual friend give her massages and feed her and everything.Graduation came. She was six months along. She got me my support kitty, who I still have and live to death and even named after an inside joke. For whatever reason, she ended up not attending graduation. No big deal even though it was a lot of money and time spent planning for me to get myself and a few other friends there. I knew she'd graduated and I just assumed she wasn't feeling well. But not only did she disappear from graduation, she basically fell off the face of the Earth physically. I never saw her anywhere around or her to literally anything about her from anyone else, even though she never change her City on Facebook which she's very active on and even listed online jobs. Her only existence was on my screen and she would answer maybe a few times a week, sometimes every day, sometimes not at all. Though she always tells me that she loves me and she is very very supportive and I always have what I need. Eventually in the Summer she did have her baby and nobody even knew about it until she posted online, which I understand because she's had a lot of problems with her family and did have problems with a few people at school. She can have stopped posting on Facebook for a while, posting maybe once a month and stopped using her other social media. She's only had maybe five pictures of her baby, even in private messaging.About a year-and-a-half later, the fall after I graduated, life really wasn't going well for me. The only thing I had to look forward to was her revealing that she was pregnant again! She just found out that she was almost 3 months and everything was going very well for her. Needless to say, no post on Facebook, the birth of this baby was the same exact same as last time. Since this one was a girl in fact, she would be named after me! The middle name would be the nickname that she gave me and I practically graduated my role as her baby girl  and let it go to a second child who I knew would have an amazing parent.They started coming in regular contact with me almost everyday since their kids were one and two and she was a stay-at-home mom. Constant support, constant good advice and comfort, 3 a.m. phone calls whenever I need it, food whenever I need it even though it's sparingly, her giving me a ride to work when I need it. Now that I look back on it, should have two babies sleeping in the car with blankets over the seats, and of course I would listen like a small bean and I wouldn't have any reason to doubt her or make her parenting difficult.All that being said, am I allowed to see the babies when awake? No. None of our friends are. There's always some kind of excuse despite her being a stay-at-home mom. Do you know why? Tuesday evening, I was on Facebook. I commented asking for another picture and talking about how cute they were and everything. I noticed all her boyfriends old comments, which would be him answering other people's questions on her behalf, we're all deleted. Because his account didn't exist. Deleted account Maybe? Now that I think about it, probably suspended because it's fake with no way to verify it. I was asking people have to get in contact with them and they had literally no way to contact. I want as far to message someone who worked in the same place he was talking about working at, and they had no idea who it was. Nobody who works there at the idea who he was and so did nobody at the school he went to. Just amazing.The pictures also had comments from her cousin, who is extremely blunt because she is special needs and obviously doesn't know about this whole sham. Comments were saying things like "There's the cutie dolly! She finally came! Etc" normal for her, and then one stood out --- "did you see those baby's that are like the baby alive they eat and make sounds but there for adults and I know your just the avid collector so are we expecting one of those next month??? :)" .... Yeah, that didn't sound right to me, at all.I looked through more and finally noticed what once felt a little off. They have the same positions each time or have pictures that hide their hands/etc, all pictures of them sleeping, which adds up to more suspicion. I went back to the post with the cousin's comment, and it was deleted, but not before someone else from school could comment asking wtf.I went ahead and messaged her grandma, who had made a Facebook a while back ago, and was the only family she mentioned in a positive light. Turns out, she's living with her grandma, lost her job (because of her boss committing a felony and assault), has no money for school except for the college classes she did, has gotten in trouble for harassment and sexual misconduct, just living a shitty life in an efficiency with nobody except me and two friends she keeps in touch with, and being a mom to her baby dolls. I asked about boyfriend and grandma wouldn't say much but she did relay that there was a guy by the same name she used to have a lot issues with who she currently stalks and hacks..... His current girlfriend told me that he's told her about him being sexually harassed by and lied about. But girlfriend is also a huge drama queen, by the impression I used to get from her.I have never felt so low myself, let alone knowing my only family member who helped through EVERYTHING imaginable is now and has always been lower than anyone I know...Everything was taken from me last night. My family and the person I trusted most, the only person I trusted in my entire life. I don't even know what's real and what's not and I keep looking back at everything that wasn't and there's no cutoff to it.... She is obviously sick but I don't know what to do for myself or for her.Tl;dr: she was my best friend and the only one I could ever trust, going through sex and abuse and grief. Her boyfriend and her became like family in my darkest hour, and Tuesday it all had been ripped from me. Her babies and her entire life are fake as fuck, she's went out of her way to deceive me and everyone, and her boyfriend was probably her catfishing me (based on a boy she may have harassed and now stalks to the extreme). After all she's done for me to keep me physically safe and taken care of as well as emotionally supported, I am now deeply concerned and she deserves any help I can give her. I don't know how to help. I don't know how to move on for myself. Even seeing things about pregnancy or best friends triggers the hell out of me... I can't even go to work or talk to anyone who we saw at school or look at memes....54 commentssharesavehidereport94% Upvoted
mdmfet,936Posted by7 months agoArchivedComments are lockedMy Best Friend Is In Love With My Boyfriend
              
            Personal issuesI don’t know how to use Reddit. My boyfriend taught me so everything I know is from him and he recommended I get into the community so here I am.I (m22) live with my boyfriend (m22) and am friends with this guy (also m22 lol). I’ve been friends with him for around three years (when I started college) I met him and we clicked instantly. I introduced him to my boyfriend who wasn’t my boyfriend at the time but was a close friend of mine from high school.Friend (let’s call him Harry. not his name but yeah) so Harry had this boyfriend since I met him but they broke up a while ago like in December or January I think. I’m not really sure. Harry has always been the flirty type. That’s his personality. He doesn’t flirt with me but he’s flirted with my bf before and I have told him to stop a handful of times.It all came to a head a few days/a week or two  ago. My bf told me that Harry had come over and admitted his love for him. I was shocked but deep down not surprised. I’ve seen the way he looks at him and have gotten jealous before I’m just not one to talk about that’s kind of stuff. Also I trust my bf and plan on being with him for the future and stuff. (Bf rejected him really quickly btw. Hi if you’re reading this love haha)I call my friend and get really upset and it turns into a yelling match where he’s telling me He can’t control his feelings. I feel kind of bad for him. A few days later and here I am now. I feel like shit. I don’t have many friends cause I’m extremely introverted and have already been dealing with depression and stuff and just recently started seeing a therapist by my bfs recommendations (he Sees one).I miss Harry. He was my best friend. An I hate not having any close friends other than my bf since I don’t want to lay everything on him.I’m asking what to do in this situation. Should I reach out to Harry and try to reconcile or at least meet up with him to have a talk with the three of us together? I feel like we could reach a mutual understanding. My bf is iffy about it but he wants to do what I want. But I’m not sure what I want.TLDR: my best friend admitted his love to my bf. I got in a fight with the friend and now miss him since I don’t have many people to talk to. Should I reconcile with him?53 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
nw4gtj,929Posted by4 months ago[24F] How to stop thinking about my boyfriend [25M] with another girl
              
            Personal issuesMy boyfriend went away for a weekend with two of his female friends from college. I saw a picture where he had a hand on one of their legs. Nothing sinister but made me feel a bit strange and I told him that even though I trust him completely not to cheat it made me feel a bit jealous.He said he was glad I told him and that that's just what their friendship group is like (tactile) and everything is completely platonic. I asked him about other things like whether they would lay in each other's lap and he said that one of the girls had fallen asleep in his lap and I asked if he'd touched her hair and he said yes.I freaked out somewhat (not shouting just upset/ panicked) and he was very apologetic and said he understood why it was wrong even though he didn't realise at the time and has no feelings for her etc. That's fine and I believe him but I still can't stop thinking about it and I would really like to.Another silly thing is a memory I have from when we were first dating where we went for a walk in the countryside and I laid my head in his lap in a field and now I feel like that memory is tainted.TLDR: my boyfriend crossed boundaries with female friend and now we've discussed it I still can't stop thinking about it.309 commentssharesavehidereport95% Upvoted
j307yo,900Posted by1 year agoArchivedBoyfriend [31M] thinks he's a good photographer but he's not really
              
            RelationshipsHey everyoneI'd really appreciate any advice or perspective on an issue that's been bothering me a lot . In the grand scheme of things it's not a big deal compared to other issues on r/relationships, but nonetheless any opinions are welcome.My sweet bf of 5 years unfortunately thinks he's good at photography when he's not really.  I know photography is a subjective thing - some people think lomo photography looks great, some want their photos VSCO'd to death, some want something a little more true to form.  But there are some photos that people see and kinda go 'that's a bad photo', and unfortunately that's how his photos are.There's a few reasons for this:- He's very concrete about the 'numbers' and 'equipment' in photography.- He seems to legitimately think 'bad' photos look good.  A few of our friends have recently gotten married and they've all had really innocuous modern style wedding photos but he's been wildly critical of all of them for really concrete reasons.  For example a friend's reception photos had cleared been 'warmed up' slightly post production because she was in a venue with fairly harsh office style fluro lights, so the photos were made slightly warmer to make everything look a bit cozier, but my bf was like 'these colours are inaccurate and not true to life'.  Or another photo where the photographer had opened the aperture to focus on the couple and the background 'crowd' of guests were blurry, he pointed out that the background crowd wasn't in focus?  When I said I think that's the point my bf thought I was insane.  Or there was another 'arty' style black and white photo where the wedding couple had their foreheads pressed together, and the photographer had shot it so the couple were a black silhouette against a light archway, my bf was critical of the photographer for not using a fill flash to light up the couple.  He doesn't seem to understand artistic choices in photography at all.He's SUPER SENSITIVE about his photography.  He has other hobbies which he's extremely good at, for example building PCs and woodworking.  He also engages in these hobbies way more (like every week) than photography, which literally, he's engaged in like once in our relationship together in 5 years. But if you ask him what his hobbies are, he says photography first, and if you mention the other stuff, he says he just 'dabbles' in them.  You can also give him opinions and suggestions on the PCs and carpentry and he doesn't get upset at all, but any differing opinions on photography make him very upset.  It's like his whole sense of personal worth is tied in with being a photographer and I don't get why.Because it's become really obvious that we don't agree on photography, we've both taken an 'agree to disagree' stance on this.  He initially gave a ton of unsolicited advice every time I took a photo, he's backed off now when we decided we have different opinions on the matter.  But the issue is, for all of our shared memory photos, like for our holidays, or when we got our first dog, because he thinks he's very good at taking photos and its very important to him, he takes over the process.  We've got all these really fairly ugly photos of our important times together, and it makes me really sad.  I feel really embarassed when I look at them.  For one of our holidays together he asked why I didn't share any of the photos on social media, and I didn't have the heart to tell him why.  I showed  a few of my friends privately and they all agreed that the photos were really bad.On one hand, I don't think it's right for me to say 'your photos are bad' because like I said, it's a subjective thing, and we'd just end up arguing over what counts as a 'bad' photo because we don't agree on this.  He also legitimately doesn't seem to see why everyone else sees so it's a losing battle.  But on the other hand it's really hard for me to keep pretending he's a good photographer when he's not.Any advice or thoughts appreciated.Tldr - bf thinks he's a great photographer, seems to have different photographic artistic tastes to the rest of the world and it's driving me a little nuts.186 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
hjy4me,907Posted by1 year agoArchivedI’ve [25F] been seeing him [29M] since fall and still isn’t ready for a relationship despite introducing me to his parents
              
            DatingSorry for the long wall of text but my heart aches and I just feel so confused ..Last fall, I was with someone for a year who basically kept me a secret from his family due to religious reasons. This relationship taught me that family plays a big role for me in relationships, because I don’t have a stable one of my own. He dumps me, because he basically admits he’d never show me to his family.During this same time, this friend of mine who was getting really close to has troubles with his girlfriend — when I told him that my boyfriend at the time and I broke up, I notice that he breaks up with his girlfriend the weekend after .. and ironically, we hooked up.What I thought was going to be a double rebound that would last only a short while, I realized I fell for him... we ended up spending Christmas, New Years, and both of our birthdays together. He introduces me to his family and in this time period, he takes me out on 2 trips with his family under the same roof. We act exclusive to each other and have amazing sex almost every other day and our parents are both familiar with us.Before the corona virus quarantine, we basically acted as if we were together — but one day over webcam, we were arguing (and I forgot over what) and he gets upset when I asked him to tell me what’s on his mind — he gets mad at says that I don’t have that privilege because I’m not his girl. Obviously this hurts me and after that day, we stop talking. He tells me he’s not ready for a relationship — and this totally breaks me because I made it clear that I didn’t want anything with him if he didn’t want anything — so we agreed to date — but he changes his mind and says that he’s not ready and can’t give it to that.Fast forward to June and he asks to hang out — I come in with hesitation because I want to respect what he wants about how he doesn’t want a relationship. I decide to entertain it — we hang out for like a week and we acted like fwb (which I was totally ok with) until he drops the bomb that his feelings for me never changed & that he would want to work it out with me and that it was never that he didn’t want to be with me — but he didn’t feel like that he was the best version of himself and felt that if he got with me, it would set us up for failure because he felt he wasn’t ready. This leaves me with really complicated feelings — I really liked him before and I felt so scared when he confessed his feelings again (when I should be happy?? Right?!) I tell him that I’m not so sure about my feelings for him because he burned me last time ... but the distance between us from before closes and we became closer.We went on hiking trips, to each other houses, and basically acted like lovers again.. and honestly, today I had a breakdown in front of him how this just feels like a rollercoaster and that I always have to keep in the back of my mind that this would end again, that this isn’t forever — we’re both crying at this point and he tells me that he still feels like he isn’t ready and that maybe we might miss each other again ...I don’t get his head and I don’t get mine — why do I keep coming back? Why does he keep coming back? Why do I feel like I’m not enough? I don’t understand how someone can introduce me to their family and be that committed to me and not make me theirs ... ughThere are a lot more details but I’m exhausted and tired. Sorry for such a pathetic postTD;LR I’m a loser girl for falling for someone who isn’t ready for a relationship and we’ve been seeing each other exclusively since fall — but we get along so well and we have so much fun and both of our parents like us so I just don’t get it. But I have a feeling I don’t need a get it :(214 commentssharesavehidereport95% Upvoted
ls29y1,904Posted by8 months agoArchivedComments are lockedI (33/M) sometimes think my girlfriend (27/f) is ugly and I want to stop scrutinizying her apperance
              
            Personal issuesMy title is a bit click-baity so I hope you hear me out before you react.I also know that this post is going to make me sound bad but before I begin, I have never and I will never say anything about this to anybody. I know this is a personal problem I have that I want to work on if someone can point me in the right direction.First and foremost, I know I am shallow. VERY shallow. I see this as a character flaw of mine and if I could remove my shallowness surgically, I would.My working theory why I am shallow is because girls didn't really go for me growing up, everybody got girlfriends around me but I didn't so as I got older I got fixated by improving the things I could improve, so I started exercising all the time and researched fashion and spent a lot of money on clothes. I also think that because I didn't get girlfriends before I sort of hyped it up that I needed to have the best girlfriend to justify all the years of wanting.But as I got older, my looks and physique improved, and I could get dates and girls, and I got to the point that it was no longer an issue. I know this kind of post makes me sound like an asshole but again, realize that this is all internal, so whatever my potential dates experience is completetly detached from this part of me that I am showing to you.I have tried to date a lot of girls based purely on apperance, and it never worked out. As I was doing it, it never felt worth it. I started to see that you need to have more in common than just physical attractiveness.Then I found the girl I am now in a relationship with, we have been together a 1,5 years and the relationship is effortless. We have lots in common, she is super in to me and expresses so daily. She says I'm the love of her life. We have never really had a fight. She is open minded and wants to try new things, something that I really like.For the most part I think my girlfriend is beautiful. As a shallow man I wouldn't have gone on more dates in the beginning if her looks throw me off. I have done so countless times before. So what is happening now I see more of as a disese than I am clearly seeing reality.But okay, I sometimes thinks my girlfriend is ugly. And it's in fleeting moments, then she looks like herself again. I think my brain is sick from all people we can see on social media as well, it compares her to these photohopped airbrushed surgically enchanced individuals and I don't know why.Like it is only causing me misery and I don't understand why my brain has to "invent" this right now when I haven't felt like this until now.I know my post is vauge so I will try to make a concrete question, like I know this is the girl I want to stay with. I have had enough experience with others to know that it's someone like her I need in my life and not some instagram girl, but i just wish my brain would stop causing me these moments of upset.Is there anybody out there that was shallow but then found some method to work on it? Like the ultimate goal for me would be to be satisfied with this relationship. If I could press a button that guranteed that this relationship worked for life, I would press it without hesitation.TLDR: How can I be less shallow and enjoy relationship with 27/F more?44 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
kbbm3l,895Posted by10 months agoArchived[Update] - I[40M], a happily married man, have become obsessed with a woman after having my world turned upside down.
              
            UpdatesOriginalWell, I took everything you all said to heart, and truly appreciate your thoughts and concerns. I did a lot of self-reflection. I'm not naive, and I realize my mind is injured, and that this obsession I felt/feel is a result of a broken brain. And I concluded that, with the realization of what is happening, I can shift aside those feelings and overcome them on my own.I did attend another group chat, and the woman I initially obsessed over was there not. Honestly, I was actually a bit heartbroken not to see her. There was a new woman on the call and she acknowledged me in a few ways that lit sparks in me. And I am thinking about her a lot now. I wouldn't call it an obsession, but she is definitely in my thoughts. Like, a lot more than I think is healthy or natural. So yeah, I think I need to seek out help. And that's a whole other thing. I am not the kind of person who can easily admit injury or error. And I don't like to share my feelings (aside from behind a computer screen). So, I'm going to work on this even though its really daunting. Once again, thank you all for you care and kindness.TLDR: I started to become obsessed with another woman. I concede my mind is broken. I need to seek professional help.70 commentssharesavehidereport94% Upvoted
j7dqzd,887Posted by1 year agoArchivedHow do I stop hitting?
              
            Personal issuesI (20f) was hanging out with my so (24m) today and we were playing around and I was hitting his arm and he looked at me with a weird expression and asked me if I realized everytime I hit him. I asked him what he meant and he told me whenever I’m doing anything with him I hit him on his arm or somewhere and he wasn’t mad but was genuinely curious if I just express myself through hitting people. I felt absolutely awful because when I thought about it I do hit him a lot it’s not like I think about it, it’s a natural reaction for me. I grew up in a abusive home where we didn’t really show our emotions unless it’s was anger or violence. I’m on the most healthy relationship I’ve ever been in and I apologized for doing it and he said that it was okay but maybe I should talk about it in therapy ( I’ve been in therapy for a while now for my childhood) I definitely will but also wanted to see if anyone else had this problem? Is there anything else I could be to help this?Tdlr: so asked about my constant hitting and I’m looking for ways to stop it.93 commentssharesavehidereport95% Upvoted
n95hkj,896Posted by5 months ago2My (29F) husband (30M) wants to get back together but he has a girlfriend (25F).
              
            BreakupsWe were together since we were 18 but we separated 3 years ago. The separation was my fault because I pushed him away when he was trying to be there for me after a miscarriage. We didn’t have any direct contact in the first 6 months because I felt extremely guilty being around him because I had an accident that could’ve been avoided which I blamed for the miscarriage, and it was easier for me not to face him. Despite that, he has been more generous to me than he needed to be.The dilemma I have is that my ex/husband wants to try again and is adamant he doesn’t want a divorce, however, he has/had a girlfriend. He claims she’s just a FWB and their relationship has always been primarily about sex, but she reached out to me several times and has told me he is the love of her life. I know from speaking to my SIL that he has broken up with her several time and that she has been trying to force her way into their family.When I spoke to the girl, she seemed to really love him. She made it seem like the only reason they hadn’t moved in together or taken the next step was because my husband felt guilty because he is still legally married. She said I was like a black cloud hanging over their otherwise perfect relationship. She also has a daughter who she said is attached to my husband and sees him as her father figure. Also, she said I was making her a struggling single mother again by “stealing” my husband and that his family were manipulating him into taking me back because they didn’t like her.I still love him, but I don’t want to be the “other woman”. It’s strange because we’re legally married still, but I still feel like a homewrecker, even though they’re currently broken up. My family and friends all think I should mend things with him, but I just don’t want to hurt someone the way I hurt him again.I could really use some advice on what to do.TL;DR – My husband and I separated because I pushed him away after having a miscarriage. It’s been 3 years and he wants to try again but he has/had a new girlfriend who claims he’s the love of her life.350 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
lbqsli,879Posted by8 months agoArchivedmy(37F) husband's(38M) behaviour and his clingy parents are wreaking marriage.
              
            RelationshipsLong story, sorry.We have been married for 12y have a G10. My husband is a very loving father and husband and i have fun with him always.He has weird parents. The kinds that cling to their kids, the kind that creates huge drama if the son works a few mins late or lifts his daughter into air. In short they are very possessive.To give a few examples They visit us for a month every now and then , and plant themselves firmly on either side of their son in everything. There is absoultely no time for personal communication, and my husband fails to grasp this. According to him they are here for a month and I have to be the supporting wife and stay away from them. we initially had knocks on door early in the morning,beacuse they have missed their son already. There is no respect for privacy.If at all we ever have a laugh or go out together, FIL finds weird reasons to start a fight and grab attention. He keeps quoting his poor health and threatens death.MIL is another story, shes a control freak who likes putting me down always. She has to immediately take over the kitchen whereever she is. And oh yes she invariably doesnt cook for me, ever. She enables the FIL, sometimes even encourages to throw tantrums.Husband and I have been in a relationship for 15 years and married for 12 and consider each other best friends. so where is the problem, its how he behaves when they are around him. He never draws a line. They can humiliate me in front of him carry on with crazy tantrum but he doesnt tell them they are wrong. I am usually ignored in his presence, considered invisible. The conversation stops if I am in the vicinity, and in general all the shit in the world is dumped on me. His absence is another story, they turn into interrogating nazis where everything from my personal stuff to the furniture placement is questioned throughly, and turned against me when he is home. They lie and twist everything. I have had conversation with husband regarding this behaviour and has only encountered silence or denial.We are visiting them for lockdown, and right the day before we were supposed to leave( after staying for a month) FIL becomes extremely moody and says he is having a panic attack when the son is leaving. I ( like an idiot) suggest we stay another week because we have flexibility. And within an hour there was this huge drama convincining ME to stay back. They are very good at turning tables and work together as a team.What bothers me is that the son buys this shit. Its always the same set of answers. " No they arent like that", "I love you and you are my priority" " they are just old" worst " YOU ARE IMAGINING". These answers set a sort of frenzy in me. I usually dont understand how someone can be so steadfast. I am going insane because I donot understand what is goig on in his head. I am getting panic attacks ( had a major episode last week, which was brushed aside), because I am at a loss as how everything is my fault. I dont understand why WE are fighting and why I am being made to be the person I am not.please internet people tell me where I am wrong, I have no one to turn to.TL;DR Husband's very clingy parents are wrecking marriage and I am doubting my sanity.EDIT: Thank you kind strangers. It helps to know that I am not the crazy one.Update : In the last 36 hrs I have finally reached a point where I couldn't take it anymore. I had a very strong conversation with my husband and told him clearly that I cannot be married to his parents anymore. Surprisingly, he agreed with me( I didn't see it coming). I am going zero contact with them.Thank you very much kind strangers for helping me with this.138 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
nq57lw,895Posted by4 months agoMe [24F] conflicted about seeing friends after gaining 55lbs in a year
              
            Personal issuesYeah, the title pretty much says it all.The last time people saw me in March 2020 I was 5”4 and 143lbs and now I’m almost 200lbs. I wouldn’t call it a quarantine gain because I was already on my way to gaining weight due to my binge eating and depressive episodes and birth control but quarantine definitely took away the little exercise I used to have during the day from walking.I’ve been trying to hide from people and deleted my social media and avoided reaching out to friends, thinking that I’ll recover my friendships once I “glowed up.” The past few months, I had a couple friends reach out and I definitely felt upset turning them down with various reasons as to why I can’t video call or have a socially distanced meet ups.Currently I feel extremely lonely and with the vaccination and the weather, I really want to see some of my friends before I lose them. I was actually surprised that 2 of my friends reached out to meet after I’ve ignored them for a year.Anyway, I just feel like they will be so surprised and judge me for letting myself go and I’m not sure if I’ll be able to be “myself” because I’m so self conscious now. Also one time when I gained weight and saw one of my old fiends, she audibly gasped WOW.I guess my question is when you guys meet someone you haven’t seen in a year and they look much bigger, what do you think? Would it change your perspective of them? Would you lose respect for them etc?tl;dr: anxious to see friends after gaining lots of weight, how do you deal with it?283 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
l6j61b,884Posted by9 months agoArchived6 YEAR UPDATE: I [23 M] am feeling incredibly lonely, inadequate, and isolated.
              
            UpdatesOriginal Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dyprb/i_23m_am_feeling_incredibly_lonely_inadequate_and/For awhile I have been thinking of updating this post. I recently logged into this account and saw someone had PMed me about my old post, so I thought I would give an update so that maybe in the future if someone is ever in my situation they feel less alone. I guess I would say that I don't exactly feel inadequate anymore, although loneliness and isolation have been a battle. It is weird to read back on that post. I do feel that at times it was self indulgent, and that I was maybe feeling too sorry for myself. But at the same time, it brings back a lot of painful memories as well.I am 29, almost 30 years old now. I'm an ER Nurse. I never ended up getting a girlfriend, FWB, or into any sort of exclusive/committed relationship over the past 6 years. My relationship with my friends has improved quite a bit, but they are all in committed relationships and I am the single one which means that slowly but surely our interests and goals have started to diverge. They are focused on settling down and I am still stuck in the phase of trying (and failing miserably) to find someone.Looking back on everything that has happened, it is pretty hard for me to think of how things could have potentially been different. Hard for me to see how I could have acted differently to make my dating situation better. I don't think my physical standards were ever too high. Physically I find most women attractive, so long as they aren't morbidly obese and seeing as how I always kept myself in an athletic shape I didn't feel like I was being unreasonable about that. I wasn't ever picky about a girls race, age, height etc. I would never rate myself a 10/10, but even with me being an Indian guy I felt I was at least decently attractive. I'm not stupid. I have read the threads on here about Indian men, and seen firsthand how it has effected my dating life but I don't want to place the blame on anything really other than fate.During my 20s I was pretty broke, maybe a few hundred bucks left over at the end of each month. After I became an EMT I went on to work nightshifts running 911s on the ambulance and in a busy inner city ER. I would then get off work and then head straight to class to knock out my nursing school pre-reqs and sleep afterwards. During this period I really had no time to seriously date someone and was completely focused on just improving my life situation. I occasionally went out to bars and a couple times ended up having one night stands but that was it. When I would go on serious dates the hurdles of working 2 night shift jobs while going to class would rear their heads and most people could not relate not only to my inexperience, but to my life situation at the time.I ended up getting into to a nursing program in an extremely rural, conservative area of America. I'm a brown guy that has been mistaken as Muslim my entire life and without getting too much into things I never felt comfortable in that part of the country being seen in public with a white girl and so I just avoided dating altogether while I was there. After I got my degree I left that area for a more diverse metropolitan center where I felt more comfortable walking around in public.Afterwards I became an ER Nurse and here we are today. I've still never been in a relationship or exclusive situation with anyone. I've never even had regular sex. During these past years I have tried to improve myself throughout these past years as best I could. I bulked up, gained muscle, figured out how to tame my hair etc. Back then I was already really fit, but I have maintained good fitness since then. I've dressed better, even though back then I was dressing well. Got my own place, my own car. Reconnected with a lot of old friends. Read up on dating advice, attachment theory etc. Learned not to take rejection so personally. But ultimately it has just felt like running into a wall over and over again. When you're on the receiving end of so much rejection it becomes hard not to internalize it. It becomes hard not to feel sorry for yourself, or to feel sad. It becomes hard not to feel inadequate.A lot of the advice I received in my old post and from other resources focused on picking up hobbies and building an interesting life. And I have felt that I have done that but haven't found any results, and to be honest I don't know if people even truly care about that stuff. I dirt bike, I rock climb. I do yoga and work out. I've got an old Japanese import that I've tuned and modified. I have interests in music, movies, anime, video games etc. I feel like I am pretty outgoing in general and have no problem making friends at work.I'm in a place where I feel like on paper I have a lot to offer someone but deep down I feel like I have lost all enthusiasm for dating completely. I just can't do it anymore. Every single time I have fallen for someone it has completely blown up in my face and I've watched them go off with someone else and felt even worse afterwards. Completely miserable. I end up pining after the people that reject me and clinging on long afterwards hoping for a second or third chance while they completely forget about me. I tried online dating, but the reality of online dating just made things worse. I don't think I can bring myself to get attached to someone I met on Tinder or wherever when they can just swipe right on someone and hook up with them the same night whereas for me even getting a single date or match that I am interested in is a deep struggle.I have read that at some point during your 20s your brain stops developing, and you just who you are. It's just hard for me to even relate what the experience of being single and lonely for my entire life is like to someone. Girls quickly lose interest when they find out that I've never had a girlfriend. I can get first and even second or third dates but at this point I don't think I'm capable of feeling any sort of spark or emotional connection with anyone anymore and so I rarely pursue them because I don't want to lie to someone else about how I'm feeling.The pandemic obviously made things worse. I had met someone I was interested in over Tinder when the lockdowns started but they never felt comfortable meeting in person due to my job. And so I lost them to another person and am stuck in this same cycle of pining over someone who has rejected and forgotten about me. Feeling like I lost the only person that had ever displayed interest over me. Over the past few months I have had many dreams where I die. And right before I die it is always the same thing, this deep sad feeling of despair over the fact that I have never experienced what a relationship or requited love feels like.I wouldn't say my life has been totally depressing, or is even depressing right now. Compared to where I was when I was 23, I feel like maybe things have even gotten better. I have a roof over my head and a job. I have the time and some money to pursue my interests. I don't always feel this depressed or sad, but the sadness and loneliness does add up quite a bit over time. I guess what I would say to someone else in my situation is just to try and keep building the life you like and putting yourself out there but even for me it is hard to sometimes take that advice.tl;dr: Things got better for me in some ways, and stayed the same in other ways.123 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
kq032l,876Posted by9 months agoArchivedComments are lockedMy [23 F] Bf [27 M] Finally Agreed to Confront His Ex [28 F]. She Dropped A Bomb Shell?
              
            RelationshipsMy bf told me his on/off ex of 7 years started contacting him this past week. She was leaving very sexually explicit messages. He wouldn't block her he just said she would eventually go away.At one point he told me to pose with his dog on my Instagram so she'd get the point that I was with him.Yesterday he finally agreed to confront her with me there. He called her 5 times but she didn't pick up so he decided to leave a text with the following, "Leave us the f*ck alone. I don't like you!"His ex responded back with, "You're saying this 'cause she's right there, LOL. I miss you so much. This reminds me of last time and we see what happened to her. Please let me know when she leaves."We are in a long distance relationship. I'm afraid since he's known her for almost 10 years she knows him better than I do. I tried asking my bf what she meant by "see what happened last time." He said she doesn't know what she is talking about.When he was in the bathroom today I saw she texted his phone. He hadn't blocked her. He only blocked her on Instagram.I feel he may. be still into her. I wanna confront him about seeing her number pop up on his phone.Tldr; Bf's ex was texting him nonstop for 1 week. Bf finally agreed to confront her. She doesn't believe me anything he said because he said it in my presence. She's still calling.264 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
jmr3kv,876Posted by11 months agoArchived2My [25F] Parents [51F, 54M] are very disappointed in who I am now seeing [23F]
              
            Non-RomanticHello. I am trying to write this post in a non-bias way, which may not be the final product of this post. I don't want to paint anybody in a bad light or make people seem like they're being grossly unfair, but I'm just in a situation I've never dealt with.Background: I am my parent's only child. I have been the apple of their eye. They pushed me hard to excel and I am very grateful for many things they did for me. I had a relatively easy childhood, to say the least. And my parents and I were always very close to each other. I played the piano, the violin, and the flute and my parents attended all my recitals. I was on the basketball and volleyball team and they never missed a game. I would perform in the marching band and branched out to color guard and they never missed a show. My parents were supportive of everything I did and graciously helped pay for my college (50/50) where I now work as a private educator and absolutely love it.While in high school, I dated a boy my age that we'll call Tim. Tim was amazing. And we were together from age 15 to 23. We broke up due to simply growing up and becoming different people. It was amicable and we are still on good terms and have overlapping social circles. I see him at parties and get togethers and we always catch up like nothing ever changed. In a way, I'll always love him, but it's been well over a year since I ever pined for him or thought about him daily. He's studying to become the lawyer he always wanted to be. In the past month he's started dating another girl from his school and she and I get along just fine at get togethers, too. My parents obviously really liked Tim. He was motivated and well-trimmed. Came from a similar background as us. His parents were sporty and fun. Our parents still hang out, though they always wish that we would get back together. (Which makes me feel bad for Tim's new girlfriend.) I always iterate Tim was great but we just weren't meant to be together. We were young when we were together and were the hopeless teens that always imagined our wedding days and children's nurseries together. But as we grew older, we confronted reality. Tim will always be one of my best friend's, but he will never be my intimate lover like that again.In the past year, I've become very close to one of my dearest best friends who I met in college. She was a pharmacy major while I was education. We always had boyfriend's at the time but were always so close to each other. We confide everything in each other. In the past year, obviously it's been rough, and we leaned on each other for support. We could vent our professional and personal frustrations or just get together to relax, watch a movie, and tune the whole world out. In that time, however, we became closer and more romantically involved. It started with brief kisses to test the waters. She had been with girl's in the past, but I never had. My bisexuality was never lost on me and Tim was kind enough to explore that with me. I've had experience with girls but never dated one and that was a fear I expressed to "Edan". Edan was understand, naturally, and we took things slow and steady. But now I feel we have a solid foundation together and genuinely call each other the other's girlfriend. I'm glad I stepped out of my comfort zone because I've found true comfort and a warm love from her. Though, the relationship is still new, I feel optimistic about being with her. When my parents found out my new partner was a girl, however, I could see the disappointment oozing out of them. They saw a future of grandchildren and a "normal" family, whereas now their only child is in a gay relationship and more on the side of never having children. (I love my students, I just don't want any for myself.)Contact from my parents has significantly dropped. Usually I have to check in first to evoke a conversation from them. Sometimes I call and no one answers. If I come to visit on the weekend, we stumble into awkward silences and the hesitation to ask how Edan is becomes very apparent. I know it's a shock and they grew up in a different time. They may not understand but I'm at a loss on how to "explain" without having to justify my choices. They still tell me they love me and never turn me away if I pop over. I just wish things didn't have to be so weird. It's like walking on eggshells. I was hoping maybe they just needed to warm up to the idea, but we've been together for five months now and it's still just as weird. Edan has met them, too, and commented that I had quiet parents when that's not the case at all. My parents are a hoot and have the loudest most distinguishable laugh in a room.Has anyone dealt with this or have advice? I'm going to post this and do my work to take my mind off things. I want to return to this post with a clear conscious that is open to any and all feedback. Thank you for taking the time to read this.**Tl;Dr: Parents are disappointed I am now seeing a woman instead of a man. Feeling awkward with my parents and I despise it. How do I normalize my new relationship? How do I make my parents understand I didn't "change"?**116 commentssharesavehidereport95% Upvoted
nnlyha,929Posted by5 months agoComments are lockedI (32F) snooped on my husband's (33M) phone and found out he is bi
              
            [new]we have been married for 5 years. My husband has different message tones for all his closest friends. Over the last weeks he has been texting a female friend, I think she got a text from her through the day and it was way above normal that I noticed it. He has also been very protective of his phone. He always used to leave it unlocked, would lend it to me if I wanted to do a quick search but he has beenwith his phone. He never locks his phone and he always takes it with him wherever he goes.he had told me that at the start of their friendship - 12 years ago- he had feelings for her but it was fleeting and they have a really strong friendship. I was feeling jealous and betrayed. I have been cheated on before and I still am a bit insecure about this.  Two days ago, He had left his phone unlocked. I opened his messenger and he last message was - I am good at hiding it. I should have just left the phone at the table and minded my own business but that text confirmed all my fears and I couldn't stop myself from opening it to read.I regret it. He wanted to come out but was scared. He was scared of my reaction. He was scared that I would not find him attractive anymore and that we would have to get a divorce. He thought it was not worth coming out. I came to my senses and I kept his phone back on the table.My head is spinning a little. What do I do know? should I tell him that I know and that it is okay? I feel terrible for hiding things from him. I want to apologize to him for snooping on his phone. I also feel a bit sad  that he was more comfortable trusting her than trusting me which is not very mature on my part. would it be better If I tell him? I want to do what would make him happy but I can't just ask him that.Tl;DR : I thought my husband was cheating. He was not, he is bi and wanted to stay in the closet but now I know and I am freaking out how to deal with this.104 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted

            Non-RomanticI never was official with Ray, 39m, but we were talking/being FWB for a while. I considered it dating.I’m 25f.I think he felt like it was always more and going to be more, but ended up going back to an ex and I moved on with my life. We dated three years ago.I recently found a finsta (fake Insta) he made of various posts going back three years about me. In the posts, he talks about losing “the love of his life” and through details I’ve confirmed it’s me.He writes about how he’s upset I moved on, how he’s miserable, asking people close to me about me, interactions with me, and seeing me from a distance. He also writes about how to get me back.It’s not threatening but it is weird and creepy.He wrote about how it seems like I’ve “talked to him less and less” over the past year and why, which is sprinkled in with stuff about how he hates me since I won’t talk to him.He’s married now with a kid, and his public Instagram is followed by 10k. He seems to be a very well liked person.What do I do? Do I report this account to his wife or just keep monitoring it? Do I tell him I found it?TL;DR Friend/ex FWB Ray, 39m, made a fake Instagram where he vents about me. It seems like he hasn’t moved on from our relationship three years ago and bemoans how I have. What do I do?128 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
mgp3y3,866Posted by7 months agoArchived3In love all over again after relationship therapy, but how do we keep the spark alive?
              
            RelationshipsMy husband (40M) and I (37F) have been married for 15+ years, and have two toddlers. When we met we were really into eachother, we couldn’t keep our hands to ourselves... and then life happened, we renovated our home, got busy jobs, had two children, gained weight,... and with all that we stayed friends, but sex or intimacy was no longer happening...Last year during lockdown we were at our lowest, we weren’t communicating, lost eachother. I felt unhappy, lonely and unloved, broke down and told him we were either getting a divorce or getting relationship therapy.We decided to try therapy, not really believing in it, but felt like we owed it to our children to try everything before we got divorced. We yelled, cried, were at our lowest, but step by step realised love was still there. We started talking again (about things other than the kids), had date nights (at home thanks to covid) and then... chemistry came back... and wow!Things are hotter than ever, we tease eachother, we send dirty messages, talk about out likes and dislikes and try new things together, I feel loved and safe, but also feel desired... I’m 37 and having the best sex of my life, which does wonders for my mood and all other aspects of our relationship... We are a team again, not just mom and dad, but partners. We fell in love again. Which we never thought possible...TL;DR Therapy saved my marriage and made me happier than I’ve been in a very long time! We learned not to take eachother for granted and to make time for love. But I’m afraid we will lose eachother again down the road... how do you keep the spark alive?38 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted

            RelationshipsMy husband and I were having a hard time together, as lockdown ended and he's busy all day and doesn't spend time with us. We don't fight, but we definitely miss the spark we had in early stage of our relationship. We've been married for 10 years and dated for 5 We're having difficulties with sharing our problem with each other, like we did in early stage of our relationship.Recently I talked to ny husband about this, and he suggested that We should make fake account on FB and we should pretend we're total strangers.At first it was really really weird. We were acting as stranger which talking to each other. I jokingly asked him about his wife and he proceed to write a long rant on me. It was fun, we learned a lot about our mistakes.It brought spark back in our life. But he's different guy when he acts like 'Mike' (His fake acc) I like mike more that my husband.Real life and the life we both share on FB is very different It's really exciting, we dare each other. Lot of sexting We act like a teenager while we're on FB.But sometimes I feel like I'm cheating in him. It's a weird feeling really hard to explain. Like inside our house we're husband and wife, and outside we're Mike and June.We're trying this for 2 month and I'm in love with this Mike guy my husband has been playing. Is it ok to feel this way..Should we continue doing this ?? And why can we do to improve this lifestyle???Tl;dr Husband I were having kind of hard time communicating with eachother he came with and idea to overcome that105 commentssharesavehidereport93% Upvoted
j1flg1,860Posted by1 year agoArchivedWife (33) and employee(28) are making me feel uncomfortable
              
            RelationshipsWe are both females and have been out and gay for a very long time. Kara is the breadwinner and for now I stay home with the kids doing school stuff.So my wife Kara (33) and I have been together 10 years and have 3 kids. Before all this: Our relationship is beyond perfect. I definitely found my best half, only small disagreements here and there, but otherwise we are pretty chill and laid back. I mean parenting is rough at times, but we make a good team. Anyway..She’s worked with a woman, Mia (28) for about 5 years.. first at a different company than brought her over to her new company. My wife is a boss and can hire and do whatever she wants at her company and she knew Mia was a good employee. My wife is the total opposite of me; outgoing, talkative, really nice to everyone. People often mistake her kindness as flirting and she’s completely oblivious that people take it like that. She’s just a friendly person.Mia’s personal life is a mess. Lost her kid to her ex, never has stable housing, cheated on her ex husband with a family member of his (edit added).. But according to my wife she’s a good person etc and knows she made mistakes, fine whatever I get it people mess up.. I’ve never met her all these years because my wife doesn’t hang out with her like that, just work/text friends. Even so we helped her find stable housing because she seemed important to my wife and I wanted to support her friendships.Well in August I’m on my wife’s phone, yep snooping because we have never cared in the past about our phones and privacy, but something felt off. I wasn’t sure if I was being paranoid due to my past with dating cheaters, but I was curious. Most convos were on Snapchat and a lot of saved pix. Found some that were partially nude and suggestive. Obviously I lost my shit and brought it up right away. She apologized and said it wasn’t like that and how she felt bad for Mia and how Mia had bad self esteem so she was being nice and those pix were sent to a lot of people not just her. I said as her boss and as a married woman she shouldn’t be saving pictures of a basically naked women she knew. I have zero problems with porn, as long as the person isn’t someone we know!She deleted Snapchat on her own. It was also weird how Kara had used her own Amazon account to buy stuff and have it sent to Mia’s apartment. Some of the stuff was questionable like beyond giving to a friend, but Karas excuse was that Mia didn’t have her own account... but all the sudden that weekend she got her own. I had no knowledge she was buying her stuff and “being paid back” .. she mentioned it 1 time when she first moved into her place she was getting her 1 thing, but that’s it. Otherwise the other 10 things I had no knowledge of.Mia has said in the past my wife is amazing and how jealous she is of her life with me. So now in hindsight that screams home-wrecker?!I asked her to limit contact and I honestly wanted a break in our relationship because it all seemed so sketchy. But we have built this amazing life together, so obviously it’s hard to put that on pause.Shortly after that my wife was off work for a few weeks and worked from home. We reconnected and worked on things and I really thought we were moving passed it all. She was really working hard at redeeming herself. She still had to talk to Mia at work and I noticed she limited texts, but never actually checked because I honestly wanted to believe her.So recently her phone wasn’t attached to her and I looked at her texts. Yea she texts Mia and nope not all work related. Kara sends her pictures of our family doing stuff or random things throughout the day and Mia does the same.. a lot seemed deleted and watered down. Only a couple comments seemed off and made me uncomfortable.This time I haven’t said anything yet, but she can probably tell somethings off because I’m pretty short when we talk. I’m so tired of talking about it.. she knows where I stand with this woman. So what else do I have to say? I don’t want to be controlling and tell her who she can and can’t talk to.. Im one to always face problems head on and work to fix it, not ignore it, but maybe I should?Tl;dr- wife has gotten inappropriate pix from an employee and has worked to fix it but it seems to be continuing to some extent. I don’t even know what to say anymore because I’m sick of talking about her.112 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted

lgt270,858Posted by8 months agoArchivedMy boyfriend(26M) is emotionally cheating on me (26F)
              
            RelationshipsMy boyfriend were laying in bed when I heard his phone go off. He got a notification on his phone and it read “I got you tomorrow 😘”. I asked him out about it and he flatly showed me the message. Prior to her message he had messaged this girl and asked her why she hasn’t posted her daily photo that day. However, when I checked her profile she had indeed posted just didn’t post her “daily” selfie. From what I could tell in her previous stories she loved a full body selfie. Another message was to a Instagram Model and he asked her to marry him. He had messaged and flirted with other girls through out our relationship. When I confronted him and asked him why he had to seek validation from others he said he didn’t know and it was just a simple comment. I communicated that I was upset with him and  it was breach of trust and I don’t think he respected me if he sought out to flirt with other girls. To which he replies that he loved me. He said he didn’t think about it in my shoes and that it was a bad habit of his that he wanted to get rid of. I want to forgive him because I truly love him but we’ve only together for a few months and I’m torn. Should I end it now and save myself misery and heartbreak in the long run or should I forgive him and wait for him to stop messaging other girls even though I’ll always be on my toes.TL;DR: Boyfriend has been seeking validation from other girls on Instagram. I’m trying to understand why he would do that. I’m really second guessing our relationship and was wondering if I should break up with him or work out this bad habit.241 commentssharesavehidereport95% Upvoted
ldajij,857Posted by8 months agoArchived22My boyfriend [27M] refuses to talk about marriage or the future in general with me [27F].
              
            RelationshipsMy boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 years (since we were both 19 in college), and we moved in together about 2.5 years ago. Years ago, we'd occasionally discuss getting married someday and having kids, and it seemed like we both wanted the same things in that regard. Recently, since we've been living together, every time I try to ask him anything about the future, even like planning how to get to our friend's wedding a month from now, he refuses to answer anything and just says he doesn't want to talk about it right now. I asked him a couple weeks ago if he wanted to get married and he just asked me the same question back, and when I said yes, he just went silent for a while and then said he didn't want to talk about it right now. I feel like he's constantly shoving me away and I'm feeling scared that now that he's faced with the actual "threat" of commitment, his real feelings are showing, and that he was just lying to me before. I don't know what to do at this point and could use some advice.TL;DR Boyfriend won't talk about the future anymore and I'm frustrated.EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the advice! I'm going to put my foot down tomorrow morning (before he's had time to get bogged down by anything from the day), and get either some clear answers, or get an agreed-to specific time to discuss marriage and our future goals as a couple.EDIT #2: I appreciate y’all trying to stand up for me, but I’d like if you’d stop calling him an asshole, etc. He’s a genuinely lovely guy and we get along great as a team and have for the majority of our relationship. It’s just this area where there’s a big problem that I’m trying to get sorted out. Thanks!198 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
ie2dun,848Posted by1 year agoArchivedI (35M) made a new friend at work (40M) and I figured out the woman I’m seeing (40F) is his ex-wife. Should I mention this to him and how?
              
            Non-RomanticRight now we are only casually seeing each other because she is a divorced mom and a full time career woman in the time of corona. We met a few months ago. The other day he mentioned his ex on the phone and when he said her full name I got it right away. Him and I have worked in the same company for many years, didn’t know each other before because he typically works out of a different office, and now talk after work a few times a week since quarantine and game together a lot. I'm worried because before when she mentioned her ex, it seemed fine and peaceful, and when he brought it up he seemed angry about the ordeal.tldr - How can I tell my new buddy I'm seeing his ex?93 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted

lqal2s,831Posted by8 months agoArchived4UPDATE: Breaking up with my [38M] unstable fiancee [38F]
              
            UpdatesOriginal post here:https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lcuhl7/advice_on_breaking_up_with_my_38m_unstable/I want to thank everyone who chimed in with advice and feedback, which helped validate my beliefs that my partner was abusive and situation was untenable.  In the midst of the relationship, I doubted everything, but I feel much clearer now.I did it.  I broke up with her, and flew back to my home country.  I thought I would wait a bit longer before making the move, but some unexpected money came in that allowed me to book my flights, and once I made up my mind, I knew I had to do it quickly.  It was terrible, there was no way for me to leave in the middle of the night because I had too  much stuff to pack and I needed it all for work - I had to go through a confrontation and endure 3.5 hours of her trying desperately to change my mimd.But I was determined to get out of there.  I had made up my mind that I would call the police if she tried to stop me from getting in that taxi, and/or an ambulance if she threatened suicide.  She did neither - I think she could sense that I was not fucking around this time, unlike previous breakups where I lacked the resolve to follow through, and let myself be manipulated and persuaded into staying.Anyway.  It's over now, for the first few days I was worried sick about her well-being, but our friends are taking care of her and may even let her live with them while she figures out her next move.  I'm honouring my plan to pay her expenses for two months and I'll cut contact completely once that's done.I moved to my brother's city where I will spend the spring and summer, and he is expecting a baby soon so I will get to be an uncle and help out around the house.  I'm grateful to be around family and to have something to look forward to.  I feel like I've taken my life back.  Still, I'm sad, I really did love her dearly.Thanks everyone for giving me frank but helpful advice, it made a huge difference, I am ready now to start my healing and get on with my life.TLDR; went through with the breakup.30 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
jtiytu,821Posted by11 months agoArchivedMy (27F) best friend (27F) abandoned me for my ex (27M) and his friends when we broke up. Now that we’re back together, she wants to reconnect.
              
            [new]"Cindy” and I were best friends since we were young (our parents are also close friends). I started dating “Luke” during uni, naturally, I introduced him to Cindy, and we used to invite her along whenever we hung out with his friends. Two years after graduating, Luke and I broke up.For the first two weeks, Cindy pretended to be there for me but slowly she started pulling away. Eventually, she just stopped responding to me. She blocked me from her social media but claimed she had deactivated her accounts. A mutual friend of mine and Luke’s eventually told me she was still hanging around with Luke and his friends. I was devastated because I felt like she had abandoned me for people she saw as an “upgrade”. It also hurt when my mum would mention all of the cool places/events Cindy was going to and asking me why I never wanted to go with her (she made it seem like I stopped talking to her to our parents).Luke and I reconnected last September and have been dating again since January. We decided to take things slow, so we barely told anyone that we were back together. Last week, Luke was video chatting with some of his friends, Cindy was in the chat. I walked past while he was talking to them and everyone asked if we were back together. We told the truth since it would be weird for me to be staying with him otherwise.Anyway, a few minutes after the chat Cindy sent me a message saying it was so nice to see me after so long and we should catch up. She also refollowed me on social media again.I don’t want to make things awkward, but I was really hurt when she abandoned me. It feels like I’m only good enough to be her friend when I’m dating Luke and that sucks.How do I interact with her without making things awkward for everyone else?TL;DR – My best friend ditched me for my ex and his friends after we broke up. Now that my ex and I are dating again she wants to be friends again.198 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
mj9zys,823Posted by6 months agoArchivedI don’t want to have sex with my boyfriend anymore
              
            [new]Me(24f) and him(29m) have been living together for nearly a year, and sex has dropped from once a day at first to once a week but now about twice a month. At first I had been wanting to talk to him about our declining sexual frequency (he always refused to have sex with me because he was stressed). I am a high sexual need person. But he always evaded or always promised to change(but never did). Gradually, I stopped looking forward to having sex with him. I work it out on my own, but I basically say yes every time he asks for sex. But I didn't enjoy it anymore. I was on a mission when I had sex with him. I still wanted to have sex and still liked it, but the thought of having sex with him suddenly turned me off. I love him but sex is also an important part for me. I feel I am so pathetic sometimes.Anyone have similar experience or advice?tl;dr: after my boyfriend refusing have sex with me for a while, I lost my sex desire to him.257 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted

lwn44l,808Posted by7 months agoArchived223I (50s) may be acting too motherly towards my young neighbours (20s?) and worry I am crossing a social or personal boundary
              
            Non-RomanticI am in my 50s and have lived in my neighbourhood for nearly ten years with my husband but the house next door (and many in the area) are homes renovated into apartments for students so there are lots of young people around. I have seen and spoken to two young ladies new in the past year, often when I go outside at night to toke, they live next door. Sometimes they come out and chat with me in my backyard (over the fence) I don't know if we are "friends" but we are certainly friendlySometimes they lack things they need, and I will gift them an old beat up blender or toaster. It is nothing to me and they need things. In return they sometimes come to help me, like helping me hang up shelves when I need an extra pair of arms. My husband warned me not to be creepy by chatting with young people and I try to keep that in mind, but nothing seems untoward to me personally.I might have crossed a line when one afternoon when one of the girls asked if I could make a dentist appointment for her because she was afraid to call them. At first I chuckled a little but she insisted and seemed sad. So as bemused as I was, she handed me her information and I made an appointment for her. I did it on speakerphone and we chatted afterwards about how the offices really don't care if you sound awkward, just have your insurance information ready to read off of a paper and you will be okay. I told her this was a good and easy skill to learn (that's why I did speakerphone so she could hear both sides) because I remember being anxious about silly things in the past as well and she needed an appointment so I thought it wasn't too strangeWhen I told my husband later he suggests I may be crossing a personal boundary and he may be right. We are only neighbours and of very different ages, so not peers. And maybe I am acting like a mother, which could hold those girls back in the long run by preventing them the need to face some awkwardness themselves.On the other hand, it seems harmless to help neighbours when you are able.We only speak over a fence but sometimes drink tea across the fence and chat a bit. It is nice to have company and they seem sweet. So I worry I am being selfish in wanting the company and so am acting in an inappropriate way towards these students now.Can anyone advise on figuring out the best way to proceed? I'd like to be friendly neighbours, but would not like to be the weird old lady messing with the college kids.TL;dr: I might be getting too friendly with the young ladies (20s?)  who live next door and acting like a mother and therefore crossing boundaries156 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
i71awe,804Posted by1 year agoArchivedThe more my boyfriend (M25) wants sex, the less I’m (F23) attracted to him.
              
            RelationshipsI love my boyfriend of a year very much. He is a lovely person who brings joy to his surroundings and my life. I truly feel happy with him.I’m his first relationship and his first sexual partner. The problem is... his form of seducing me is literally telling me that he is horny and he wants to fuck. That’s it. It does not make me in the mood at all, it even makes me want it less.Sometimes when we are together, he just tells me he is horny and when I say that I’m not in the mood, he proceeds to ask me if he can masturbate. I truly don’t care if he does, but when he asks me about everything and proceeds to put porn and masturbate right in front of me, I feel... weird. I feel like I should be there to please him, but I just don’t want to. And I feel weird that he is asking me. And I feel like I’m not enough to overcome libido for one day. The thing is, very often after he masturbates with porn, he can’t even do anything later, so if I’m horny, tough luck! And god I can’t get into mood when his form of seducing is always asking!Before you ask, I do initiate and quite often. I already tried taking to him but he doesn’t get it and when I got frustrated yesterday, he started having panic attack and begged me to be happy. I want to be 100% happy, I just can’t when he does this.Reddit, please, help?TLDR; Boyfriend “initiates” sex by literally telling me that he is horny and nothing else. When that turns me off, he puts on porn right in front of me. I’m getting more and more frustrated.162 commentssharesavehidereport93% Upvoted
hpfdrg,801Posted by1 year agoArchivedMy ex (23F) wants me (24M) to ship her stuff back to her but refuses to pay for shipping. How do I handle this?
              
            BreakupsMy ex and I met during college, I’m from the area and she’s from out of state. When she graduated in May of 2019,  me/my parents offered to let her to store some of her things in my parent’s garage while she moved home so she didn’t have to pay for a storage unit - these items consisting of basic cook wear, bedding, shelves, and other random belongings. This January I finally decided to end things with her after what I believed to be an emotionally abusive relationship, and she’s been pressuring me to ship her stuff back across the US. Total shipping cost to do this is estimated to be around $500, based off weight. What she has here isn’t even worth $500. I offered to ship her any items of sentimental value and other particular items and donate the rest, but she is firm on wanting everything. I asked if she can pay for the shipping then or at least we split it, but she said no. Her reasons were because I have a job and she is unemployed, and because this is the cost of me breaking up with her. She also says these are her items and she has a right to them, which i agree with I just don’t believe the cost of shipping falls on me, since the only reason I’m even in this situation is because I offered to do her a favor to save her from paying for a storage unit. How do I handle this?Tl;dr: ex wants me to ship stuff across U.S, will be expensive, won’t pay, how do I handle this?214 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted

I have no idea how long he spent in prison for this original offense, but he’s been in and out of prison for different technicalities since my husband and I started dating in 2012.He was a big part of my husband’s life, and therefore mine. My husband didn’t know what he had been charged with when we were dating, and told me upfront he didn’t want to ask.Now I know the reason he was arrested, I feel sick.

nd7i09,801Posted by5 months agoMy [32M] wife [30F] earns less, wants more
              
            RelationshipsMy [32M] wife [30F] earns less, wants moreMy wife of nearly eight years, who I love dearly, has expressed her wish that we purchase a home in order to start a family within a couple of years. We have some savings, enough for a down payment on a house, but it is not an extravagant sum, by any means. We’ve been arguing about money lately because she earns about 30% of my income, yet her “needs” continue to stack up —we have been paying her tuition as she’s studied, in cashwe recently spent several thousand dollars on a legitimate medical concern (hers, but it would be inappropriate to hold this against her, despite what it means for our finances)but she does see doctors for every scrape, bump, bruise, coloration, etc. that appears anywhere on her bodyshe wants a larger apartment with more features between now and when we buy. my office is in the living room; i consider this simply a fact of life, it makes her irrationally upset to see my books, papers, computers, a couple of guitars, etc.we recently spent $500 on kitchen gadgets she “had to have”all of her makeup is name brand (Sephora), she gets her hair done professionally, monthlywe have a thoroughbred Boston Terrier, because she “had to have” a French Bulldog and I didn’t want to shell out $2.5k for a pupshe wants a larger diamond for her engagement ringshe’s upset with me because we don’t see her favorite bands live often enoughher family live abroad and hope for more than annual visits; my family are domestic but ten hours away. flights aren’t typically free, neither are accommodations when visiting my familyToday she came to me and I was informed her dentist had advised her she needs braces or Invisalign or else her teeth will simply eventually fall out, on account of her overbite, which terrified her, and that the cost would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $5k after insurance.**I got upset because there things I’d like to do that I’m unable to specifically because this relationship always seems to have an inventory of expenses greater than our ability to pay, and because I’m the higher-earner, I have to be the one to decide what we can and cannot afford, and this tends to turn me into a villain when I am upset and frustrated at what appears to me as an insurmountable burden, despite that I purposefully keep my expenses low and have pushed back some plans, potentially indefinitely, precisely in order to solve for her apparent needs.I did try to explain that when my income was only slightly higher than hers, at my first job out of college, that I still had roommates and could not afford my own place; that the reason things were different now was because I took that understanding and channeled it into my work, to earn more precisely not to be so broke.My question is: what would you do here? We’re both frustrated to the point of ending things. I don’t see this as a real solution because all it’d mean for her is that she still wouldn’t be able to afford all of the things demanded of me by her, the difference being that instead of me being the person to tell her no it’d be her bank. I care about her well-being; I do love my wife; I simply don’t know how to express to her the limits of her/our finances in a way that causes her to take inventory, prioritize, and set reasonable goals on timelines that make sense and enable us both to get what we want out of life.tl;dr I feel that my wife has many luxury expectations despite a poverty-level income, for our area, including that I’ll simply pick up the tab as a higher-earner, and that this is killing our marriage** I am not convinced of this and I’m waiting for a second opinion elsewhere as to the extent of what is necessary for the maintenance of her dental health. I need a filling, which I’ve been waiting on until I travel abroad on one of our family visits to correct due to the high cost of the American dental system.369 commentssharesavehidereport94% Upvoted
j032q3,795Posted by1 year agoArchivedMy (F27) boyfriend (M29) thinks that because I work from home, I have time during the day to do chores around the house.
              
            [new]At first, I thought the permanent move to work from home made by my company was going to be great. There are certainly other perks to it, but it has made many aspects of my life awful.My boyfriend has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. He actively drinks every single day and can’t go one day without. He works for his father. He gets there at 4pm and he’s back home usually between 9:30pm - 11:00pm at the latest (so about 25-30 hours per week.) I work 50 hours a week and my job is extremely demanding and stresses me out beyond belief sometimes. The work piles on so much, so quickly, I skip breaks all the time (or clock out if I have to and keep working) and forget I’ve eaten half the time. Many times when I I log off from my main job, I move onto my personal computer - I freelance and have a few clients I do work for. I do all this and he still makes more money than me. Sometimes I have more time, sometimes I feel like I have no time to myself at all. When I have some more time, I clock off and workout, take a shower, and get to my freelancing. Lately it’s been no time at all.My boyfriend seems to think I’ve gotten a free ride. I can supposedly hang out at home all day and do whatever I want. Certainly I have time to do all these chores, right? And if I can’t do them while working, I could just get up earlier and get some things done. (I stay up all hours of the night working on my freelance work. I usually get 6-7 hours of sleep until I have to log back on to my full time job.)When I try to explain it to him, he acts like he understands, but it comes back up in conversation later (usually alcohol-fueled). He brings it up all the time. When sober, it’s passive aggressive.The past couple of days he’s had to get into work early in the morning and work throughout the whole day. Tomorrow will be the third and last day he has to do it, then it’s back to his normal schedule. So tonight he drank his booze and got angry with me that some things haven’t been done, that he worked a 12 hour day and that I should be able to pull away from work “for five minutes” to do these things. I was still working on my freelance work, but I went to the bedroom to get away from him. A couple minutes later he opens the door to tell me I act like I do so much but I’m just lazy and then proceeded to slam the door.I’m angry and frustrated - I’m wondering if maybe I’m just the a**hole. A lot of the time I’m usually able to do the dishes and get some laundry done but I feel like his expectancy of what I do around the house has shifted ever since I’ve been working from home. A lot of the time I miss going into the office and having it be a completely separate part of my life. Now it’s meshed with home and it’s a mess. I get the weekends off and he has Sundays and Mondays off and sometimes takes Wednesdays off and he spends the day drinking and and starts these arguments with me while I’m at the computer. He’ll see me check my phone a couple of times (responding to client emails or texting a friend back.) and he tells me he thinks all I do all day is “sit on my phone.”I’m not sure how to communicate with him that I’m trying my very best. I know I’m not perfect, but I work overtime constantly just to make an extra buck and I really do give work my all. I get to as much as I can on the weekends, depending on how much freelance work I have.What do I have to do? Physically show him the work that I do during the day? Should I just pull away from work and just do these things? I’ve tried expressing that all my work stresses me out and it turns into a competition - that he works harder than I do in a shorter amount of time and he still finds time to do certain things.TL;DR! - ever since working from home, my boyfriend expects more housework to be done because he thinks I have all the time in the world to do it. How can I communicate to or show him how much work I do in the day and how it stresses me out to try to do all this housework on top of my regular work?197 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
hwf9p2,787Posted by1 year agoArchived[Update]: Me [30 M] with my [30F] wife 6 years married, intimacy issues
              
            UpdatesOriginal thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7eyqx9/me_27m_with_my_wife_27f_married_for_4_years/So, figured I'd drop in and give everyone an update. The last two years have been challenging, and no things never really got better.Most of last year, I was in serious depression with the constant guilt and feeling of inadequacy. I've done everything I could to try and fix our relationship, communication, effort.. the whole 9 yards but the fact of the matter is, I've completely lost interest. Things would be okay for a week and then back to how they were.After a prolonged discussion (and me completely breaking down), at least we're on the same page that I cannot be expected to maintain that same level of effort with no effort from her. Again, it's my issue... I guess.I think I've made my peace with my r/Deadbedrooms life. Intimacy is important in a relationship and it has affected our relationship as friends too. But I just see her as another family member now which makes me sad because I really did adore her and tried my best.Didn't really think it'd come to this but I guess that's how life goes.PS: Divorce isn't really an option. She's too dependent on me.And for those asking why I posted this. I'm finally at peace with myself after a long period of depression driven by my situation. Getting closure has helped me and I felt like sharing my experience. Maybe it's not the best avenue for it.tl;dr Not every story has a happy ending.377 commentssharesavehidereport90% Upvoted

jlimwx,779Posted by1 year agoArchivedMy (23F) father has dumped the financial responsibilities of the household (including my 15 y/o sister) on me and went away.
              
            RelationshipsI'm a 23F from India. My parents are divorced since 10+ years and me and my younger sister have been living with my father and grandmother since.My mom has remarried and has a whole new family now although we still keep in touch and are close with her. It was decided at the time of separation that my father would be responsible for me and my sister.I just graduated recently in 2020 and got my first ever full-time job in July. As soon as that happened, my father quit his job as he has never liked working. He asked me to sustain the household (which includes me, my sister, my grandmother, and my father) with my income and every month I'm the one paying for whatever is required in a household. He has even declared that he has no money for my sister's school fees and has asked my mom (who can't pay the fee either) to pay so at the end even that expense is on me because I love my sister and won't let her future be ruined like this.I come from a very lower middle class background and my father's income was not that great to invest in savings. Everything was used up for the day-to-day livelihood. Even my college fees was funded by the money we got from a policy that my mom insisted on doing when I was born otherwise I probably would not have graduated. I did not take any pocket money from my father for the last 3 years either and sustained myself working part-time as a home tutor. It was enough to cover my travel and other personal expenses outside the house.He recently left home and went to look for property in the countryside. He wants to live a peaceful life in the countryside but we have no savings whatsoever to buy and shift our entire lives in a secluded place especially when my sister is just 15 and studying in school. I don't know what he wants and he guilt trips me to pay for everything by saying that he has sustained and helped me grow to this point all his life so can't I do the same for him. Even my grandmother emotionally holds me hostage by saying if I don't pay bills and for food, what will we eat?I just want to live my life independently and away from this household. All my life I've only dreamt of living on my own away from all the negativity and family trauma that I can't escape. I was hoping that with a job I'll be able to do that but things have turned so bitter. With all the money I'm spending on the household I have nothing left to save to get a place of my own. And now there's no one to look after my sister either. I'm in a very hellish state of mind. It feels like a prison.Any advice is appreciated!TLDR: I recently got my first job and my father quit his. I'm being held responsible to pay for the entire household as well as my younger sister's school fee. I want to live away from family independently but can't do that if this goes on.EDIT: thank you so much whoever commented. I'm still new on reddit and this was the first extremely personal post I made. I'm overwhelmed by the response. I rarely ever reach out to anyone regarding family related matters so this is huge for me.EDIT (2) : Once again, I'm overwhelmed beyond words that all of you took out the time to extend your help and kind words to me. Currently I'm working from home (due to covid19) and my office will be opening in January. The office is quite far from where I live now so that will be when I move out as I anyhow need to be closer to where I work. I will be discussing all of this with my sister and how to move forward now. Will keep you guys posted!122 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted

            Non-RomanticMy fiancé [M31] and I [F27] have been together for 7 years and could really use some advice about this situation with his uncle [M58].Background: We haven't had the easiest time with his family. His mother [F58] is one of those moms that truly wouldn't like anyone fiancé was dating and tried to run me off starting when we'd only been together a few months. She also wasn't a great mom to fiancé (stole about $2k from him, neglected him as a child to the point relatives called Child Protective Services, even ran off and disappeared for a couple of weeks) and his dad [M60] is a classic enabler who really doesn't want to rock the boat with his wife and will do anything he can to make sure she's happy. As a result of his mother's continued antics, he went no contact with his parents for a couple of years, then was guilted into being in contact again around the time we got engaged (3 years ago, this is important later) but it went so poorly that he's back to no contact with them.We were supposed to get married in 2020, but with COVID we postponed to 2021 and decided to downsize to a micro-wedding to try to be able to keep a date (and frankly, it's all the venue was comfortable planning for... and we had contracts we were trying to keep). Everyone on my side of the family was understanding and frankly relieved, whereas most people on his side of the family were... well... the opposite.Now, this uncle is claiming that my fiancé actually proposed to me 5 years ago and I said no and humiliated him... and that my fiancé posted about it on Facebook and then "deleted it." I have no idea what he's talking about and neither does my fiancé... and I'm pretty sure we would both remember a proposal that we were both supposedly part of? This uncle is telling every family member who will listen that I did this and humiliated my fiancé and I'm obviously a terrible person and that they should all band together to fight against our marriage. When my fiancé confronted him, and asked him what all this was about because it wasn't true, the uncle insisted it was and told my fiancé to stop lying to protect me and that he and his kids saw the post and know the truth.I went to school with his kids, so I asked them myself if they knew what he was talking about and where this might be coming from. They have no idea what their dad is talking about. Uncle has been spending a lot of time with my fiancé's parents lately and this truly reeks of something his mother would do.We really don't know how to navigate this from here. Fiancé has been trying to maintain relationships with the rest of his family (outside of his parents) and this is making him feel like he just needs to cut all ties. I feel devastated for him and feel like if I do anything it will make things worse. Do we try to correct this with an email to his family? Do we contact them one on one? Do we ignore it? Do we cut all ties like fiancé is leaning toward?TLDR: Uncle [M58] is spreading a rumor (that has no basis in reality) about my [F27] and my fiancé's [M31] relationship, as "evidence" that I'm a bad person and the family should not support our relationship. What do we do?87 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
nnye90,785Posted by5 months agoMy (33F) best friend (32F) told me that she and my husband (36M) had a semi-affair almost a year ago. She wants my forgiveness because she wants me back in her life.
              
            [new]We've been married 7 years now and it's was mostly ok. However, after 5-6 years of marriage a huge part of me wanted a divorce. I wasn't happy with who he'd become, I felt lonely. He was too caught up in work and the marriage felt stale. We had sex, but it was only because we're both HL and it didn't bring us closer or fix anything.I told my husband what was on my mind back then and it hurt him tremendously. He did start to make effort, but at that point, I mentally was checking out of the marriage. We would have separated if finances allowed it. So I told him give me time to think and we'll try to work on it.During that time, I had a small falling out with my best friend as well and we weren't chatting much either. My husband and she were always pretty close as well.He doesn't open up to his guy friends, but he said it's easier to do with women. He did ask me before if he could talk to my best friend about our issues and I told him I didn't care. Truthfully I did care, but I felt his needs outweighed mine.This led to them becoming very very close. They would meet up to 'chat' at dinner, or at pubs at least once a week. I was never suspicious until one night.He left home at 8 pm saying he was meeting Emily (my best friend) for dinner. He's normally back between 10 and 11pm, but this time he came home close to 2 am. I was livid.He said after dinner they drove to the waterfront to 'talk'. The waterfront area is a well-known area in my city where couples park up and fool around. We did it a couple of times there as well.He swore they just talked and nothing happened.I stupidly trusted them. This happened 2 more times before I eventually told him he was getting too close to her! And that made me very uncomfortable.Coincidently, she started dating another guy soon after, so they sort of stopped seeing each other.Their 'dating' period was late summer last year (2020), almost a year ago.However, last week she begged me to come over to talk. During this conversation, she told me how she and my husband admitted they had feelings for each other. They considered an affair or relationship but didn't want to disrespect me. She said they never kissed or had sex. But she did say they had phone sex once and exchanged nudes. She said she started dating a new guy right after this incident. She said I was right to suspect something back then.She said they were both feeling vulnerable and had no intentions for anything romantic to happen. She said for the first few 'dates' she felt no attraction to him.She said what changed was how gradually she saw how well he understood her and made her laugh and realized that no guy she dated was as emotionally deep as we my husband.I get that, he is a very good conversationalist and he and her always had a good friendship since I introduced them.While I was totally mad, I appreciated her frank honesty and understand that they were two people who I genuinely liked and part of me wouldn't even be too mad if they hooked up once they were happy.Now I called it a semi-affair because it ended before it really started. She said she only told me now because she and my husband swore they'd keep it a secret. But she said she felt it was my right to know.She begged me not to tell my husband that I knew, but I told her I could not promise her that.She said, he also wanted to tell me as well, and they deliberated long and hard about it, but decided for everyone's best interest, I shouldn't know.She said she missed my friendship so much and how I'm more important to her than any other person in her life.So.....this was a week ago. I've been playing it cool with my husband since, but it's eating me up inside. I have forgiven her.I just don't know what to do, tell him? Forgive him? Be understanding?Reddit, I really need your help. What would you do in my position.Also, please know the last 6 months have been the best in our marriage. He admitted that he was sort of having a midlife crisis and depression back then and zoned out from me. He's been a different person since, someone I truly love and can spend my life with.tldr;Discovered from my best friend that my husband and her had a semi-affair. I've forgiven her, but I haven't told him I know. I don't know if I should even tell him, or if I should forgive him.183 commentssharesavehidereport95% Upvoted
it2bwy,773Posted by1 year agoArchivedComments are lockedMy (32M) best friend (34M) helped a woman (24F) cheat on the father of her child (1F)
              
            Non-RomanticPretty much the title. My best friend of the last decade helped a girl cheat on the father of her 1 year old daughter and I'm having difficulty reconciling the person I knew with the person he's being. For the last decade I thought we were on the same page morally, ethically, etc and he knows how much I hate cheating and associated actions (my own family was torn apart by cheating when my parents divorced). And yet here we are. He helped this girl cheat and is refusing to take any responsibility for his actions. Makes excuses at every turn. Best part is he rents a room from me in my condo. While I don't want to be a complete asshole and kick him out, I don't necessarily want to be around him anymore. Honestly I have to have a buzz from alcohol before I can even tolerate his presence. I know it's probably overkill but that's how much I hate cheating and how much I can't stand the people that participate in cheating. I don't know if the friendship is able to be salvaged and I don't know if I want to salvage anything.Tl;dr: my best friend helped a woman cheat on the father of her child and I don't know how to feel except angryEDIT: Wow ok so my update post blew up and the comments ended up here. I tried to keep things somewhat vague as idk if my former roommate or the girl use reddit. But..... eh screw it. To answer some of the questions: yes he pursued this girl while she was still in the relationship, yes I was involved because he brought the situation into my home before she split from the child's father (this was after I had made it clear that my home was not to be used for their affair), and lastly.... this guy and I were basically brothers. We'd been friends for the last 10 years and roommates for the last 5. We were pretty entwined in each other's lives and the whole situation sucked by the end24 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted
mwyur8,764Posted by6 months ago2Future stepdaughter(13f), whom I just met, told me that I was the worst thing that ever happened to her, what do I do to fix this?
              
            Non-RomanticHello redditors,I (37M) proposed to my fiance (34F). She was adamant that I not develop a relationship with her children until we had a real plan for the future. Well that plan was solidified after I proposed and now I am getting to know my future step children (13f, 11M, and 9M). Now I should start by saying that I am infertile because of an accident that I got into while younger. Despite this, I always wanted to have kids by adoption or other means. I know this may seem weird coming from a man, but I really wanted to be a dad and I was so happy that this might finally happen. I know I can't replace their biological dad, but maybe be an adult they can ask for help and look up to.8 weeks ago I met her children for the first time when we took them out for ice cream. It was really awkward at first, but 9yo was really talkative and led the conversation. Overall I thought it went as well as it could. 9yo and 11yo have the same father, who is presumed deceased in what was a really sad story. I have been able to bond with them playing video games and they are really excited to move into my house in a couple of months because I have an entire game room with multiple computers and they will each get their own bedroom for once. I feel bad for "buying" their affection, but they seem okay with me and there is no drama about replacing their dad as they barely remember him. Furthermore, their paternal grandparents seem to be happy with me as well, which I did not expect.The 13yo is a completely different story. Her dad is a vagabond for lack of a better description. He occasionally comes into the city, maybe once every other month, and takes her out for a day and buys her things. For some reason, she absolutely idolizes this man despite him not paying child support and only seeing her once every other month. He even fails to show up on some visits with no explanation!!! I have made no mention of my thoughts about her dad to her or her mother because I feel it would be inappropriate of me to comment on this.This weekend the kids and fiance were visiting my house so that we could set up their rooms and get everything ready for when they move in. As a bachelor for most of my adult life, I have no idea what teenage girls are like and I was trying to ask her what I could do to make her more comfortable in my home and she completely blew up at me. She said that I was not her dad and to just leave her alone, because she wouldn't be here long and she would move in with her dad. She continued to insist that she wouldn't be living here.I know that at a certain age children can choose which parent they want to be with, but I really don't think her dad can seriously take her in full time given his living situation.  Her mom caught part of this conversation and immediately pulled her into a room and had a private talk with her, but she continued to be cold with me. Based on what I heard from 13yo, her dad has been poisoning the well against me and I feel helpless to do anything about it.I know she will never call me dad or anything obviously, but am I stupid to want to have a good relationship with her in the future? Is 13yo too old to form some sort of familial connection at all? I am clueless about how to navigate this and I could really use some advice...TLDR: Future step daughter wants nothing to do with me before even getting to know me and I really want to have a positive relationship with her.444 commentssharesavehidereport95% Upvoted
itqqji,768Posted by1 year agoArchivedI'm [47M] concerned that my wife [46F] has been emotionally cheating -- What to do?
              
            RelationshipsA bit of our background:We started dating in 1992, we went to the same school for a year, then in 1994 I moved to another town to attend a different school. We got engaged and she moved in with me in 1995, and we've been together ever since.Things were great until 2015 when we were out at a pub and she met a guy (a friend of friends). They started texting multiple times a day for months (I didn't realize this until much later). Being pretty dense, it took me a while to realize that every time her phone would light up with a notification, she'd run to the restroom and be in there for a long time. I finally noticed the pattern, eventually confronted her, and we went to counseling. She seemed to realize that what they were doing was inappropriate. Things seemed good again (albeit a bit at arms-length).I've recently come to discover that she's been texting with her "friend from school" for the last year (whom she met whilst I was away, before she moved in with me). After the 2015 incident, I've been on high alert, so I've been telling myself that we're good, and that he's just a friend.What's got me worried is that she's never written to him in my presence, and she gets really flustered and defensive when I see her FB Messenger app notification, and ask who she's chatting with. She'll reluctantly say it's "her friend from school" with no further details. A lot of times, when I come into the room she's in, she'll scramble to close apps on her phone, then she'll run to the bathroom and be in there for a long time. When I do catch a rare glimpse of their chat, it's littered with heart emojis.It seems to be a repeat of 2015 all over again. She also seems more physically distant, but since we're only "intimate" every 2-3 months or so, it's hard to tell.Does this sound like I should be concerned, or am I being paranoid after the last episode?144 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted

It made a clicking noise when he stopped it. He wouldn't tell me what it was. Does anyone have any idea what this could be? I thought a camera, but I don't know why he was using this and not his phone.Our relationship is pretty much done and he is very angry and... mean. He still has access to our place, and we haven't "officially" broken up. I am trying to extricate myself from him, but this type of behavior has me concerned and I'm treading carefully.Tl;dr Bf is spying on me? I'm really creeped outEdit: just want to say thank you so much to everyone who commented helping me figure this out and reinforcing what I know to be true (it is past time to get away from him). I am definitely going to tread carefully because not knowing what he's capable of is actually more scary than anything he's done before.

ih7ocl,760Posted by1 year agoArchivedComments are lockedMy boyfriend (27M) is asking me (23F) to pay half the rent and I think it may be unfair
              
            [new]Me and my boyfriend moved together like six months ago. He works a full time job and I work around 25-30 hours. The reason why I didn't get a full time job is because soon I'll go back to study so I decided to stay in that job.When we talked about moving together we decided that we would split rents 65/35 approximately because he makes way more money than me and I couldn't afford living in a place like that or even paying half the rent.Nothing changed. We still have the same jobs but now he's demanding me to pay half the rent. I'm not sure why. He seems very irritated at me. I've been noticing this for a few days but I don't know why he has been so fixated with the rent. I'm not sure what to tell him because I can't afford living in his place. And half the rent is too much. I feel like this is unfair because we agreed from the start to this. If I got a better job or if I was given a raise then sure I would pay more. But that's not the case.I've been thinking if moving out but I don't know when I will be able to find a room or apartment. And also I'm not sure how this will affect the relationship because I would have to move away from his area to afford something.Is this unfair or I'm being unreasonable? And I'm not sure of what to do from now on. What should I tell him? The easiest option would be moving out but even that is difficult.TL;DR my boyfriend lives in an expensive area. When we moved together we agreed to pay around 65/35 each. Now he's demanding to pay half and half but I can't afford it. Is this unfair? I am not sure. And I'm not sure what's the best solution.68 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
k05640,757Posted by11 months agoArchivedFriend (30M) has proposed after 6 years of infidelity to friend (26F)
              
            Personal issuesThis is a really difficult situation so I hope you lot can set me straight. My "friend" Chris (30M) has proposed to Amy (26F) and she has no idea who he is.Chris always said he would tell Amy before marrying her and he has said nothing. He's clever in that he's managed to make the Amy see the world and people the way he wants her too. This is a guy you would find sucking on a random girls tits in a local clubs smoking area on a night out when you turn up. He would always brag about his numbers to everyone/strangers. Send victory snaps of girls hes slept with naked to the other boys. Talk about his girlfriend like she was beneath him even when in hospital. And everyone knows. I've sent Amy anonymous messages twice saying he's cheating. Dropped numerous hints myself. Yet he's only been caught once and she forgave him and blamed the other girl.He has also told the group he suffers anxiety now and doesn't cheat. But he has a completely separate friendship group and I'm sure he still does this stuff with them. If we were to give him the benefit of the doubt, the last time he did something was 2 years ago - again playing with a girls tits in the smoking area. So at most that's 6 years or cheating. I could literally go on forever listing the things he has and still does to maintain this illusion for Amy as well.Do I just tell her straight and nuke the whole thing? My own girlfriends mental health is quite fragile. And I'm picking up pieces of my broken family. My friends who know them say I should be happy for them. My other friendship group just say cut them all off and not attend which is what I think is most reasonable. Either way I'm complicit and awful. Any insight would be appreciated.Tl;dr guy has proposed to a girl he's cheated on for 6 years. What is the right course of action128 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
nldn80,758Posted by5 months agoComments are lockedI (23F) had a one night stand with a guy (25M) and later found out he has a long term girlfriend. Should I tell her?
              
            Personal issuesThrowaway account for obvious reasons.A few weeks ago, I was at a bar with some friends and this really handsome, charming guy approached me and brought me a drink. We we're chatting and then he suddenly kissed me, and we exchanged numbers.Later that night, I was at home and he texted me asking if I wanted to meet up. I did. I gave him my address and he came over. We had a drink, and then we had sex. He was surprised when I asked him to use a condom. He said "how cute, you're so careful" and I just laughed it off and said "I don't know you, and you don't know me".Anyway after that, he went home. During the week, I was scrolling through Facebook on my lunch break and he came up as a suggested friend (probably because his number is in my phone). I clicked on his profile, and he's in a relationship. He's been with this girl since 2017, and she posts about him a lot. She looks to be very much in love with him.I know he's probably sleeping with other women aside from me, he was so swift in the way he came in, got me a drink, kissed me and got my number that I feel he's done it plenty of times before. I'm shocked that he didn't intend on using a condom, I don't have an STD but he doesn't know that, and he was just willing to risk giving an STD to his girlfriend. Maybe he has already. I'm also not on any birth control pill so his willingness to take that risk was surprising.I was so torn about what to do in this scenario. I considered making a burner Facebook account and messaging her. Or not getting involved at all. Or asking him what's going on. I didn't decide on a solution. And then this weekend that just passed, he messaged me again on Saturday night, asking me to come out with him. I left him on read.Should I message her? Do I do it from a fake account?TL;DR I had sex with a dude and later found out he has a girlfriend. He didn't intend on using a condom. He texted me again this past weekend. Wondering if I should tell the gf.198 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
ixwt1j,748Posted by1 year agoArchivedMy [27F] husband’s [32M] friend [26F] just died. I think he was in love with her
              
            RelationshipsPlease tell me if I’m overreacting or seeing things that aren’t there. I guess that is possible, and that’s why I post here. Oh also we have been together for 7 years married for 4.My husband had this coworker/friend for about 3 years, let’s call her Helen. I did not know too much about her tbh. I know she joined his team at work and they started to become friends. They shared a hobby that I don’t share and they sometimes met up for that. Sometimes 1 on 1 and sometimes with other coworkers. I just saw her a couple of times. I did get a jealous gut feeling - also because she was attractive and charming - sometimes but there was no real evidence for something weird going on, and I have a bunch of male coworker friends too who he was always cool with too so I told myself there was nothing going on. I did not get the impression that they were overly close, it mostly just seemed like a mostly casual coworker friendship.Two weeks ago he got the news that she passed away in an accident. He actually had a day off and I was around when he got the phone call, he instantly became deathly pale and just collapsed and started screaming/crying. He is normally not a guy who expresses emotions strongly so it caught me by surprise but off anyone would react emotional on hearing about a friend’s death. And yet I now cannot stop comparing it to the time he learned of his actual brother’s death a few years ago, the two were pretty close but he reacted much less and barely shed tears. Anyway, that alone wouldn’t mean anything but afterwards a few things piled up that make me feel strange.I learned later from one of his coworkers that he immediately offered to adopt Helen’s daughter (she was a single mother) he has not told me about this or consulted me beforehand. However apparently it is already decided who the daughter will go to anyway.He has written to her parents and asked them for something to ‘remember her by’I saw an email from an artist indicating he has commissioned him to paint a portrait of herSince her death he has barely been eating or sleeping and seems to be in extreme grief altogether. He starts crying multiple times every day and is barely able to function. I would expect this level of grief after the death of a family member/spouse, not necessarily after a casual friend like she seemed to be, especially from himTo be honest maybe I would think less like this if our marriage hadn’t felt a little loveless in a while. He just does not seem overly interested in me anymore since one or two years. We still have sex and he kisses/cuddles me but it seems mechanical. I felt like he has been distracted by something and wasn’t really actually seeing me most of the time.So how the hell do I handle this? Do I shut up and just try to work on reviving our marriage? If there was nothing going on and he is truly just grieving a friend I would of course look like a total asshole if I bring this up in any way.tl,dr: Husband’s coworker/friend died and from his reaction I feel like he was in love with her. What do I do?194 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
i157f9,745Posted by1 year agoArchivedi've(27f) just realised that my friend(26m) of 3 years uses me as a backup for when he doesn't have anyone else to hang out with
              
            [new]I'm very much an introvert, I don't have many friends, but the ones I do have, I am very close to.One of these is a bit flaky, but he told me he was suffering from depression and frequent panic attacks, so when he cancelled last minute, I would be supportive. He would tell me that he couldn't get out of bed, couldn't see people, wouldn't be good company etc.We've known each other for 3 years and this happened relatively frequently.We both moved to different countries for a bit, but would visit each other and hang out.  We changed a lot, I focused on my career, he became a model (yay to being white in an asian country) started doing some drugs but was still a chill personRecently I moved to his country for work. We made plans to meet up my first evening there, but he was 'tired from work', he rearranged to the next day, that day, he 'finished late' and had to wake up early the next day, so rearranged to the next evening. That day I met some people and we went for a hike, they wanted to get food after, and I felt like I was making friends pretty easily, but had plans with the og friend. Knowing how flaky he was I text and he replied that he was just finishing at work and would head right over. I excused myself and went to the meeting point. 15 mins after he was meant to be there I messaged and he told me he was too tired and wouldn't be good company.I was pretty pissed off and replied with 'fine' but then said i'd like to see him anyway. He didn't reply for a while which was strange as he wasn't meant to be doing anything.Checked my whatsapp and had a message from a different friend saying that she'd seen him in someone's IG story that day (she was telling me because shes paranoid about covid and he was with a bunch of people).I asked him what he was doing and he claimed he was just getting off the train from work.Sent him the screenshot of him hanging out with friends. No reply.3 years of 'friendship' and this is what he does. I wasted 3 of my evenings waiting for him and he was just seeing people he actually liked.I'm so hurt, as I genuinely thought we were close. We'd ring each other after breakups, talk for hours etc. and now he's behaving like this...I just feel so gullible and used.tl;dr friend of 3 years makes plans with me and flakes at the last minute for what sound like valid reasons.  turns out he just got a better offer to hang out with his 'cool' friends so ditched me.190 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
i2ymiq,736Posted by1 year agoArchivedComments are lockedSaying I love you too soon
              
            [new]I'll try and keep this short.I (28F) started seeing my bf (39) last December. I'm a teacher and his daughter (6) was in my class last school year. He also had a son (3) He's a single father and the children's Mum passed away a couple of years ago.We bumped into each other in a pub just before Christmas and hit it off and started dating. We've been taking it quite slow, going on 1 or 2 dates a week and messaging/talking. No sex but plenty of kissing and that.You know what happened and we couldn't see each other for a few months but have been talking everyday. Anyway we decided that it would be nice for me to meet the children as his partner as the next step.So he cooked dinner for us all last night and it was amazing. The children are really sweet and seemed genuinely exited I was there,  the daughter especially seemed super pleased to see me.Just watching this "mans man" (I don't know a better  way to describe it, I hope you know what I mean) with his children just made me want him more. Was almost a different person but not, if that makes sense. The final straw was hearing him singing the bedtime song to his son when he tucked him in, was adorable!Once he'd put both children to bed I teased him on whether I could get a bed time song too and got the answer  I was hoping for which was basically inviting me to stay the night (I'm not going to lie, I was so incredibly turned on by this stage, is that even normal?)After an amazing night we were all cuddled up in bed   and I just said "I love you" I didn't plan on saying it, it just came out in the moment.He didn't say anything at first but he did seem to hold me a little tighter and after a while said "You're amazing" we fell asleep snuggled up (and woke up the same which was super nice too) but I'm a bit worried I may have scared him off. I mean who says I love you after the first time having sex? How should I address this? Should I address this?Tldr: I said I love you way early in a relationship and am worried I may have scared my bf off!45 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted

            RelationshipsYesterday my boyfriend and I were arguing over something small on text and he called me and completely went off on me for five minutes straight yelling at the top of his lungs. We have had issues with him yelling two times before and he knows it’s a strong boundary for me. I was crying so I wasn’t talking, and he knew I was crying but just kept yelling. When we got off the phone I felt sick to my stomach and had anxiety in my chest from the yelling. I’ve seen him twice since then, and when I look at him I feel nothing. I don’t feel anger or happiness or love I just feel numb. Like he’s a random person to me. We have talked about it and he says sorry but I should understand because he’s under a lot of stress. I don’t know if this feeling is going to go away and I can get those feelings back or if I should just call it quits now. If anyone has experience with this or advice please let me know.  We have only been together for three months.tl;dr boyfriend yelled at me and now i have no feelings towards him191 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
mdkjci,718Posted by7 months agoArchivedComments are lockedMy friend is getting scammed, how can I help her understand?
              
            Non-RomanticTL;DR - My friend has the IQ of a teenager. She is in the middle of a sweetheart scam. She isn't aware of it. She lost thousands of dollars, money she doesn't have! She is getting sucked for more money. No one is willing to give her money so she is trying to get a loan. No one is able to talk any sense into her, including her brother, dad, and closest friends. I am a trusted family friend, and somehow I became the only competent person able to deal with this situation. But I am just an average dude. Help me get through to her without crushing her.Longer version:I have been dealing with this issue for 2 full days, and I'm exhausted. Long story short, I have a very very simple minded friend. She's 32, but probably has the IQ of a 12 year old. Not being mean, I just need help dealing with this situation, and I need to tell it as is. She is in the middle of a sweetheart scam, and they have scammed her of a huge amount of money she doesn't have. It's basically her dad's money that was meant to pay rent and emergency bills. The scammers got her to download a sketchy app, where she deposited the money despite getting warning messages from the bank that the receiver's info is sketchy and likely to be a scam. She OK'd the transaction despite the bank warning.She's in love with this guy she met online a few months ago. Has seen one picture of him, and they have never facetimed. One time she went to his city (long distance relationship) to visit him. They planned to meet up. However, when that day came, "he was too busy with work" to meet up. Surprise surprise. She still believes this guy.Trust me, that I am 100% sure she is being scammed. The problem is how do I break it to her? Somehow, I became the most competent person in dealing with this issue. I am looking for advice on how to approach this situation to her.So far, I have already mentioned to her that she was being scammed. It two days ago when I first learned about it when she called me. She explained the situation to me, and as she was doing so, I said it sounds like a textbook scam. She didn't really have any response, and tends to withdraw like a deer in headlights whenever I mention the word scam.I briefly talked to her today with a different approach. I asked her how much she trusts me, her dad, her brother, and her bf. She trusts us, but she said she "doesn't know how to answer" when when I asked about trusting the bf. I didn't press further. I asked a similar question: Would your dad ever hurt you? "No." Your brother? "No." Me? "No." Would your bf ever hurt you? "I don't know how to answer that." I didn't press further. In hindsight, it sounds like an interrogation. I felt like this was a bad approach.So I changed it up by asking things in a lighter/fun tone like do you like him a lot? "Somewhat." Is he handsome? "I don't know! I don't care about looks?" Have you asked for his picture? "Of course not! How can I ask him that?" I told her that if my gf never asks me for a picture, it's a sign she isn't interested in me. She said that makes sense and she never thought about it that way.Essentially I'm discretely trying to get her to become suspicious of why this guy never shows what he looks like to her. I wonder if this is the right approach. The other approach is to just tell her it's a scam and show her all the evidence I have collected, and link her to articles about these scams she's in. I felt like that approach would be worse. I am not a professional, just a normal average dude who went through some therapy so I have some empathy for her. I'm trying to ease her into the truth rather than just dump it all on her at once.I need advice on how to move forward.[EDIT] I have skimmed through most of the comments- 100+ is a lot to read on little time. Thanks for all the help. Some things to point out:- Many have noted some kind of Adult Protection Service. I think this is the path their family needs to go through.- Regarding her mental capacity- I mentioned she has a low IQ because of this incident and just from general contact with her. She is just simple minded. I am not aware of her being diagnosed with any mental disability, or taking and IQ tests that show she has low IQ. So my comment was more of an observation.134 commentssharesavehidereport97% Upvoted
o3nr2n,764Posted by4 months ago3I (25M) asked my best friends to be at my moms funeral, and they both didn’t show up. What do I do?
              
            [new]They said they would go too. I’ve been friends with them for almost 10 years. The first one, who I live with, apparently just forgot. And the second one I guess had work. At a job that they quit months later.I quickly forgave them because I need my friends right now to survive this.But now those feelings are coming up again. Especially since recently it’s felt like they’ve been excluding me from hanging out with them.I got into a fight with one of them months later when he was pressuring me to go camping. Ive got a lot of responsibilities to myself right now. But He wasn’t taking no for an answer and kept trying to guilt trip me. He was getting angry at me for not wanting to go out with him. But I’m not in the “going out’ kind of mood right now. Not at this point in my life for fucks same. We ended up getting over the fight but still. I’m sick of forgiving these guys. This isn’t the first time they’ve let me down either.I’m still grieving and religiously trying to workout/cook/go to therapy and heal. Desperately. Because I’m incredibly alone now. I’m in a state I didn’t grow up in. My partner of 2 years cheated on me so I left her. My dad ran away to Greece and I haven’t seen him in years. The only family member I have in the entire world is my sister. I love her so much and I’m so lucky to have her in my life. But I feel so fucking alone still. On top of that the dog(15F) I grew up with and had since I (25M) was 10 is terminally ill and I might have to put her down soon. She’s a lot of work and high maintenance but I love her like you could love a sibling. This is just such a heart breaking fucking time and I’m trying not to break.That’s why this is so hard. I’ve lost so much in life. Friends are important to me. This fucking sucks. This is partly a rant so I can just let this out. There’s no easy answer, I know what I might need to do. It’s just so fucking hard sometimes.Edit: Thank you all for the helpful advice. I’m getting the help I need and keeping to myself. Not acting out in emotion but letting out emotion when I need in a healthy way. Thank you for this community, feels good to be heard.TL;DRI (25M) asked my best friends to be at my moms funeral, and they both didn’t show up.86 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
n82liq,718Posted by5 months agoI (23F)got assaulted by my ex(25M) and my boyfriend(31M) isn't taking it seriously.
              
            RelationshipsTo make a long story short, on my way home from my boyfriends place my ex saw me and decieded he was going to follow me home. He is homeless and a drug at the moment. He would leave me alone and at some point on the bus ride he was screaming at me and pushed me in the forehead. The bus driver was no help and only one of the passengers tried to help me. I was taken to hospital and diagnosed with a concussion.On Thursday they released him from custody. He's still being charged but no longer held. This has been causing a lot of excess stress. My life has changed because of the situation and I feel embarrassed, humiliated and vulnerable. When I told my boyfriend about the situation he thought I was being dramatic about my injuries and that they weren't so bad and that I was a pussy for not wanting take the bus again.I'm trying to convince him that I'm in danger and that I have to take procausions. I can't travel alone anymore. Its a four hour commute to his place. A lot can happen. Bus stops are also where my ex begs and Ubers are too exspensive. He doesn't want to pick me up and take me to his place.TL;DR: I don't know how to help my boyfriend realize that I'm not safe and that I need him to step things up so that I can be safe.Edit: the bus ride to his place is a four hour commute. Driving you can get their in 45 minutes to an hour. He Just told me yesterday that the reason he doesn't want to commute is that his mother is really sick and he doesn't want to be far from home. I was also punched in the head not pushed.142 commentssharesavehidereport95% Upvoted
mfgfef,708Posted by7 months agoArchived5UPDATE on dead-end, age gap relationship
              
            BreakupsOriginal post hereI (27F) posted a while back about my boyfriend (50M) being indifferent about marriage and only willing to get married to appease me. Among some other relationship challenges, this became a dealbreaker for me, and I have broken up with him since my post.This has hands-down been the most difficult breakup I’ve ever gone through. We only dated for two years, but I felt like we were together much longer. I had a very strong connection with him, and breaking up was heart-wrenching, because I still have feelings for him. Still, I know it was the best decision for me. The pain is still there, however, and he is not making things easy for me.I have moved out of his house (which I lived in and contributed to financially for the duration of our relationship). I miss him terribly, as he had become my best friend and confidante over the last couple years. Despite my repeated discussions and explanations regarding my reasons for wanting to break up, he continues to make himself the victim. He says he feels used, and when I try to explain my own despair over having to end the relationship, he simply says, “It’s okay. I always get hurt eventually. I’ve come to expect it.” He also thinks I am being unreasonable about marriage, and that he “put up” with a lot in our relationship, but that I was not willing to put up with his aversion to marriage. When I asked him what he put up with, he cited a 6-month period where I struggled with depression and he had to provide me with more support than normal. I am appalled that he would hold that over me like I was just being lazy that whole time or something. He said it affected him too, but seems to have no regard for how it affected me—the actual person with a mental health issue.He also said that even if he had wanted to be married, he wouldn’t have considered it yet, because I hadn’t put in enough time in the relationship to earn his trust. He said I was being impatient and insensitive to the fact that a marriage is inconvenient for a man of his age, and that weddings are expensive. He acted like I was going to make him pay entirely for a lavish wedding and then divorce him and sue him for everything he has. It hurts that he really thinks I am capable of such things, and that he clearly thinks I didn’t love him. If I just wanted to use him for his money or whatever, I would still be with him.Clearly there were some resentful feelings there that have only come to light since our breakup. I know I made the right decision, but I could use some cheering up from the Reddit community. These last few weeks have been horrible. I lost my best friend and partner, and I feel like he has turned completely against me and marred all the good memories I have of him. I have also been tossed out of my home and forced to look for a new one at an incredibly emotional time. If any of you have some advice, encouraging words, or anything uplifting to say, it would be greatly appreciated.I would also like to thank the Redditors who commented on my previous post and gave me the courage to do something difficult and painful that will ultimately lead me down the path that’s best for me.TL;DR: I broke up with my boyfriend that didn’t want the same things as me, but now I’m left feeling lonely and heartbroken. Please offer any kind words or sentiments you may have.144 commentssharesavehidereport92% Upvoted
hr8dzh,699Posted by1 year agoArchivedHow to tell my sister (29F) that I think the reason she doesn't get second dates is because she's accidentally a catfish
              
            Non-RomanticOriginally posted to r/dating_advice but realized it probably fit better here.My sister has been using dating apps for around 6 years now and I'm almost positive that she has been using the same pictures throughout this entire time.She has gained a significant amount of weight since those pictures. I truly think she's still very beautiful and has the most amazing personality. I love her so much, she's so smart and kind and successful. But she always gets discouraged because she goes on these dates and almost always they text her after saying they didn't feel chemistry beyond friends.I've heard from a lot of people before that that's what they say to someone that doesn't look like their pictures. She's very self conscious about her body and doesn't take new pictures of herself. I've offered to do a fun, casual photo shoot but she says no.I'm not sure how to offer the suggestion she needs updated pictures without hurting her feelings.ETA:  she is constantly complaining to me about her dating life and how she's unattractive and that's why people don't like her, but the issue is that they are getting someone that they're not expecting. My SO of 1.5 years I met after having dating apps for 2 weeks and she compares herself to that a lot.TL;DR my sister needs to update her dating profile pics. how do i tell her153 commentssharesavehidereport98% Upvoted
k7ynxu,701Posted by10 months agoArchivedMy (26F) boss’ (27M) girlfriend (20sF) won’t stop harassing me.
              
            Personal issuesI’m a personal assistant and I’ve worked for my boss for 3 years. He has an (ex?) girlfriend who he has been dating for around a year. She’s never liked me and is always complaining about certain things I do for my boss, despite these things being a part of my job description.Recently they had a massive fight and she decided to harass me over text. She’s convinced we’re having an affair because of something he said to her and is calling me a homewrecker and a wh***. She wouldn’t stop even after I corrected her and politely asked her to stop involving me in their relationship drama, so I had to ask him to ask her to stop.I think they broke up because now she has her friends harassing me too. They keep pressuring me to quit because she thinks they can’t be together unless I do now. They’ve been spamming me on social media and calling and texting me to the point where it’s interfering with work. She’s even shown up whilst I was working to accuse me of things. It’s been a big mess and I really just want her to stop.I’m honestly considering quitting because it’s getting too much for me now, especially since they’ve been harassing my boyfriend and he broke up with me over the things she was saying. How do I get them to stop? Also, how do I fix things with my boyfriend?TL;DR – Boss’ ex(?) girlfriend is convinced we’re having an affair and won’t stop harassing me now.86 commentssharesavehidereport99% Upvoted

            BreakupsMy gf (26f) and i (26m) been dating for 2 years we love each other a lot and got used to one another. However few months ago i realized that i don't see a future with her. We have a lot of differences and goals for example i want kids but she never want to have, i want us to live together but she refuses to move in , our sex is not joinable at all she rarely wants to have sex ..etcthere are other reasons. But whenever i talk about ending things for good she keeps crying and keep pushing me to stay and promise that things will be different and get better but they never do. I tried to break up with her like 10 times already and never succeeded. What can i do? I do love her and get weak when she cries but i don't see a future with her at all.TLDR;  i talked with her and the same thing she loves me and we should stay together  i feel trapped .231 commentssharesavehidereport96% Upvoted
