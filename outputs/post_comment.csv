kqkj9c,I‚Äôm going though a breakup that has left me feeling lost and broken. This gives me so much hope for the future. Tomorrow morning my journey begins as I go talk to a therapist for the first time and begin the road to recovery. Thank you for being so strong and sharing your story so others may find their strength through you. You‚Äôre amazing.
kqkj9c,So many people told me things would get better, but honestly, I didn‚Äôt believe it until I started feeling it myself. Just keep putting that faith in yourself and remember you‚Äôre so much stronger than you think! You‚Äôve already done the biggest step‚Äîsigning up for therapy!
kqkj9c,While overall having a partner is superior to being single for a lot of people and what they're eventually looking for, there are lots of great things about flying solo.  This just gives you an opportunity to experience some of those things and appreciate them to the fullest before you find the right person for you.
kqkj9c,THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY. GOOD FOR YOU, OP!! You rock.
kqkj9c,Thank you. I forgot to mention above, but I also got a new job offer and am happily busy with fulfilling work again as well!
kqkj9c,Yay!!!!!!!! Congrats!!!There's nothing like living alone in your own, perfect space, amirite??
kqkj9c,My bedroom is so damn feminine now and I LIVE FOR IT.
kqkj9c,It made me sad reading in your last post that you were worried about overanalyzing the times you might have looked pathetic to him. For starters he was pathetic for doing that to you and it's not pathetic being lied to, manipulated and gaslighted. So I'm glad after reading this post that you see it as his failure and not yours because that's exactly it. You've done nothing wrong and you're well rid of this guy. I'm happy you're doing so well. You sound awesome.
kqkj9c,Yeah, that line about seeing the divorce as a failure, and then realizing that he failed. That is the best take away that OP and anyone else going through something similar can have. I didn't fail, they did.....very powerful message!
kqkj9c,I read the earlier post, then this. What a great happy ending. I love the way you see it, as a new beginning and his failure not yours.  I believe that it's 100% true and very helpful to see it in that light. I wish you the best, but it sounds like you've already got it.Well done!
kqkj9c,I am so happy for you! Thanks for the lovely update!
kqkj9c,might like r/BestofRedditorUpdates
kqkj9c,I am so happy you are in a happy and healthy place
kqkj9c,I'm so happy for you. Women have the capacity to really bounce back and come out in a better state.Your ex husband will come back begging,  and I'm not kidding. He will come with his hat in his hand. Be prepared for it.
kqkj9c,People keep saying this, but honestly I don‚Äôt think he will. I think he‚Äôs just wiped his hands clean, which in a weird way has made it easier for me to move on. I did make it hopefully hard to find me if he does decide otherwise though.
kqkj9c,Mine never did. Because he found a new narcissistic supply, so I was useless to him. Never been SO happy to be found useless.
kqkj9c,They always do and it's my experience that almost every time they do, it doesn't work. Something extremely fragile broke and it's almost impossible to repair it. Some marriages have bounced back from cheating but I don't think it's the majority of themI also think that if it was easy for them to cheat once, what guarantees you that given the chance, it won't happen again. Can you imagine the level of anxiety said doubt would bring? At least, knowing myself I wouldn't be able to live doubting all the time. It's a huge leap of faith.
l4wa08,The update no one knew they needed
l4wa08,but my life is more complete now knowing
l4wa08,This is so random lmao
l4wa08,Updates like this to seemingly irrelevant, old posts are pure gold
l4wa08,I love the commitment to the post..... and to the husband üòÇ
l4wa08,I just want to see the before and after, I'm intrigued af now
l4wa08,I want to see too!Maybe OP can entice him to curl them again and snap a pic, and she can crop that photo and one of his normal lashes to show just his eyes in both so we can compare lol
l4wa08,Thank god, I've been on the edge of my seat for the last 5 years. Glad you guys got married and things are OK.Give us another update in 5 years when you've got a house and a couple kids?
l4wa08,We need to know if the kids get your lashes or his
l4wa08,Or if they have no kids and spend their money taking those eyes around the world.
l4wa08,I'd definitely tell him how much you like his curled eyelashes.My husband was desperately in need of a haircut, but I honestly didn't realize just how desperately until he got it and I couldn't stop staring at him. I'd forgotten how breath taking he can be. He played like he was uncomfortable with me staring, but I'm pretty sure he enjoyed it, too.
l4wa08,Isn‚Äôt that the best feeling?  Seeing your SO in a new light after a simple haircut or shave?
l4wa08,This is adorable. I hope you told him he was breathtaking! I've heard most men don't hear compliments about their appearances very often, and try to give them the same positive feedback I'd give a female friend.
l4wa08,Are you secretly married to Keanu Reeves?
l4wa08,this is hilarious, thank you so much for updating us 5 years later
l4wa08,I put make up on my husband once. Curled his eyelashes and mascara and liner and everything. He had lashes for days and his eyes were stunning. I told him he couldn‚Äôt wear make up anymore because I didn‚Äôt like that he was prettier than me hahaha
l4wa08,Idk why but I expected a before and after picture
lxp1ee,That‚Äôs a great update. I can promise you that the one month relationship would have never worked out, because it didn‚Äôt. And how it ended suggests that it never had staying power.I hope that getting into shape helps you both. I think the pandemic also makes relationships tough because you‚Äôre likely no longer getting out and doing the things that brought you together (or, simply having time apart and separate interests). At least that‚Äôs been the case with my marriage! I think that would make it tempting to fantasize about some other reality that ‚Äúcould have‚Äù been (but really, it could have never been).
lxp1ee,The fantasy is what kills us. It never plays out like it does in our heads. I mean, I even ruin potential relationships before they happen because I fantasize about what it "could be" and then get disappointed. It's easy to get huge crushes on people because we fantasize about what they might be like. But then when we get to know the person we've been imagining things about we realize it's all a lie and the lust/crush fades away.... I bet OP is fantasizing just like this about that girl and in reality, they could've ended up having a terrible relationship or just platonic.
lxp1ee,Aww, that's great! Enjoy your fitness journey together and your vacation!
lxp1ee,I learned a technique for getting stuff that keeps popping into your head to go away. It worked for me, and it helped my brother with something too.Step 1. Get a minimum of 15 minutes where you won't be interrupted, sit down and start writing your thoughts on it down. Write it down with an actual pen and paper - not on a computer. Just write whatever comes to mind, but keep writing for 15 minutes. If you run out of things to write, just repeat yourself, it's fine.Step 2. Burn the paper. Literally burn it. Careful not to burn your house down.Step 3. Do this every day or every other day until you've done it at least 4 times.The psychologist that told me this technique explained that often when you have thoughts that keep coming back over and over, it's because instead of processing them to a conclusion, you're stuck in a mental loop that is self-reinforcing. By writing things down in an uninterrupted fashion, and in a method where you can be completely honest with yourself because you know no one will ever see it, you help yourself develop a mental path out of those thoughts.I've used this twice, and it's worked both times.Edit: Meant to add that personally, burning the paper felt cathartic too. Not sure if that actually is part of why it worked, but it felt good.
lxp1ee,I love this! I always get so self-conscious when I'm trying to journa or work out my thoughts regarding something upsetting because I start to wonder who might read it some day. Even if that person is just future-me, I feel like it makes me feel less free to just write how I'm actually feeling.Lighting anything on fire in my apartment makes me feel a little uncomfortable, but I'm sure there's a way to do it safely...
lxp1ee,This is kind of like a ritual I do on full moons. I write things and thoughts on paper that I want to get rid of... and I burn them. I've been doing it on and off for years and it's a nice way to let go!  I think burning the paper helps release it, at least for me. "It" literally disappears.
lxp1ee,I needed to hear this today thank you
lxp1ee,This is amazing. I had an intrusive thought very similar to yours of dating someone for a month over a year ago. I got ghosted right before the pandemic hit, and I never got over it. Even went to therapy for a couple months about it.I tried your technique just now and laughed out loud when I reread the start of the page. I couldn't believe how angry I was just 15 minutes earlier, because by the end I was writing about forgiveness and looking forward to better things. The burning was pretty fun too. Thanks so much for the tip, I feel like a different person already. Will definitely continue tomorrow!
lxp1ee,cries in carpal tunnel
lxp1ee,I'm trying that! Happy cake day :)
lxp1ee,This is what we call magick
lxp1ee,That is fascinating‚Äîthanks!
lxp1ee,Midlife crisis can be debilitating. Glad you guys are coming out stronger.
lxp1ee,Are you still obsessing over the girl from 16 years ago?
lxp1ee,Nope.After my wife and I talked, we had really passionate sex and all thoughts are pretty much gone
lxp1ee,Outstanding proactive choices by both of you! Bravo!
hxzwcl,The end of a relationship is hard but it‚Äôs also such a great opportunity for growth, self compassion, and fun. The initial part of the separation is hard but just know that you will be okay, slowly things will get better. You‚Äôre still so young, you‚Äôre going to find someone that‚Äôs a better match for you. Just give yourself time to grieve and take care of yourself. When my bf and I broke up I listened to ‚ÄúBreakup Recover Podcast‚Äù by Barbara Stevens, she‚Äôs so calming and has a way of making you feel cared for and safe. There were days where I felt like shit but I would force myself to listen to it and I never regretted it. Hope you find happiness within yourself soon!
hxzwcl,Thank you very much!
hxzwcl,Thank you for sharing what sounds like an incredible resource! I love podcasts
hxzwcl,I‚Äôve come to know that most relationships are temporary, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt spark joy and laughter. This decision was hard to come to but the love and care you have for each other will always remain.  Allow yourself to truly experience self discovery and to focus on bettering it- take a class, learn a new language, try to find new and exciting purposes.
hxzwcl,Definitely will. Thank you so much!
hxzwcl,My grandparents were married for 40+ years. My grandpa passed a few years ago and my poor 87 year old grandma has been depressed ever since. Even after 40 years, relationships are temporary and that makes me sad
hxzwcl,I read your original post and I just want to say that I‚Äôm sorry and I‚Äôm really proud of you. You know that you have done absolutely everything you could have done to try and maintain this marriage. As you move forward in your life you won‚Äôt need to question if it was something you did or if there was something you could have done better; this marriage ending is completely on her. You are willing to take criticism and improve on your shortcomings, you compromise and work as a team player, you persevere and you show compassion. You are a wonderful partner and now you‚Äôll have the freedom to find someone who will be just as willing as you to put everything into your relationship. I wish you all the best as you heal and eventually feel ready to find someone new!
hxzwcl,Thank you!
hxzwcl,This is so true, dont sell yourself short. Some people will look back with regret and wonder if they could do more. Be content that you tried your best (or the best you could give at the time).
hxzwcl,I got divorced at 28 (my partner also requested it after I felt I had done everything I could do) and it was hard at the time but ended up being the absolute best thing that ever happened to me. Hang in there, treat yourself kindly and follow your dreams, I'm sure you will thrive. All the best.
hxzwcl,Thank you and I will try to!
hxzwcl,You‚Äôre still so young! You‚Äôre only 26!!! You have you whole life, a positive attitude and a whole lot of life experience now!
hxzwcl,I read your original and update. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this but there‚Äôs still so much ahead of you. In time you might come to find this was the best thing for you.I‚Äôm your age and from age 17-25 I was with the same guy and although we didn‚Äôt actually make it to marriage we were pretty close with cohabitating and having a dog together etc. That relationship ended and it was very difficult but it has afforded me the opportunity to make changes in my life and finally live the way I wanted to. This is all to say that you should keep hopeful and work on yourself. Good things are still to come!
hxzwcl,Thank you! I will continue to move forward and try to remain as positive as I can throughout the process.
hxzwcl,I‚Äôm 32 and have to start over too. We‚Äôll be ok!
hxzwcl,Yes we will! If you need someone to talk to feel free to reach out.
hxzwcl,30 here, currently clearing out house.
hxzwcl,Hey! You will be okay! As time passes you‚Äôll see how happy you‚Äôre going to be instead of dragging this unhappy marriage around! You did your part. Take time for yourself  and eventually when you least expect  it you‚Äôll find the person who gives you what you deserve! Positive vibes your way!!
hxzwcl,I‚Äôm so sorry to hear things didn‚Äôt turn out the way you wanted. Good job on focusing on the positive and I hope you enjoy life more than ever!
hxzwcl,Hey if you want to talk message me, I'm the same age and also going through divorce (my wife left me for another man) I've been trying to parse my feeling with my situation but maybe having someone to talk to might help both of us. If nothing else maybe we could give some insight to each other, I mean if you want it.
nhr3yo,I am glad but as a kid whose dream always was to become a paleontologist, may I ask - why do you want to kill the dinosaurs?
nhr3yo,I wish I had you as my mother. No I'm not gay but to take the time to learn from others on how to take care of your daughter lovingly is a really good trait and she is lucky that instead of you responding back in kind or from a place of negativity, you are responding with love.
nhr3yo,I wanna bake with OP too :(
nhr3yo,Same man. I hardly speak to my mom, it would be amazing to have one that's so loving and emotionally intelligent. You're an amazing woman, OP ‚ù§‚ù§
nhr3yo,I wish the same. My mom might be a narcissist so I‚Äôm still struggling with internalized shame. Her daughter is super lucky and OP and her husband seem like great parents.
nhr3yo,Me too - you sound like a wonderful mother OP and I‚Äôm so happy for your daughter
nhr3yo,Captain Bloody Obvious says: You‚Äôre good parents.
nhr3yo,Yep. This. Totally cried happy tears a lil bit :) this is what good parenting looks like!!
nhr3yo,Pregnant right now, and my hope is to be the kind of parent that my kid's friends can trust like this, and to be so compassionate and attentive as to know when things are "off" and have a relationship where they can come to me with hard things.It's not always simple or easy, but OP handled this so well on all fronts. Really inspiring
nhr3yo,This means more than you know
nhr3yo,I love hearing stories like this. My son came out to me at 15, I‚Äôm so glad he felt comfortable opening up to me. It‚Äôs so hard being a gay teenager, the world can be such a cruel place. But at least when they get the love and support at home, it makes it a little bit easier.
nhr3yo,Ah, so her comment about wanting to read those books was accurate. Maybe re-purchase the LGBTQ+ ones again so she can read them?Excellent parenting!
nhr3yo,These kinds of stories always make me really happy, but also a little jealous. I wonder how different my life would have been if I‚Äôd had parents that supported me when I came out. She‚Äôs lucky to have you both.
nhr3yo,I hope to be a mom one day. Every time I come across a post like this with excellent parenting I try to log it away in my memory bank as a standard to strive for. Your daughter is very lucky to have you.
nhr3yo,Maybe you should do something like start a journal with these ideas so you don't forget them. Could be a nice thing to update later once you have a kid, too!
nhr3yo,You have NO idea how much you have positively impacted these two girls' lives. Thank you so so much for adding so much good to the universe.
nhr3yo,Well done, Mom.  That's some fine momming.
nhr3yo,Aw now I see why your daughter was so upset, and I see why her gf was upset. Of course they should be able to tell everyone, but society is still a little behind and your daughter is rightfully nervous.Good on you for how you handled it.
nhr3yo,You are great parents üíï
l5jc7c,It was already broken and I fixed it.GOLD. What a perfect way to say it.
l5jc7c,Yes!!! Op, you are so awesome and this was such a wonderful update to read, rooting for you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
l5jc7c,Source
l5jc7c,Yes! You "fix" yourself. You "rescue" yourself. No one person will "complete" you - you are a whole person on your own. Don't rely on someone else to do the work YOU need to do.
l5jc7c,That's the line that stood out to me, too.
l5jc7c,My husband feels he‚Äôs entitled to another chance with me.Narrator: ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt‚Äù.
l5jc7c,Snowball on top of that.... ‚ÄúNo one is.‚Äù
l5jc7c,Let me guess, when he found out you found someone else he started freaking out and saying you were breaking the family? I had a friend like this. He cheated constantly and then she found someone else. Suddenly he was the victim crying to the friend group. He is not a friend anymore.
l5jc7c,He had a massive freak out when he found out I was seeing someone else. The irony is unreal.
l5jc7c,HAH what a loser. It‚Äôs always the world against them, no matter which way they manage to twist it, isn‚Äôt it
l5jc7c,I‚Äôm so happy that this had a happy ending for you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
l5jc7c,I remember reading your post ages ago. I‚Äôm so happy you were able to find stability and happiness despite how bad things got for you.Please continue to have a wonderful life ‚ú® you deserve it.
l5jc7c,Weirdly I happened to read the original yesterday when I fell down a Reddit wormhole!
l5jc7c,You probably won‚Äôt read this but this is exactly what I needed to hear at this exact moment in my life. I‚Äôm going through the same thing. Trying to leave but suffering the guilt and hearing his begging every day.But I already put down the deposit on my new place. I already bought my plane ticket. Just 3 more weeks and I‚Äôm free.I‚Äôve been doubting myself more than ever as the time approaches. So, like I said, I really needed this. Thanks.
l5jc7c,I am reading everyones comments. Don‚Äôt let anyone guilt you into doing what you feel is right. I had it coming from all sides (him, his family, his friends). You don‚Äôt owe anyone your love. You‚Äôre going to be so much better off, I promise. I‚Äôm rooting for you.
l5jc7c,You can do it, internet stranger. I am SO PROUD of you!!! 3 weeks is going to fly by!
l5jc7c,He's love-bombing you.  It's a strategy for keeping all his toys.  It's not real.Stay strong, take that plane to your better life!
hfwaxf,I'm glad you got out! That situation sounds like it would have just escolated over time. You're young and have much better things to do than try to fix someone who hurts you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
hfwaxf,have much better things to do than try to fix someone who hurts youWow, this is such a strong statement.
hfwaxf,Now his ex can deal with that baggage. You‚Äôll find someone more compatible for you when you‚Äôre ready- win/win
hfwaxf,I could see on her brothers Instagram a video of my ex smirking at his phone and the caption was ‚Äúhe‚Äôs thinking about my sister ;)‚Äù to which he replied with another winky face so‚Ä¶I'm sorry but this bit is really really weird, it seems like Ur ex surrounds himself with strange people who have very questionable emotional barriers.. really happy for u that you got out and all the best :)
hfwaxf,It is totally wierd right?? Who insinuates stuff like that about their sister? It was gross.
hfwaxf,~2k votes with 0 comments? That's unusual
hfwaxf,Was just thinking the same thing
hfwaxf,Topic was locked couple minutes ago ü§î
hfwaxf,The way she linked it was to a single comment. You can view all and there are more
hfwaxf,Here are the full comments, she linked a single commenthttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/grls25/im_unhappy_with_how_my_24_f_boyfriend_26m_treats/
hfwaxf,You are so brave. You reached out, you accepted the advice,  and you followed through. You my lady are no coward. You deserve a brave and honest person. Keep going and seek it.
hfwaxf,I‚Äôd suggest also doing some therapy as well, it can be really hard to untangle the emotional damage of an abusive relationship and if we don‚Äôt do that hello  for ourselves we may find ourselves in similar relationships or with similar types of people over and over.
hfwaxf,^This. It feels so good to get out, but that's when you realize exactly the depth of the damage. Have a professional who specializes in this help you work through it. Especially someone who knows personality disorders because I'd bet the farm he has one. I had the same exact convos with my BPD/NPD ex.
hfwaxf,You are brave! You are powerful! You are healing!You took a huge action‚Äîyou looked at your life and realized something had to change, you addressed your worries about making those moves, prepared yourself, and reset the whole motion of your life. The ball is rolling in a new direction, one that makes sure you're taking care of your own needs and giving yourself space to grow and be happy.Proud of ya.
hfwaxf,Hi, I went through something similar in my last relationship. Your comment about telling him to get help or he would end up a very lonely man really hit me hard, because that was one of the things I said as I was breaking up with my ex as well. I‚Äôm happy for you getting out of this relationship. You‚Äôre going to be so much happier and someday find someone who treats you right. Best of luck. :)
hfwaxf,Thank you! I'm glad you are doing better too :)
hfwaxf,Good for you. Watch out for ways that he will try to return to your life. Cut him off, no matter what he says. He will only hurt you more.Next, hold on to that ‚Äúcoming back to myself‚Äù feeling. It might be like your are resurfacing after being underwater. There will be lots of feelings and changes. Be gentle with yourself-it might be hard.Last, decide how to take what you learned forward. It‚Äôs going to come with you anyway, so you need to know that this will impact your relationships going forward.You‚Äôll be okay. Stay strong.
hfwaxf,That's a really good tip, after we have both moved out completely and the money side has been dealt with I will probably be blocking him on everything.
kcx4yw,Guy. You ate the last slice!? You'd better be glad she's not coming here for advice on what to do about you! Seriously though, glad things are going well for you
kcx4yw,I'll always be watching over my shoulder for the day she takes her revenge.
kcx4yw,Merciless stabbing, it's the only reasonable response. I am kidding you should never strewn your partner over pizza.  Also great update OP glad to hear you are happy.
kcx4yw,Good for you OP! I hope you‚Äôre happy and I‚Äôm glad everything worked out :)
kcx4yw,WAIT! They have reddit in heaven/hell?!
kcx4yw,My girl went from needing space time alone to deal with her anxiety/depression, to being with another dude. I respected her, gave her space and here I am. I really wish I can turn things around like you did. I'm happy for you.
kcx4yw,Look on the bright side, what if you were still with her and didnt know she could do this to you anyday. That is behind  you now my man, and the only way is forward. You WILL turn things around. I believe in you :))
kcx4yw,So glad you are happy :) congrats on the new relationship and the internship! Have a Merry Christmas and fantastic New Year!
kcx4yw,Merry Christmas and a Joyful New Year to you too laddie.
kcx4yw,Killin it on the career front was the best comeback you could have achieved. Way to go. It‚Äôs only up from here.
kcx4yw,I just want to take care of my family, my father has done everything for me while sacrificing a lot. I'd love to give back.
kcx4yw,‚ÄúLiving well is the best revenge‚Äù - George Herbert
kcx4yw,Words to live by
kcx4yw,One piece of advice, from a happily married guy, always leave the last piece of [X] for your girl. And let her know. Not as a manipulative ploy, but because it makes her happy. And it'll make you happy watching her eat it....plus you don't need the extra calories. If you're anything like me, you can the whole (pizza, box of cookies, entire cake/pie) by yourself. But it's better to share with your significant other.
kcx4yw,My now-husband has always done this, and it always stood out to me because no other guy has ever done that specifically. It‚Äôs small, but it really shows that he cares about me and wants to do little things for me. I always get the bigger slice, the last bite, etc. It sounds so small and minor but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always loved about him - even though I reaaaalllly don‚Äôt need the last slice of pizza lol
kcx4yw,My fianc√© and I do hello fresh meals and I get weird about dishes where protein may be split up unevenly (who has more shrimp etc) - it‚Äôs absurd and I‚Äôm aware but it‚Äôs not really changing.. last week he made meatballs and cut on in half because there was an uneven number so they‚Äôd be ‚Äúfair‚Äù - just the thought of it was amazing
hzwqcy,Nothing wrong in expressing gratitude. Express it in ways you can and in ways you know how. üòä
hzwqcy,"It's a sign of mediocrity when you demonstrate gratitude with moderation." - Roberto Benigni
hzwqcy,After reading through all of these great comments, I‚Äôm starting to realize that the problem lies within my inability to just... say thank you.  It‚Äôs so strange, I‚Äôve never realized I have a problem...
hzwqcy,It doesn't even have to be OP saying anything. OP can continue to be a kick ass barber.
hzwqcy,There's nothing more sincere then q hand written letter and a nice card. One that speaks to who you are and why your happy you met this guy. Everything you've written here sounds like gold. Best of luck friend!
hzwqcy,I'm hoping that eventually OP spend his own shop and names it after the guardian angel. Keep that good name alive.
hzwqcy,I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôm still relatively new, but it‚Äôs possible that the state barber board may recognize acts of generosity within the barbering community.  Barbering is 30% hair cutting and 70% general kindness so.... it‚Äôs possible!
hzwqcy,Or an award for working with young people / working with the community. A charity like the princes trust might be able to inform of such award makers.
hzwqcy,You could write a letter to him expressing everything you‚Äôve just described in this post. That‚Äôs usually what I do when I want to express my feelings to the people I love the most. I think letters are sincere and expressive because they usually contain a lot of thought.Writing a letter sounds clich√© or effortless, but I assure you, someone like your guardian angel, someone whose helped you for years and encouraged you while expecting nothing in return, would be deeply moved by how grateful you are, even if you express it through something as simple as a letter.(I saw writing a letter as a suggestion in the comments, but I wanted to express to you how much a letter could mean, especially if you pour your heart and soul out in it.)
hzwqcy,I think maybe I wrote what I wrote here, because I WANTED to write it to him, but just couldn‚Äôt for some reason... I just need to do it!
hzwqcy,This. I am awkward, shy, introverted and generally not good with emotions. With a letter you can get your point across without the in-person pressure. Plus, you can choose your words wisely and say all you need to say. This man wouldn‚Äôt have done all he did for you, if he didn‚Äôt care about you succeeding. You should tell him you you are grateful, if you‚Äôre feeling the pull to do so. I guarantee you this man will keep your letter for a long time.
hzwqcy,I was thinking of telling OP to just print out his post and give it the barber.
hzwqcy,Expressing gratitude is a skill like any other. You have had a pretty rough go of it until recently, so you probably haven't had much practice telling people in your life how much they mean to you. Don't feel self-conscious. Just show your mentor this post or write him a heart-to-heart letter. He will treasure your words, no matter how awkward you may think they are.
hzwqcy,I think you‚Äôre completely right.  for some reason reading this comment in particular really hit home... thank you <3
hzwqcy,This is such a wonderful post.  Thank you for sharing.  I was a high school teacher for many years.  The "gifts" from my former students that mean the most to me, that I still have and look at, are the letters in which they tell me I made a positive impact in their lives.  I cherish those letters.  So, as many others suggested here, I also suggest you write this man a heartfelt letter.  Be vulnerable and tell him exactly what's in your heart.  It will mean so much to him.  This man sounds like someone who was put on earth to do exactly what he did for you.  And he probably doesn't even need any thanks, it sounds like it is just who is...gracious and kind and loving...but telling him what you feel will be a wonderful gift to him and will help you on this journey you've undertaken to improve yourself.  Also, you might want to think about paying it forward...be open to another young man who needs a guardian angel.  Be that angel for someone else like this man was/is for you.  That would make him incredibly proud of you.
hzwqcy,I also wanted to share two quotes from Maya Angelou that I feel relate to this situation and may help you in expressing your thanks to your mentor:I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.When you learn, teach. When you get, give.
ne1neo,Your husband sounds lovely and still in love with you after so many years. Honestly, just saying "Hey I wanna have sex" works pretty dang well for my hubby and I who deals with very similar issues. No mind games, just love and honesty.
ne1neo,He's the best. I'm very lucky.Ya know, I legitimately never thought of just asking him. Last time I had any desire to initiate we were really young and it never crossed my mind. I honestly had no idea adults could have sex just by saying 'wanna have sex'. I thought it had to be much more subdued than that. Silly me. But I'm learning!
ne1neo,One day I was playing videogames and my wife sent me a calendar invite for "trip to pound town"."Sorry boys, got a meeting at 6 I forgot about"
ne1neo,I'll second this sentiment. When I want sex and she's not advertising the same, I'll do a little extra around the house, give her lots of little compliments, I'll sneak up and rub her feet and back...When she wants sex, she removes her clothes and lays down in the bed. A seven nation army couldn't hold me back. Don't over-think it!
ne1neo,Same. I have a couple of chronic pain conditions so hubby is totally OK with me saying no. He's also totally okay with me just telling him I'm horny, let's go.
ne1neo,Congratulations. Now remember that talking out your fears and differences is the only way to communicate in a marriage and will result in a much more loving and bonding marriage so don't stop.  Next time something bothers you like this, talk to your husband about it before it becomes an issue.  Your husband has already proven to you that he is willing to listen, compromise and help find a solution so it sounds like you have a wonderful partner that is willing to communicate.  Good luck and I'm glad it worked out.
ne1neo,We're actually usually very good at communication. We're almost always able to talk through our issues. I have some issues regarding sex tho, so it's a touchy subject for me. And I was just nervous to talk to him.
ne1neo,So many downers in life and this sub, reading something that put a smile on my face is incredibly uplifting.I can‚Äôt wish enough for your happy marriage  and increasingly better sex life
ne1neo,Thank you! Although, in all honesty, if my sex life gets any better I might explode. But still thank you!
ne1neo,My gf literally says, "mate?"On a serious note, glad you guys could talk it out. I was on medication that kinda killed my sex drive at first and would make it difficult to feel much sensation so I get it.EDIT: dunno if it's been mentioned but rejection is always tough, but it should also be something that both people are comfortable with. It isn't always something against the person rejected. Gotta think of it as your partner not being up for it, rather than something wrong with you.
ne1neo,Communication will resolve almost any issue.
ne1neo,We're actually normally really good about communicating. I just had a hang up about this specific topic I guess.
ne1neo,You know those spiders that have an extravagant mating dance? Just do that he will understand
ne1neo,Knowing him, he would know exactly what it meant. He has a vast expanse of just the weirdest pieces of information
ne1neo,Instructions unclear; she chewed off his head!
hqzk0u,This is one of those things that's like beautiful in a movie but IRL it's fucking weird. Like how do they expect you/"future girlfriend" would feel when reading this letter? It's really callous to me.I don't think you should contact her, it's your boyfriend's fault that she's even a factor in your relationship at all. He shouldn't be holding her on this pedestal because it's going to ruin any relationship he has with anyone else that's not her. I would tell him that her letter makes it feel like you will never be as close to him as she is/was and it doesn't make you feel good about the relationship because it seems like you're his second pick.
hqzk0u,My first reaction was this is some Love Actually style bs - supposedly cute and romantic but actually problematic and weird.
hqzk0u,I guess maybe the ex is just a genuinely nice person, but the "tips" to make him happy just felt weird.To OP, don't bother sending a reply out. If you're really uncomfortable, then tell your boyfriend how it made you feel. That you appreciate her being good to him, but would rather not have her cast a shadow on your current relationship.
hqzk0u,Yeah whenever I see exes say weird shit like, ‚Äúto the girl/boy who will love her/him one day...‚Äù it seems almost like claiming territory in a way. Not fully letting go or basically saying they are passing on the torch or approval or whatever it may be. It‚Äôs not appropriate and feels emotionally manipulative.
hqzk0u,It sounds exactly like this. The girl was 23 and didn‚Äôt really want the relationship to end, felt bad, so wrote these letters to make herself feel better.The boyfriend is too old to be passing it on to his new girlfriend. It‚Äôs been 3 years ffs.
hqzk0u,Agree, this letter while maybe well-intentioned is extremely rude. Even after breaking up, Golden Girl is butting into your relationship and trying to tell you how to be his gf. And your bf is allowing it!You can only be you, not her, and that‚Äôs what you should focus on. Don‚Äôt try to be anyone else! If that‚Äôs not good enough for Mr. Never Love Like That Again, it‚Äôs best if he learns to deal with your non-Goldenness early.
hqzk0u,Right!! Sweet, kind of... I guess? The fact her bf actually gave her the letter over 9mo later is strange imo. Should‚Äôve skimmed it and tossed it,  plus what if there was something nasty written, as if telling her how to be a girlfriend isn‚Äôt bad enough.
hqzk0u,Yes! Seems like a weird thing you would do  in a movie before dying of a sudden disease.
hqzk0u,I would tell him that her letter makes it feel like you will never be as close to him as she is/was and it doesn't make you feel good about the relationship because it seems like you're his second pick.This seems unnecessarily provocative and aggressive.  Don't do this, OP.  Yes, be open and honest, but in a constructive way.  Starting off by saying how you feel like "his second pick" creates unnecessary conflict.
hqzk0u,He shouldn't be holding her on this pedestal because it's going to ruin any relationship he has with anyone else that's not herExactly. And the worst part is that as time goes on, his memory of her will be this built up thing he vaguely remembers.. when they might not even have been together this long regardless.
hqzk0u,Yeah it‚Äôs weird and honestly really cringe worthy.  Boyfriend should have just left the letter unopened or read it himself, it‚Äôs odd he gave it to OP and suggests he harbors quite strong feelings still
hqzk0u,Did the ex think he wouldn‚Äôt change from the age of 23 for the rest of his life? They were only together three years, it‚Äôs just not that deep. I‚Äôd honestly toss the letter and forget it existed. If this relationship is going to last, it‚Äôs going to have nothing to do with what she wrote in the letter, or the tips she gave you to make him happy.
hqzk0u,To me its weird to have the tips in there. Like I get it, they had a great relationship that ended, but this is your relationship. Those tips might not be you and now they might rattle around in your brain.I would personally hand the letter back to your bf, tell him that she seems like a nice person, but you want to make a boundary that you are not interested in her being a part of your relationship with him. That you need to make sure he is on board with you 100% and not just because you are a second choice.And he should hear you out and support you. This is an important moment where he needs to make sure that his past relationship isn't overshadowing the current one, and sadly just from comments its starting to here and there. He should never have given you the letter. It was a selfishness of her part to do that honestly. She's not dead, she's far away, but if she ever wants to come back now you have to worry and consider if he wouldn't up and leave you for her.9 months is long enough to know how things are going, and where things are at. You can't compete with a "saint", so you shouldn't bother. Be you, be the best you you can be, because that is what you should do. Don't try to be her, or be the relationship he had. You and your bf have your own relationship that needs to grow and become stronger.
hqzk0u,I think the reason the letter seems weird is because it suggests continued 'ownership'.... almost like she's loaning him out or gifting him to the next person. 'Tips' to make him happy?It's weird and patronising and condescending, and no wonder it doesn't sit right with OP.  It would amke anyone feel insecure and like the third wheel in a relationship, as if they didn't belong. Don't think it's appropriate at all.
hqzk0u,Completely agree with all of this!!Especially this part!!tell him that she seems like a nice person, but you want to make a boundary that you are not interested in her being a part of your relationship with him. That you need to make sure he is on board with you 100% and not just because you are a second choice.As for my opinion, I think the letter is super weird. I don't think it's appropriate for the friends to tell you they were "THE dream couple" and "that they think he's never going to love again like he loved her." Those aren't the kinds of things you say to your friend's current partner.Talk to your boyfriend and be honest with your feelings about the letter and be honest with how you feel about what his friends have said. I hope they haven't continued to say these things to you.
hqzk0u,I agree about the tips. That has the stink of "I know him better than you do". The whole letter is just one big reminder that she came first, and I don't think it's unintentional.
lq5de8,My college roommate did the same thing with a full ride for grad school‚Äîstar crossed reconnection with a hometown guy and everything!! Surprise, didn‚Äôt work out either.
lq5de8,I did the exact opposite - I accepted a great job at a prestigious national lab because my boyfriend of 4+ years worked there. We dated for two more years and then broke up. I used the papers I wrote there to propel me into a well respected PhD program working for the top guy in my field who remains my mentor today....said no one ever.....
lq5de8,I feel like "don't give up a full ride scholarship for a relationship x should be a life pro tip after reading this.
lq5de8,This hurts me deep in my soul. It took two application cycles and more than $500 in application fees to land ONE full-ride grad school offer. And I worked for it--boned up on my language skills, got a MA to make me a more viable candidate.To throw away something so many people work so hard for just to gamble on a dude? I just can't.
lq5de8,Wow, if only someone could have seen this coming
lq5de8,I am truly shocked. Just unbelievable.
lq5de8,Im glad it all worked for her, but that last comment made me laugh too hard. No kidding turning down a full scholarship for a boyfriend isn‚Äôt the smartest move.
lq5de8,I was against it the whole time! I was worried I‚Äôd lose her friendship over it, but she respected my honesty.
lq5de8,Which is honestly why i advocate for dating in your highschool/middleschool years to get burned as the consequences aren't as harsh and lessons can be learned.But overall 30k for a life lesson isn't too bad as some might lose their jobs/friend circles/assets in unhappy marriages later in life (where its harder to get back) to learn these lessons.
lq5de8,Did her mom ever admit it was a mistake to pour romantic comedy nonsense into her daughter‚Äôs head?Edit: grammar
lq5de8,I‚Äôm still not her mom‚Äôs biggest fan...no. She‚Äôs all into the romantic comedy nonsense with my friend‚Äôs new relationship, too. But my friend has stronger boundaries now and throws most of her mom‚Äôs advice out the window.
lq5de8,Everyone in the last post was right - unfortunately you gotta let people make their own mistakes; it's the only way they learn.
lq5de8,That sucks though. Isn't that why we are taught things, so that we don't make those mistakes? Why should people have to suffer just to "learn a lesson"?
lq5de8,Whew I can relate to your friend, I almost did this TWICE! Once for a boy I was dating my freshman year of college, and then once for a man I was engaged to during the first semester of my PhD. I did not follow through with EITHER and I am very glad because neither relationship ended up working out and I would have, like your friend, been lonely and in more debt! I'm glad her life worked out in the end, but that is quite the lesson to learn!
lq5de8,Glad it worked out, still makes me wince to think about how she'd basically have 30k free if it wasn't for that one guy. Most expensive 1 year relationship ever. :/
lq5de8,$30k+ is a lot for a lesson but at least it was worth it.
lq5de8,I‚Äôm shocked! /sThanks for the update, glad she learned her lesson.
lq5de8,I think some people just go through life not really learning the underlying lesson that connects all the drama in their lives.I had a friend at school who would "fall in love" over and over. Always with some nightmarishly unsuitable guy. One was writing her from prison, she was mid teens and he was in his 30s. One she met online in the early days of the internet, she actually married him days after she was legally old enough to marry.We lost touch not long after that, every time I'd hear from her it's the same. I'm in love with my biology professor. He's 68. I'm 20. We are going to elope. I'm in love with the server at pizza hut. I'm in love with my dad's best friend. Every time it was like NO GUYS I MEAN IT THIS IS THE ONE.We are all older now and nothing has changed. Her current husband doesn't work just stays home all day gaming. But, you guessed it, she loves him so...
m3l3uh,Jesus.I am so sorry about this but I am glad you were able to get away safely.I don't want to alarm you but if he is still harrassing you, then you need to be concerned.I recommend you let your family and friends know what is going on. Preserve any messages from him that he sends (even from different numbers). And consider if you want to pursue a restraining order.This is not just a bad breakup. This is harrassment.
m3l3uh,If I were op I would be a little bit nervous about the potential for physical stalking. In addition to preserving previous evidence, I would start using a security camera at my place and while I wouldn't agonize over the footage, I would save it just in case.
m3l3uh,Damn. Consider a restraining order or something. His obsessive behavior is concerning and it‚Äôs better safe than sorry.
m3l3uh,this actually could be an option, OP even if he doesn‚Äôt seem threatening now please keep a record of every uncomfortable text, call, post, etc. just in case :< i‚Äôve had to deal with a crazy obsessive ex before and it was a very tough experience
m3l3uh,it IS a realistic option. she should do it.
m3l3uh,This should be top. Guy is way too obsessed.
m3l3uh,OP please do this. This guy is nuts, like... Nuts nuts.
m3l3uh,In my experience you need direct evidence with intent to harm before you'll be granted a RO.
m3l3uh,Yes yes yes 100%. My brain is ringing full of red flaga. Be safe!
m3l3uh,This dude is nuts. Leave and don't ever look back.. seriously...
m3l3uh,Yeah this dude is batshit, good riddance OP seriously.  Offering to LOAN you to your ex so he can 'recreate' old times wtf UGH
m3l3uh,Seriously her and her ex broke up for reasons andthe now-ex still decides it's  a good idea to be the bigger idiot. What the hell was he thinking was gonna happen ...
m3l3uh,Definitely time to get a restraining order if he keeps getting new phone numbers to call OP from. Psycho much? Wow. Glad OP left them.
m3l3uh,I second this comment
m3l3uh,Seriously sounds like he had a mental break down...
m3l3uh,Maybe look back just to make sure he's not following you...
m3l3uh,He sounds deeply insecure and like he was trying to portray himself as some sort of big shot because he has you now and not your ex.... which is weird. It sounds like he was using you almost like a trophy, and constantly trying to compete with ex. I‚Äôm glad you got rid of him, sometimes situations like that can turn dangerous in seconds.
m3l3uh,I agree, he was deeply insecure on crazy levels
o4c6y1,You are one heck of a mum and an even better person. Ben and Jason are lucky to have you üëè
o4c6y1,Really heartwarming to see that there are still good people in this world.
o4c6y1,Jason seems like a great kid too
o4c6y1,Bob may not have chosen you to be his partner, but Ben chose you to be his mom. That‚Äôs a testament not only to what a shitty human your ex is, but what a wonderful person you must be for that child who has lost everyone to have chosen you. I hope things get better soon for you and your boys
o4c6y1,As someone who is a step-mom to 3 awesome boys, this brought tears to my eyes.OP, this is so true. The fact that Ben chose you is so amazing and says so much about how wonderful you are.
o4c6y1,Shoutout to Jason here too. I knew guys like him popular, athletic, had it easy socially and always stood up for others who didn‚Äôt for various reasons. Class act.
o4c6y1,This is not a mopey post, this is a beautiful post. You are an amazing woman and those boys are lucky to have you and so will your true love when you meet him.
o4c6y1,This is a huge win for her and the kids, at the cost of an already broken relationship.No losses here honestly./u/Unique-Emergency3407 , I urge you to undergo the paperwork of getting any resemblance of custody of Ben as soon as possible. Things might seem fine now, but you wouldn't want any further implications with Bob.
o4c6y1,Exactly! This was nothing but life/the universe/God giving OP another son and a valuable lesson. Nothing lost here.
o4c6y1,I‚Äôm so sorry for the mess of feelings you must be experiencing right now.   The hurt of being betrayed, the confusion of how Bob used and manipulated you when you believed you finally found a great man after so long, yet the love and relief you have for Ben being safe.I imagine the hardest part right now is the fear of your own judgement and trust in your thoughts and feelings since Bob was such a liar.  You raised Jason to be a fantastic son, brother, and human being ‚Äî evidenced by his strength, empathy, and compassion to you, Ben, and your family unit.You didn‚Äôt make a mistake.  Not a single one.  You are an incredible, smart, successful person.  I know that and you should know that because of how this has turned out.  Because of how Jason turned out.  Because of how Ben is able to and wants to stay with you.   Because the three of you are fine and you are able to take care of two teenage boys and get proper legal advice.  You achieved all of that while most people would not be able to.Bob is a loser.  He‚Äôs a user and a liar.  He took advantage of your kindness and heart and he‚Äôs scum you were smart enough to reject before you even found out about the cheating and his ulterior motives!   Please focus on this!  You rejected him!!Yes, he made you believe lies. But your strengths and qualities let you discover them and make the right choices before you even knew the full extent.  Your awesomeness is also letting you recover and move on with two good young men who love and care about you.I hope you don‚Äôt give up on finding romantic love for yourself with a wonderful man because I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs out there just wishing to have someone like you for his family.  Don‚Äôt let Bob have that influence or impact on you.  You are incredible and Bob was nothing more than an instrument to find Ben the adopted family he deserves.Who knows, Ben might be the reason you find real love with a really good man! The way Jason accidentally led to Ben being in your life, we never know.   Just keep being you and being a wonderful mom and person.  Stay strong and be proud of yourself!
o4c6y1,I love every word of this post!
o4c6y1,Well, as it turns out, all of you can do better than Bob the shitbird.Be thankful you will not be tied to him, because really, he‚Äôs going to drop the responsibility of Ben in your lap and fuck right off. Your attorney is going to fight for you, your kids, and Ben. And that‚Äôs all that matters. Bob is a giant nothingburger. Treat him as such.
o4c6y1,Bob is a giant nothingburger.Never a truer word spoken (apart from Bob the Shitbird - that comes joint first).
o4c6y1,It might be good for Ben to see a therapist if he isn't already. He's had a lot happen in the last 4 years. It doesn't hurt to have somewhere he can safely talk to someone who is an objective advocate.
o4c6y1,Agree, but will add that family therapy (counseling) for and among all three would be extremely helpful in guiding a healthy new family structure. It would be normal for OPs biological son to have some jealousy issues no matter how much he sees Ben as a brother.
o4c6y1,Also, it might come in handy if there's ever a legal battle.
o4c6y1,So glad that Ben gets to stay with you! You are amazing for being in his life and dedicating yourself to being there for him; for being someone who actually cares for him as his own person (not just as an extension of themselves, like Bob did).You are so strong, and I know that it hurts now but time and self care will help. Just know that even though your emotions may feel confusing right now, it's okay to know that you wanted the relationship to end but still grieve it at the same time. You're grieving the loss of love that you had for him before, and that's okay even if the love wasn't there at the end.Accept your feelings as they are, don't judge yourself for any of it because you're not at fault for any of this and you're doing the best you can, and let yourself grieve and heal and move on in your own way, with your sons by your side. üíì
o4c6y1,I am not pleased with Bob but I am glad Ben is safe and that the boys are happy!You heal, being lied to hurts, it doesn't matter if you were through with Bob or not, it hurts and there's nothing to be ashamed about.You are bound for someone wonderful and I know the kids will be absolutely thrilled for you!!
o4c6y1,I‚Äôm really grateful that Ben and Jason have a great mom like you. Thanks for being a good person.
o4c6y1,That putz was nothing but a mere instrument so OP and Ben could meet. Life/ GOD/ karma/ the universe/ whatever you believe in, works in mysterious ways and orchestrated all these events.Bob accomplished the purpose he was he put in OP's life for and now he's disposable, nothing but trash and this is how OP needs to look at him and move on.Her reward is around the corner and will happen when she least expects it because that's how it works.
o4c6y1,Holy Hera what a twist. I'm so glad Ben is able to stay with you and you can give him a safe and loving home. I'm sorry Bob turned out to be such a terrible person, though <3
lrcym1,Gosh...I never saw the first post at the time but her email was savage...I‚Äôm so sorry Op, that was one of the unkindest, most malicious things I‚Äôve ever read. Wow.
lrcym1,I only read this email for the first time and it made my heart sink, as if it was directed to me. Such a shitty thing to send to someone.
lrcym1,When I got to the point where she said "interpersonal relationship skills are SO much more important than being smart" I knew immediately that she showed her hand. That's the kind of sentence you hear from someone who feels like their life hasn't amounted to anything and is jealous of the people they think have done more important things in their life. Any non-jealous person would say that both interpersonal skills and intelligence are important. The way she phrased that, it's so obvious how she felt. It reminded me of similar words spoken by my own older sister.
lrcym1,Yeah, I was squirming the whole time I read it.
lrcym1,Absolutely. I cannot fathom being so cruel to another person, especially my own sibling. My stomach is in knots from reading it. I'm glad she's out of OP's life.
lrcym1,I just read it for the first time. It was absolutely insane.
lrcym1,and you know its all a big lie bc OP kept getting called back, almost every day.
lrcym1,Would love to know what‚Äôs happened in 5 years. Did you overcome your depression? Did you continue teaching or working in law?
lrcym1,My reply was blocked for a while while waiting for mods to unlock this thread. Thanks for asking!I continued subbing for about a year or so after that post. I continued to seek professional feedback and got to a point where I no longer had any doubts about my quality of work or professionalism. In my time subbing, I was able to work at over 40 different schools, in about a dozen different districts. I got 'preferred' sub status at a couple of the schools, and a few long-term offers for classes whose teachers left midway through the school year. Any professionalism concerns I originally had have since been put to rest, as far as I'm concerned.That all said: substitute teaching is a pretty crappy job, on multiple levels. It doesn't even qualify as a public service job for public service student loan forgiveness.Since then I've passed my state bar exam, became a licensed attorney, started my own law practice, and it's been growing. I'm earning more and my quality of life has improved. I'm a long ways away from the worst of my depression, but lifestyle changes and talk therapy helped me reach a point where I am able to function and manage, without meds.There have been difficulties along the way, but I'm in a better space now than I was five years ago.
lrcym1,I'd also like to know. Glad that you're better anyway!
lrcym1,I second that! Cutting out your sister was an admirable move for sure, but were you able to go back to teaching?
lrcym1,I just read the original email and my heart hurts. Anyone who says ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt have a mean bone in their body‚Äù is a total jerk and so is the person they‚Äôre referring to, but wow did it ever get worse than that. That email is so out of line and hateful over second hand GOSSIP reported over happy hour. Probably mostly exaggerated and made up. I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre happy and you cut that person out. She is NOT your friend and certainly not someone you should devote even a moments thought.I‚Äôm adopted, so the whole ‚Äúblood‚Äù thing has never had an impact on me. I love my family dearly because they‚Äôre incredible, loving, kind people. They are my family not because theyre in my bloodline, but because we treat eachother with love and respect. Don‚Äôt ever feel guilty for walking away from blood. You deserve to be loved and happy. There was nothing loving about that horrible message.
lrcym1,Yeah the whole all the teachers read his notes & laugh would indicate they are all mean & have several mean bones in their body! It also seemed like somone was jealous that they were intelligent, creative & could see better ways of doing something, especially when they didn't have the same qualifications as them. Anyone who thinks a qualification automatically means they are right has a huge ego & usually a low IQ. I'm glad OP didn't believe this obviously false, hurtful, allocations & was able to move on to better things.
lrcym1,Did you ever get any feedback from the school you were subbing at? If they had you every day it seems like they actually liked you! Did you stay in town, or move back to the other state to be a lawyer? Would love more life updates.Good for you for cutting out your sister. That letter was just dripping with animosity.Edit: typo
lrcym1,I'm curious too. The list of "problems" with OP was extensive. I want to know how long it took for "Jenny" and sister to make it, how they even came to some of those conclusions. Jesus. They were so specific and so targeted. Poor op.
lrcym1,Hey just want to make sure you saw OPs reply here, as it answers your questions!
lrcym1,I‚Äôm sorry, how is this a 5 year update, something doesn‚Äôt make sense here.  In the original post, OP was 35, and in this post, they are 44...something is fishy
mouqno,I was dating a guy with a nightmare best friend. I thought she was into him. But I think she was just in the "girlfriend space" for so long because he had been single so long, that she was having a hard time adjusting to a new person in his life. He also had horrible boundaries. We ended up fighting pretty bad, and I said some mean things that were personal and went beyond what she did. She took the high road and apologized which shocked me. I'd never had someone admit they'd done wrong before. I apologized as well and we actually got close after that. Maybe it's a similar situation for you and will end up better in the long run I hope. Either way. That's good that your partner has your back. Regardless of her intentions or feelings, it's her behavior that is out of line.
mouqno,I‚Äôm so afraid of this happening with my guy best friend when he gets a girlfriend. I know exactly how it feels to be in that place where bf doesn‚Äôt take your side and it honestly makes one feel crazy. I want his future gfs to feel comfortable and honestly like me but I would follow all boundaries with no complaint for her comfort and peace of mind. His last fling that he had ended because he never told her about me and when she randomly messaged me asking for all this information I didn‚Äôt lie to her and I guess she lost feelings for him?? (Rightfully so I mean he was being a douchebag and lied about me) and I wasn‚Äôt going to lie ! Ugh.
mouqno,This sounds like a man who is prioritizing your feelings and your relationship. Quality boyfriend material üëå
mouqno,Even though he doesn‚Äôt share her opinion, he still prioritized her feelings. High quality bf for sure!!
mouqno,Quality boyfriend material üëå/So rare sentence to read on reddit
mouqno,I know, I was pleasantly surprised by his texts. No gf blaming, just straight up calling his friend out. That is a good guy.
mouqno,Rare piece,OP best of luck
mouqno,High quality boyfriend? He should have known all that before his gf told him. I'm not trying to say that he's stupid, but he's definitely lower IQ if he clearly doesn't notice when a girl is a trying to flirt with him in front of his girlfriend. From my point of view he's kind of person who's easily being manipulated.
mouqno,This reminds me so much of that tik tok user who has the ‚ú®chill girl‚ú®series.
mouqno,Oh, I think it's @ kisserkel on TikTok. She has that SPOT ON series about Amber, Jason, and the Chill Girl. The comments section on her videos is fascinating to me because it's about 95% women reporting that they've had to deal with a Chill Girl encroaching on their relationship and 5% women defending Chill Girl.
mouqno,Lmao what is this exactly plz share
mouqno,Exactly this!!! OMG. The replies of the friend on the original thread is the exact vibe of the ‚Äúchill/cool girl‚Äù stereotype. Those tiktoks make me cringe because they‚Äôre so accurate.Just a side note to the OP, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that she was into him. It‚Äôs that she was being territorial of her ‚Äúbest guy friend‚Äù and wants you to know through her indirect actions that she knows him sooo well and they are so close and she‚Äôs the #1 girl in his life. Calling him pet names in front of you and telling you not to be intimidated by their closeness is her trying to put you in your place. Classic insecure, immature 20-something girl behaviour, and tbh it probably has nothing to do with him and everything to do with how she sees other pretty females in her space. You feel like ‚Äúyou won‚Äù because she‚Äôs subtly competing with you. But see it for what it is and feel bad for her rather than letting it bring down your energy.
mouqno,I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt use that as an opportunity to confess to him, but she probably realized it wouldn‚Äôt go well at that point. Good for you OP, and I‚Äôm glad it worked out.
mouqno,No, but she‚Äôll use it as an opportunity to accuse her of being ‚Äúinsecure‚Äù and try to split them up down the road. This girl wants him to be available at all times. This is not going to be an easy ride.
mouqno,Or maybe they really are just friends and OP is insecure and is looking at things through jealous colored glasses.
hrddje,Uhhh ‚ÄúLast hurrah‚Äù? What a odd and suspicious thing to say as a reason. A last hurrah before moving is a weekend with his girlfriend not sleeping with some random person..? Yeah, I highly doubt it was one time especially because of this statement
hrddje,Right? When he said it was a ‚Äúlast hurrah‚Äù to close off his chapter in his state before he moved to where I‚Äôm from, makes no sense to me, what was the purpose of it. And then tries to back it up by saying it was only something physical and there was nothing emotional about it LOL
hrddje,anyone that treats exclusivity in a relationship as some sort of prison shouldn't be in a monogamous relationship or possibly any relationship until they figure their shit out and decide if a fucking randos or a good person by your side is more important.
hrddje,My ex told me this horseshit... that‚Äôs exactly what it was. HORSE. SHIT.
hrddje,I hate that "last hurrah" BS that people use for weddings and stuff too. You shouldn't be marrying someone who kills your hurrahs.
hrddje,Jesus fucking christ, the last thing i did as a ‚Äúlast hurrah‚Äù was voluntarily commit myself for a few days.
hrddje,Wow, the level he went to trying to defend his cheating is vile. I'm glad it's over and you can move on and find someone better (honestly that bar ain't high though).
hrddje,I'm honestly surprised he told her about the herpes and to get tested. Probably the one thing he handled correctly.
hrddje,Absolutely dodged a bullet there. Breaking up sucks, but he sounds like a horrible dude and testament to you for being so strong.It might be a good time to get tested for other STIs, for peace of mind. Whilst herpes tests don‚Äôt normally work unless you‚Äôre having a flare up, I would go get checked for other infections so you can have a completely fresh start away from that pile of crap.
hrddje,Ironically I had a check up about maybe 2 weeks ago from my gynecologist and I got tested for other stuff and I‚Äôm clean. I think for herpes, you have to specifically ask for that test so I have to make an appointment sometime this week
hrddje,I'm petty, but I would straight be finding one of their social media posts and telling her that she might wanna get tested since her "bae" just let you, his girlfriend, know he has an STI.The nerve of these people cheating then wanting to be friends, like you have no standards.
hrddje,haha I love drama and this would be amazing
hrddje,Please, oh please, oh PLEASE, do this.
hrddje,Nah it's not her responsibility. Maybe private messaging the girl not to further embarrass the parties involved.
hrddje,lmfao what a fucking dumbass. glad you ditched that clown OP. I see many STDs in his future
hrddje,Guuuuurl...I had a huge crush on my best guy friend who I had known since I was 14 years old. We were best friends and talked all the time. He moved away to go to college and we still talked and were super close all those years. We met in middle school when we were babies, around 2004 or so. When we started dating when I was 25, it felt amazing. I was literally dating the guy I had the biggest crush on since I was a teenager. We had such a whirlwind romance. He was sweet to me, he bought me flowers, he treated me like gold, and I moved to NYC with him for a long time and we lived that New York life and completely had it made.Then...I had to use my laptop for something, but mine was having a huge update going on, so I just used his laptop (something I've never done before) and his email was open and there were DOZENS of emails where he was chatting with other MEN and I saw dozens of emails of him and other dudes setting up meet-up times to sleep together.I confronted him for sleeping with dozens of men while in a relationship with me and he didn't even deny it."It was just physical, it didn't mean anything! I love you! You're so important to me and I love you so much. Those men meant nothing to me, I'm not even gay. I'm completely 100% heterosexual."Was literally what he said. Also, I have nothing against gay people at all. My ex was a cheating scumbag -- it just so happened that the people he cheated on me with were randoms from the internet that he'd have one night stands with. People who use the whole: "It was just physical, it didn't mean anything" excuse are vile pieces of garbage.I luckily didn't have STDs and checked myself for everything after this incident. To this day, I'm still mad about this breakup and it's been half a decade already. Will likely hold a grudge until the end of time over this one.
hrddje,Yeah, the whole "it didn't mean anything" line always kills me. If it didn't mean anything but doing it was more important than your relationship, what does the relationship mean to you? Uck.
hrddje,Gurl, I‚Äôm shook just reading all of this. I‚Äôm so sorry you had to find out that way but that‚Äôs literally crazy!
jngvrf,I sound like a cocky asshole but god does it feel good to remember you‚Äôre not as worthless as someone made you feel.Not even a little bit. I'm so happy for you! Also, you should be proud of yourself.
jngvrf,I agree with this so much, and OP said it so perfectly too. You ARE amazing and strong and empathetic and kind and loving and honest, u/Intelligent_Ad3412. And now you‚Äôre happier and confident, too. That likely shines through when you talk to people and only enhances what I can pretty much guarantee is your natural beauty. Of course you‚Äôre killing it. Of course you‚Äôre getting numbers and dates. You freaking rock, my friend, and you got this. Even though I don‚Äôt know you personally, I‚Äôm very proud of you.
jngvrf,I remember that feeling and it was terrifying and liberating at the same time!  Every so often I would remember how scared I was of being alone and how I believed that I could never fend for myself and be proud of who I had become.
jngvrf,You‚Äôre not being cocky!!! It‚Äôs great to hear your good news!!! Get out and enjoy yourself!!!
jngvrf,I laughed at that part. OP does not sound like a cocky asshole.
jngvrf,Wow, sounds like you got out of a terrible situation. I wonder how much of his parents coldness towards you was because of stories he was making up about you to get sympathy or money out of them.Enjoy your new life!
jngvrf,I wonder that too but honestly I don‚Äôt even care haha I have new and better things to move onto! Thank you :)
jngvrf,Congratulations on getting out of a crap relationship! Best of luck in your future, OP :)
jngvrf,I remember this story, I‚Äôm glad you broke up with him, you deserve better.
jngvrf,Thank you. It‚Äôs hard right now but I feel better every day :)
jngvrf,I‚Äôm so happy for you - enjoy living your new life!
jngvrf,I also have an ex that would lie about any- and everything. If he were to say the sky was blue, I'd have to check for myself, because that day it would have been green. Meaningless, unimportant, and easily verifiable stuff too. It finally got to the point that I didn't believe a word he said, and you just can't build a meaningful relationship with someone like that
jngvrf,It's crazy how many people like this there are out there. I dated a guy for a while and he was so good at lying I had no idea, and I like to think of myself as a pretty smart person.  He told people he owned his own  lawn care business, told me stories about things that happened that I later found out were from shows and YouTube videos, lied about his relationships with his family and his past relationships. The one that really got me is he lied about his best friend dying from an OD in high school. He would literally keep me up some nights consoling him about losing his friend. There were even movies he wouldn't watch because it reminded him of his friend. The friend never existed. Once we got to the point where if I didn't see it or hear it I didn't believe it, I knew I had to leave.
jngvrf,My ex was a narcissist who gaslit me, and made jokes at my expense for shits and giggles. Ended up with a house, 2 cats and a dog, but oh god was it the best decision to end that relationship. I hope you are in a better place like OP. Edit cause English.
jngvrf,Looking back I‚Äôm dying laughing at myself calling them ‚Äúwhite lies‚Äù like guuuurl what?? But happy I got out sooner rather than later. Thank you!
jngvrf,Ah man lifting that dead weight off feels so great!! Glad you got out while you did. I wish you all the luck making that new place a home.
jngvrf,You do not sound like a cocky asshole. You sound like someone who recognizes and values your own self worth. Keep going.
jngvrf,Wait, your post is from 2mos ago, but you say you've waited 4mos for him to go therapy?
jngvrf,It says 90 days ago for me, and that would be 3 months but if she means 4 months like she gave him from August to October and counted November even though it just started it would be true.
jngvrf,It happened in July and I waited a while to post. I waited from the beginning of July til now (end of oct) so that‚Äôs about 4 months :)
jngvrf,See, a white lie would be telling you he loved a particular dish you made him, and never having the heart to come clean when you kept making it for him.What this guy did was lie repeatedly about important financial matters, and kept doing so after you got serious.He just wasn't a trustworthy person.  It sounds like he wants to be more successful and independent than he really is, but that doesn't excuse the lying.That being said - I have a lot more respect for people who choose to live with family to save money.  Same thing with family plans on things like phones, car insurance, etc- the arrangement can work great for everyone, it doesn't always mean they're mooching off of their parents.
nqhc9l,You made the right decision, you can't compete with a ghost
nqhc9l,And that's really it. She's made an idealized form of her ex to help her grieve, but she isn't letting go. I feel bad for both of them. OP wanted to make her happy and have a relationship, but she was still not in a place to have one. The healing process is hard and clearly she needs a push. Hopefully, she gets the therapy she needs and doesn't keep relying on ghost boyfriend.Also, congrats OP!
nqhc9l,So true, and I am sure (ex) gf idealized the dead boyfriend, so that the dead guy had no flaws and was perfect.  Had the dude lived, the flawed human would exist to be compared against.
nqhc9l,This is the main reason I will never date again.  It‚Äôs unfair to the other person. My husband was absolutely perfect for me in every way.  There never was, is, or will be anyone who comes close to him in my eyes.  To subject someone to a lifetime of being Number 2 is cruel.I‚Äôll die alone.
nqhc9l,The ghost with the most, apparently.
nqhc9l,100%I made a comment on another post with a similar problem and I got absolutely skewered for saying it.
nqhc9l,I think the advice given to OP was, predictably, very rash and too quick to say this is irreconcilable.How about advice to at least suggest that OP's girlfriend go to counseling? Why does almost every top comment on this sub always immediately tell people to break up?As always, I am left to think that the people on this sub don't have a good sense for people here being real people who can actually mature and make meaningful changes in their lives if they are prompted to do so.
nqhc9l,I agree that the gf's ex being a constant presence must have been hurtful to deal with; especially on the day he deserved to have his partner share in the joy of his achievements.It sounds as if his (ex) gf is resentful. Without more info than he shares which is that she's actually a wonderful person and a lot of the problems were actually his fault, I think it's wrong for everyone to pile on in this situation. In relationships, communication is vital, and he says he has been lacking in communication skills. From my own experience, being with someone who refuses to improve their communication skills despite repeated efforts to talk about it can cause so much pain, hurt, and eventually resentment, that I too have eventually left - after things came to a head like they did here. My partner knew when it was all said and done that I had been repeatedly clear that his refusal to get help for his problems communicating with me in a way that allowed us to develop trust and growth would end up in my great unhappiness and likely end to the relationship, and he still resisted.If he is able to take what he has learned and decides to truly work on his communication skills, better relationships will be his reward. I'm thrilled to see him reflecting and taking responsibility. Well done OP! I wish you all the best going forward. You've got this.
nqhc9l,You absolutely did the right thing OP, here is to a new start ü•Ç
nqhc9l,Sounds like you did the right thing. My partner also has a deceased ex, and I certainly would struggle of he was comparing me to her constantly. Grief is odd, but boundaries need to be maintained.Wishing you the best.
nqhc9l,Yea, I'm the widow in my relationship, and while I definitely do talk about my late husband quite a bit, it is never done a in a comparison way.   I would NEVER say to my boyfriend 'husband was like this, why aren't you?'. And because I am respectful of that, he is respectful of the fact that my husband will always be a part of my life, and we can talk and I can tell stories, etc.
nqhc9l,I'm the one with a deceased ex in my relationship, and reading the original post was appalling to me. My wife is her own person, not a replacement. I would be lying if I tried saying I've never had intrusive thoughts comparing them, but they're intrusive thoughts, not something to bring up unless explicitly asked (and there are a few subjects I would refuse or be reluctant to comment on). My wife understands that I'll always hold the grief, but we have our own relationship that developed on its own
nqhc9l,I know it's hard but you absolutely did the right thing.   I remember your original post and was so frustrated at your ex's behaviour.It's going to be hard and sad now but you will be so happy soon.  Take the time to breathe freely and enjoy being on your own.
nqhc9l,For real, I just read the post and was beyond annoyed with the girlfriend. Her boyfriend died and was turned into a Saint with no flaws. That would be crushing everything you did something wrong or right to be told well Timmy never messed up or always did X.
nqhc9l,Two years is better than twenty, man.Breathe, take it one day at a time, and you'll come out ahead from this. Trust me.Also: she doesn't have to be a bad person to be in the wrong here. Don't beat yourself up thinking she's blameless.
nqhc9l,Some relationships can only blossom so far.You enjoyed this relationship as much as possible, then let go when it became more depleting than nurturing.When you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold on to.*Taoist proverb
lqdjmb,That's a great update OP, thanks! Glad you made a new friend!
lqdjmb,Lol I love this post cause it pretty much explains all problems with dogs it‚Äôs mostly the owner and not the dog itself
lqdjmb,This very thing happens with kids, too.This realization hit me the hardest when my boyfriend moved into my ex-husband's home (we each have our daughter 50% of the time, week on/week off) for a few months (covid hit both of them hard and we all have a good relationship). Seeing who she is while there, almost seemed like she was a totally different person and definitely someone else's kid! He's a softie that gives in and I am not.Reading this post immediately reminded me of that scenario, almost identical with the begging and whining lol.
lqdjmb,TBF, this is usually the issue with bad behavior. Be it in dogs or kids or any other animal. If the caretakers allow it to happen, it will continue.
lqdjmb,Yeah, just watch any episode of It's me or the dog and you'll see its clearly ALWAYS the owners fault when dogs misbehave, its quite sad. But damn if it isn't satisfying to see the owners realise how terrible they are.
lqdjmb,This sooo much.A friend's family has this small, annoying dog. He constantly demands attention and barks incessantly.Once, we decided to just ignore him, and he shut up and became quiet. Then the mother showed up and immediatelly got the dog excited again. It was frustrating to see.
lqdjmb,Easy solution: keep the awesome dog and lose the bad roommate.
lqdjmb,Bruh came here to say this.
lqdjmb,Hey now!  Some of us raise our dogs right.Sometimes, my dog even lets me sleep on the bed.
lqdjmb,I can relate. I'm a huge dog person, never met a dog I didn't instantly melt over. Except my roommate's dog who is actually really cute but it's 100% the way she fails at taking care of it and having to deal with her yelling at the dog or then super, almost over-coddling it 10 seconds later that has made me grown resentful about having a dog in the house. But when she's not there and I walk past his crate, he's a sweet boy. It's just my roommate's "training" that I'm resentful over.
lqdjmb,Poor dog. Yelling followed by coddling is bound to confuse the poor pup.
lqdjmb,I can totally relate to this post. My best friend moved back into her family home after finishing her degree down in the USA (we're from Canada!). I absolutely adore dogs but never had the pleasure of owning my own. For some odd reason, I couldn't stand it when her family dog is active around the house. Their pitbull jumps up and would claw up my arms and legs because he's just too excited to have people around. This doesn't just happen when people arrive, but the entire time guests visit. He will get on the coffee table and knock over drinks.  You can't leave food unattended on the kitchen counter. If you leave your bag hanging on the coat hook or chair, he will take off with it. He loves to steal shoes and hide them in his bed. He will beg, whine and vocalize his frustration. It got to the point where I asked if the dog could stay in his crate while I visited.His behavior didn't change until her parents went away on vacation. It was like night and day. He was so well-behaved; no begging, no whining, and no jumping. He would listen to commands. My best friend was the main caregiver to this dog until she left for University, then the dog became a family dog. Her parents lapsed in his training and let him get away with everything while she was away. All those manners snapped back once he realized she held the keys to his food, toys, and walks.Like someone else mentioned. There are not problem dogs, just bad owners.
lqdjmb,FWIW, Kids operate pretty much the same way.  My nieces and nephew were/are all nightmares of whining, crying, begging and arguing around their parents, yet perfectly pleasant little people when they are alone with me because they know those behaviors don't do them any good.
lqdjmb,I‚Äôve had this conversation with my brother who‚Äôs a parent, and he said part of it has to do with who the child trusts more with their emotions. I wonder if it‚Äôs the same with dogs.
lqdjmb,My little brother was the same. He's 12 years younger. When I took him somewhere and said I would drop him back home if he misbehaved, he quickly learned that I meant it! My mom didn't have the same luxury, bc often there was no one to leave him with when I was away at school. She still says he's "scared" of me.
lqdjmb,I didn‚Äôt see the original post, but from reading it just now, I definitely got the impression that it wasn‚Äôt a dog problem, but an owner problem. Some pet owners can be insufferable when it comes to their pets.
lqdjmb,Ive always said that its not dogs barking that bothers me in a neighborhood, but the owners that yell at them to stop barking.'Bella!  Bella , stop! Bella!  Bella COME HERE .  HERE NOW!  BELLA COME!get a fucking leash or dog run.   (They finally did. Small miracles)
lqdjmb,Lmao that's my mom!!! Drives me insane!!! I don't think she understands that her dogs match her energy, so if she's all wound up, ofc they'll be too!
i8jgfi,I loved your tl;dr and thought you were making a joke. I'm glad your life is doing better.
i8jgfi,Thank you. Not a joke! Just gay.
i8jgfi,Welcome to r/actuallesbians
i8jgfi,Congratulations on everything.   It was a bit frustrating in your last post seeing you constantly brush off the actions of your friends and partner.  It's great to see you realized you don't deserve that.
i8jgfi,Thank you. I was in a lot of denial and really just wanted to keep the status quo and not upset anyone. But you're right, I deserved better. :)
i8jgfi,Prolly always knew it..
i8jgfi,Good riddance to any partner who refused to stand up for you. Glad you're out of that situation and safe! Good luck with your girlfriend
i8jgfi,Good riddance is right! Thank you!! I just asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes. ü•∞
i8jgfi,oh my god, they were roommates
i8jgfi,I had pretty much the exact same situation as you in college. I had a really good friend group, but one of the guys liked me and took it REALLY badly when I rejected him. He proceeded to bully me mercilessly, and gaslight my friends to say I was causing drama/it wasn't that bad. Similar to you, I received zero support from them. I have also cut off every single person from that group and am better for it. Not only was the guy himself absolute trash, but my friends weren't real friends if they could stand by that behavior. Best of luck to you in your much improved life!
i8jgfi,Thank you! Cheers to finding new friend groups :) I hope you're doing well!
i8jgfi,This happened to me too. Im still in touch with a couple of them but not in a major capacity. I felt like I was going insane from everyone acting like I was in the wrong and ostracizing me because he was "easier to deal with if I wasn't around." Also they let him do it to another woman who was in a long term relationship but she actually cheated on her bf with him. None of them said anything to him that time either and said they'd get mad at me if i got involved because "he's easier to deal with when he's getting laid." Im sorry this happened to you. Its never right and its amazing how shitty people let eachother be. Im glad you dumped those chumps.
i8jgfi,Wow, a post-2yr update. Thanks for sharing your story and congrats on your current relationship.
i8jgfi,so what WAS John's deal? was he gay and in love with David?
i8jgfi,I have no idea. We never had a real conversation about it. A lot of people in the old thread seemed to think he was interested in me, which is plausible. I think it may have been a combination of that and him abusing both alcohol and weed.
i8jgfi,I hope everything goes well with your family! I'm glad you got out of it all üòä
i8jgfi,Thank you, I hope so too!
i8jgfi,Honestly you realizing you're gay makes this update even better lol I'm glad u have a supportive partner now
i8jgfi,Thank you :) I wish every coming-out went this well!
i8jgfi,I remember your original post, so I'm so glad to see a positive update! Congratulations on your new relationship! I wish all the best for you! You deserve good things and good people in your life!
o0buhm,From a bi woman monogamously married to a bi man, I also want to express my reassurance that this doesn‚Äôt change the dynamic of a marriage. My husband and I both discovered that the other was bi after we married, and the knowledge has only positively impacted our relationship. It‚Äôs been lovely joking about people we both find attractive, having the same celebrity crush, and just feeling more open expressing certain parts of our identities.I remember hearing something about attraction while being in a committed relationship. The relationship doesn‚Äôt blind us to other people who we may find attractive, however we can admire a beautiful painting in a museum without wanting to fuck it. With this in mind, my husband and I can easily chat about things and people we find attractive, without feeling insecure about our relationship. My husband, as I think your husband did as well, married me because he loves the prospect of our future and family together. Attraction is just one small component of this.
o0buhm,I wish that I could be secure enough in my relationship to listen to my boyfriend expressing attraction to other people. Somehow the very thought of that boils my blood.Then again, I‚Äôm personally very insecure about myself, my boyfriend is an extremely conventionally attractive man, and our relationship is 7 months old.
o0buhm,My husband and I are both heterosexual and we will randomly comment about the beauty of either men or women in the shows we binge. She has beautiful eyes. He has amazing hair. She has nice boobies. He has fantastic abs. Doesn't take away from the shows, and it doesn't make us bi, either. I don't know why people think it's difficult to outwardly appreciate things that we find attractive in the opposite or same sex without being sexually attracted to them. Humans can be beautiful and asthetically pleasing without wanting a sexual relationship with them
o0buhm,That's- actually really amazing of you guys to do. I on the other hand, will probably NEVER be able to do go on with the day if my partner says he finds another attractive. I start overthinking, and crying for days about it. I'm glad you guys can, but I hope to never be this open with my partner, knowing that it would crush and hit me hard one day.
o0buhm,Straight spouse with a bi husband here as well. Glad you had such a good resolution! I completely understand why you feel/felt insecure, but at the end of the day it's about trusting your partner in the same way that you would if they were straight.
o0buhm,I don't mean to speak for OP's husband or any other potentially bi dudes in straight relationships... but for me, I am still unsure about how exactly bisexual I am. I appreciate that I can just generally discuss what's attractive to me, with my wife.I assume I'm bi because I find dudes attractive sometimes. however, back when I was single, I kissed a very attractive dude once, he was a great  kisser, and I wanted to run away the moment his beard touched mine lol.I have no interest in going after dudes, even if I was single. I also am very happily married, and I find my wife insanely hot.but this is something I didn't even consider or think about - that there's some spectrum of sexuality, and I'm somewhere on there too. straight is default, and I've only dated/liked/slept with women so it would be "easy" for me to just put myself in a box. but obviously I have some other thoughts, feelings - which are cool too.so it's wonderful to have a partner who accepts me, who lets me be myself. there's no risk whatsoever in me dating anyone else. this is  just a process where I'm getting to know myself better, and my wife is getting to know me better as well.
o0buhm,As a bi woman in a monogamous straight passing relationship, I just wanted to assure you that this does NOT mean he's suddenly going to want to sleep with men or open your relationship or anything like that.Many of us bi folk are bi AND still 100% monogamous regardless of the gender of the person we love. Just because we're bi doesn't mean we HAVE to be in relationships or have sex with other people of other genders all the time, and just because we're in a relationship with someone of the opposite gender doesn't mean we're straight and just confused either.Monogamous bi people are in a relationship with the person we're with, we're attracted to them and we love them. Sure, we may have attraction to other genders, like, celebrity crushes etc, we may watch porn of same genders or have passing fantasies... but our real focus is on the person we're with. It's no different from a straight person having passing crushes or dreams about other people than the person they're in a relationship with. It doesn't mean anything beyond just an imagining.My BF of 16 yrs recently came out as pan & is exploring being gender fluid as well, but he knew I was bi from when we first got together and our monogamy has never been a question. Regardless of our orientations and how our self identities may evolve, we love and are attracted to each other first.So don't let your fears project onto him (although your worries are totally normal and understandable). Keep that open, loving, trusting communication going and you won't get any surprises. Keep creating the safe space of loving communication and sharing with the focus on solving problems as a team instead of making each other the problem & you two will always be able to figure things out.Edited because I realized I missed a few words & a couple if things didn't make sense. Thinking faster than I type lolEdit 2: I'm very moved at the response this comment has gotten. Much love to my fellow monogamous bi's out there, but in a platonic way only of course lol (And I have nothing at all against ethical non-monogamy, neither is "better", what's best is what works for the people involved!).
o0buhm,Yep, another bi woman in a monogamous straight passing relationship. Been married 20 years, and been faithful.
o0buhm,As a bi woman in a monogamous straight passing relationship, I just wanted to assure you that this does NOT mean he's suddenly going to want to sleep with men or open your relationship or anything like that.Coming from the other side (straight man married to a bi woman), this is 100% true. Bi does not mean poly, and it doesn't mean someone will cheat. It just means you get to ogle the same gender together (which, I might say, is quite fun - if you're into that sort of thing).
o0buhm,Same. Bi woman with a straight husband. I would never want to explore female options while married to him. I am satisfied with it just being us and being bi does not give anyone a pass to explore their sexuality if their partner isn‚Äôt ok with it.
o0buhm,Yep yep! My bestie is bi like me and we are both married to straight men. My husband feared I would want other women when we first started dating but after a brief explanation he was cool with it. Do I like to look at pretty women? Sure. But I wouldn‚Äôt want to throw a grenade into my awesome marriage.
o0buhm,I'm another bi woman married to a straight man, totally monogamous. I've thought about this a lot, and I think that part of the biphobia we experience is rooted in this weird concept that while you're in a relationship with someone, you stop being attracted to other people.That's not true for straight monogamous couples either, though. Unless you're somewhere on the ace spectrum, other people are still attractive in all monogamous relationships- you just choose one person. Bi and pan people are simply a reminder that attraction remains, and that makes so many people uncomfortable.
o0buhm,THIS! 30+ years monogamously married, still bi. My husband is perfect for me, but that doesn't mean that a woman or trans or non binary person might not have been perfect for me either. OP's husband LOVES her! He's exactly the person she knows and loves - she just knows more about him. He hasn't changed, only her knowledge has.
o0buhm,100% this. I am a bisexual woman and I have been in a straight relationship for the last 17 years. It never occurs to me to cheat on my husband. All it means is I am attracted to both men and women. That‚Äôs all.
o0buhm,I just wanted to reiterate this. There is a stereotype that bi people are more promiscuous, but it‚Äôs not true. At the same time, though, some people use their bisexuality as an excuse, or think that cheating with the same sex is just ‚Äúhaving fun‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt count as cheating. Unfortunately I‚Äôve known more than one person who has cheated with the same sex and said, ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôm bi so it doesn‚Äôt count.‚Äù I had a gf who slept with another girl at a party and couldn‚Äôt understand why I said she cheated on me. Cheating is based on the person and has nothing to do with their orientation
o0buhm,I was going to say this too. I'm a big old queer pan in a faithful, exclusive relationship with a straight boy and no one can turn my head. I've always valued monogamy and I can only be with one person at a time.I CAN love ANY orientation or gender identity. That's not the same as wanting multiple options to be satisfied.Good luck OP, really glad this worked out. ‚ù§Ô∏è
o0buhm,What is the difference between bi and pan? Don‚Äôt they both mean you‚Äôre attracted to both men and women? It just seems a little redundant both I don‚Äôt know much about it.
o0buhm,As a bi-woman happily married in a hetero relationship, I whole heartedly agree.We have had a few three and foursomes but that was mutual choice I believe helped open me up to the fact I'm bisexual.In saying that, just because he may find men sexually attractive doesn't mean the marriage is over or will have to become open to satisfy him.Watching porn together can really help open you both up and satisfy each other's cravings.Definitely have an open conversation about boundaries and what makes you both comfortable. We have had many conversations about it's not sex it's about falling in love that is a major concern for us both but if your relationship is strong with good communication you could find new exciting things to explore together if/when ready.
n21e9c,Before you do anything I think you need to sit down and talk with your dad. Tell him exactly what you are feeling and exactly what you fear. Be open and communicate with him.
n21e9c,This. But try not to worry too much. All signs point to the fact that your dad sees you as his family. The fact he never wanted the test and things haven't changed between the two of you. I think the only reason he wants the test is because as his child he wants to secure your future and your grandpa's money for your education.
n21e9c,Yes -- but also, OP, during this conversation, I suggest asking your dad if you can start seeing a family therapist before you make a decision about this. Someone who can see you alone, AND facilitate sessions together with you and your dad. I assume you have a few months at least before you HAVE to make a decision about this? I think sorting out your feelings with a therapist, and getting them to help you talk really openly with your dad, might make this all a lot easier.
n21e9c,This all day. You have to talk!
n21e9c,Couldn't have said it better myself. Personally, given you're 17 and he literally raised you, I can't see a negative paternity test changing a damn thing between you two. Any asshole can be a biological dad, it takes a man to be a father. And he has done that for you it seems. I think the upset (and this is worst case scenario) would be 100% between your mother and father.
n21e9c,Oh babe, this must be really hard for you and I'm sorry you're going through this.There is nothing you can do, this is your father's decision. It sounds to me as though your father didn't care about the test and loves you unconditionally. It sounds like your grandfather on the other hand may have some other, dated, notions.Sit down with your father and tell him exactly what is on your mind - read him your tl/dr. Express your love for him, stepmom, step- and half-siblings. Just tell him you're scared and ask what he thinks.Good luck, OP. It's going to be ok üíõ
n21e9c,This is nice advice. It's best to communicate how it makes you feel. I'd love to know how it goes too - but I don't think you need to worry about your dad only loving your new sibling - he's already loved you for 17 years I'll bet you're pretty important to him!!
n21e9c,im worried he won't love me if it goes wrong.reading that broke my heart :( I agree with this though.
n21e9c,This is good advice except for fact it‚Äôs entirely dad‚Äôs decision. OP gets to decide if she gives a DNA sample to dad. Check the laws on where you live OP, but often even at your age you need to give consent.
n21e9c,Just to add, OP seems to worry about the half sibling influencing his decision. I would counter it's likely not that at all, but rather OP's age. 17 is the age where most parents will start to worry if the college fund isn't neatly taken care of yet, because college is happening soon.
n21e9c,Girl has to provide dna so it's really a joint decision no
n21e9c,I might get downvoted but this is not a good advice IMO. I know you come from a good place but...We don't know OP's father. There are plenty of shitty people who abandon their kids after finding out they are not biological children.Some people are just not willing to give others unconditional love, and the fact that there is a bio-baby on the way just... makes the timing pretty awful.Even when there are not blood relation doubts, parents usually reaffirm their love and the place their kids have when there is a new baby, specially from a new spouse.OP's dad not only has a new baby with a new family and is not reassuring OP, but actively trying to find out in this sensitive moment if they are biologically related.So... we can't say that it is just the grandfather. If it truly was, OP's dad probably wouldn't even bring this up.The grandfather is rubbing in OP's dad, even if he isn't a complete AH like his own father, he just shouldn't be pressuring OP like that or making up excuses about schooling finances or whatever bull**** he comes up with.I do agree that OP should express how she feels to both of them (mostly the dad though).Her dad is being an AH. Not quite like his father, but not very great either. He needs to reaffirm his love for OP and drop this test until OP decides she wants to know the truth. He may be a loving father, but he isn't acting like one right now.
n21e9c,I agree with this and feel like it might be worth having a similar conversation with Gramps. If writing a letter sounds less painful, try that. Maybe when approached directly he would be less likely to double down on the DNA component (which seems totally unreasonable given that you‚Äôre almost an adult and have been part of his family your entire life).
n21e9c,I agree with this except for 'it's her father's decision'. OP would have to voluntarily share her DNA sample to get a test done right? That seems like something she should not legally be forced to do.
n21e9c,She can refuse the test
n21e9c,This is wonderful advice.
n21e9c,First of all, this is a shitty situation. I'm sorry you're in this.Your dad could just lie to your grandpa and say the test was taken and you're his. Might not be worth it to cause a big fight since the grandparents are on the way out. As for student loans, there is no way you'd be required to take a paternity test before your dad applies for FASFA (or whatever it's called).Have you sat down with your dad and really laid out your fears? Tell him that regardless of what would come back on a test, you consider him to be the only father you want. Tell him that you'd rather not know for sure, as there are some things that cannot be unlearned. Tell him that you'll never forgive your mom for ruining your family life, and that you're both victims of her actions.
m4t5wl,If you own the place I would suggest changing the locks. ASAP. Gathering anything that was hers that she left and drop it off in front of her friends house. And then reward yourself to feel better (watch a movie, read a new book, buy new shoes, etc.). And then maybe have a family gathering with your mom, sis, and bf and buy some pizza and stuff to apologize for the craziness and hurt that your ex caused.
m4t5wl,Way ahead of you. I changed locks the day her sister changed the diaper on the couch.
m4t5wl,I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this and I know it probably doesn‚Äôt feel like it now but you are lucky she revealed herself for who she is before the wedding.You‚Äôll have a much better life without her.
m4t5wl,What I wonder is, if looking back OP can recognize a pattern of drama with this woman. Mostly likely not aimed at him before or he might have mentioned it, but she must have started drama on the regular with many people, including customer service people. You simply can't hide a personality like this for 3 years.
m4t5wl,I think you took the right decision. I also want to mention that your Ex's-sister could have brought your sister in serious danger with her "anonymous message". You said your sisters Ex-husband was abusive. What if he freaked out and it ended in a relationship crime? That's seriously a careless act of your Ex's-sister.
m4t5wl,Thank you. While her ex husband was never physically abusive, this was a big concern for me. Apparently he just blew it off, and blocked everyone.
m4t5wl,So sorry you have to experience this, just focus on how lucky you really are to have dodged that bullet. Damn, she would have been an entitled nightmare of a wife. Good for you. I hope your sister doesn't feel guilty about it, i would worry that it might happen.
m4t5wl,I've already talked with my sister about it.  Apparently, there had been times in the past, ex fiance had gotten drunk and tried to start shit with my sister about me.  My sister didn't tell me about this until after the breakup, but apparently it contributed to my sister distancing herself from my ex.
m4t5wl,Already have.Come to find out that there had been numerous occasions when I was away for work, she would be up til 3am drunk and ranting and calling numerous friends over the past year or so, just trying to talk drama about someone. Come to find out, several of those times was tryingbto stir up drama against me.  Those friends shut her down. I have definitely found out who my true friends are through this, and the friends I lost through this, weren't really friends at all.
m4t5wl,I can't wrap my head about her trying to start drama about you ? If she was successful in that and y'all married wouldn't she look as bad as she was describing you ? Also sounds like if you would've gotten married, you would've been cleaning up all her drunken messes, and this would have left you with friends and family cutting you off just so they didn't have to deal with her. Doesn't seem likely that she would ever take responsibility for her actions. You dodged a bullet, sorry you had to go through this.
m4t5wl,My brother dated and nearly married a woman like this. I think there are just some people drawn to causing drama and being at the center of attention.
m4t5wl,Congratulations!You were willing to compromise, she wasn't.You were communicating, she wasn'tYou were honest, she wasn'tYou were understanding, she wasn'tYou chose her and your family, she chose her familyShe's manipulative, and an emotional blackmailerShe has no mind of her own, controlled by her sisterYou have a great family, she obviously doesn't, and wants to wreck yoursYou dodged an ochestrated attack on your familyShe's not loyal to friendshipYou did the best and right thingPlease be conscious of your environment.Change locks and let people know you're not with her anymore. So if they see something, they don't assume wrongfully.It will hurt real bad, but you'll see a nice lady, and you'll be fine.
m4t5wl,Good job dodging the bullet, her and the sister sounds like a nasty piece of work.
m4t5wl,You dodged a lifetime‚Äôs worth of bullets my man.
m4t5wl,Luckily it's a nicer faux leather couch that wipes clean easily. Already had dogs that had an accident on it before lol
m4t5wl,I find it surprising that you didn't know how drama-prone she was after 3 1/2 years. I wonder if that is because she was able to hide her drinking and personality deficits because you were on ships a lot. Maybe something to consider for the next woman who comes along.
m4t5wl,When I came home unexpectedly, I found 7 empty alcohol bottles throughout the house, as well as over flowing trash and old dog poop from the bad freeze over Texas a few weeks ago.  These were those big handle almost gallon size alcohol bottles of gin and rum, and they weren't there 3 weeks prior before I left. It looked like something from a hoarder. For a long time just a few days before I would return home, she would complain about having to ckean the entire house, now I know why.  Evertime I came home the house was decently clean, but never looked liked she had sent days cleaning.  She had been hiding the true amount she was drinking from me while I was gone all this time.
m4t5wl,The dirty diaper on the couch is what we call ahole tax. It‚Äôs the price we pay to get these people out of our lives. The trick is to get smart enough to recognize aholes before the bill comes in.
msx4sa,So happy the two of you were able to be open and communicate with each other about this!Please make sure you continue this communication and have an action plan in case your lives take a separate turn from each other as you pursue this serious joint purchase.
msx4sa,Congratulations on y'all having a difficult conversation to mend bad feelings and begin finding solutions. I hope y'all are able to alter things in a way that gives you both what you want without sacrificing healthy behaviors and respectful communication tactics. It sounds to me like y'all are back on track or at least getting there. It can be hard at times to swallow your pride and admit fault (ie your ultimatum as well as her lashing out at you), but these actions are great investments in your relationship. Best wishes to both of you. I hope y'all find ways to continue to improve your communication as you each grow and change. Cheers again on this breakthrough!Edited to add: I really think it could help for her to seek professional guidance on managing stress as well as couple's counseling, and maybe you speaking to someone to deal with your unresolved pain of her having lashed out in the past.Y'all avoided a potential issue with her taking on a stressful job, but relationships, transition into marriage, wedding planning, purchasing a home, having children, and many other life changes (or lack of change like stagnation, boredom, or the feeling of being unfulfilled) will eventually occur. It is normal to be stressed sometimes and have occasional anxiety, but it is not acceptable for anyone to resort to emotional and verbal abuse as a way of dealing with those emotions.You both deserve to be respected and to be in a safe environment: emotionally, physically, and sexually. To prevent a relapse of her behavior it is a good idea to seriously consider professional assistance in order to find the root cause of her bad coping strategies and to replace them with healthy strategies. I have multiple anxiety disorders, and I have intermittently sought out therapy when I find I am utilizing unhealthy coping skills.
msx4sa,Good communication; nice work!Don‚Äôt buy a house together without being married.Best of luck!Edit: if you live in the US, don‚Äôt buy a house together without being married. Cannot make legal recommendations for other countries!
msx4sa,Or sign a doc that details how the house ‚Äúdivvys out‚Äù if they break up or divorce. Prenup that shit.
msx4sa,Ikr I would recommend only doing so if you have solid documentation that lays out what will happen with the house if you break up.Also the housing market is a mess right now. Get ready to have to fight hard and pay well over the asking price or go with a new development
msx4sa,Seems very different in the US, where I'm from it's extremely easy to claim 50/50 ownership of house and mortgage ‚Äî no extra paperwork aquired. It's just a natural part of the process of buying a home together, I guess?Partner and I have been together for 11 years, not married ‚Äî no kids. Some extra work om your tax returns with the homeloan, otherwise it's all the same.
msx4sa,As always, communication is the key to happy relationships.
msx4sa,Hard agree. We may be old school with this line of thinking but I certainly cannot recommend agreeing to get a house with someone before you guys have a legally recognized relationship. It would be very messy were something to go awry in the relationship.
msx4sa,While this is good advice for some it‚Äôs not exactly good advice for all. I got engaged and then we bought a house. The money we had saved for the wedding went to the down payment. Two years later we had a smaller scale wedding. I‚Äôm glad I went that route and wouldn‚Äôt have done it any different. I would rather have had a house than a large wedding and financially it made sense. I am also from a very unstable home so setting down roots was top of my list as well.
msx4sa,Why not buy a house without being married? Just curious.. have owned a home 5 years with my partner of 8 years. Did close to equal house down payments and currently split the mortgage and utilities. We also live in a common law state so that may change things from your perspective. To us, it's a nice way to share a larger commitment without having to split all our assets and share incomes down the middle.. We don't really like the institution of marriage and would only do it if we decide to have kids.. Which may not happen.
msx4sa,I always see this advice but in my area literally everyone buys before they get married. That is, if they get married at all.
msx4sa,Don‚Äôt buy a house together without being marriedCame here just to say that, it can get ugly if yall break up having bought a house together, especially if say one of yall is on the deed and the other isn‚Äôt but helped with the down payment, then there‚Äôs no legal recourse for the latter party.
msx4sa,Good for you guys. I've always said, the cornerstone to any successful and happy marriage is communication.
msx4sa,Did you mention to her that you will not tolerate being her personal punching bag this time around?
msx4sa,Hey, I'm glad you guys worked things out. But...did she acknowledge the severity of the abuse she put you through during her last stint at a stressful job? You describe that time as "the worst years of your life" and say that even now, years down the line, you feel "fear and panic" at the thought of repeating that to the extent that you felt the need to lash out the way you did. Was lashing out wrong? Yes, technically. But you didn't do that as some manipulative tactic because you wanted to get your way. You did that because you were traumatized from her behavior and it caused you to respond impulsively. She may deserve some sort of apology for that, but you deserve a huge apology from her for the way that she treated you when she was under stress. Stress is not a good enough excuse to yell at someone consistently for three years. Life contains stressful events, and at some point, everyone has to learn how to deal with stress without abusing the people around us. Most people can manage that, even when they are under considerable stress. I'm very concerned that you don't mention your girlfriend acknowledging the pain that she caused you. I'm very concerned that you appear to be taking full blame for lashing out this one time, when your girlfriend lashed out consistently for a very long time and gave meaningless apologies only to continue the behavior. This is all very concerning, honestly. Please take care of yourself.
msx4sa,Why do you assume this wasn't acknowledged already, seeing as that period came and went several years ago?
msx4sa,How is this not higher up.
i4jkl6,These are words that can never be unheard or apologized for enough that I would ever be able to let them go. And you shouldn‚Äôt want to be with someone who throws around statements like ‚Äúsexually disgusting‚Äù and expects those words not to have a life-long impact. I don‚Äôt see how you could forgive and forget that.And even setting aside that statement for a second, he‚Äôs also heaped other choice sentiments on you. He is cutting you down so you think you don‚Äôt deserve better than this, but you sure do. It‚Äôs not love if it‚Äôs one-sided. This marriage doesn‚Äôt seem to have a solid foundation to even fall back on to rebuild. You can build something better with someone else.
i4jkl6,Exactly this. Honey, you are exactly someone‚Äôs type. You are someone‚Äôs perfect woman. There is someone out there who would find you so drop dead gorgeous that he would call in sick to work just to spend the day with you. You don‚Äôt have to settle for mediocrity. You don‚Äôt deserve it.
i4jkl6,I agree, and it sounds like you both could benefit from counseling at minimum. If you don‚Äôt feel ready to leave, that‚Äôs a good first step to help figure out whether this is really salvageable.
i4jkl6,So your husband has called you a prude, fat, and "disgusting sexually"?Forget the whole 'is it a big deal if he's not physically attracted to me?' thing. Do you really want to be with a guy who says those kinds of things to you?
i4jkl6,I also find it amusing that he's overweight but says his preferred type is "petite athletic women" like cool I can say my type is guys who bench press tigers in their free time but I'm probably not gonna land one if I don't hit the gym at least occasionally myself?
i4jkl6,And has never reciprocated oral. I am stuck on that.
i4jkl6,I'm worried about language too. The way your describe him is with pure infatuation and love. You forgive him misteps and avoid tricky conversations, careful to ensure he feels your love. His language towards you has been appalling. Growing old and becoming unattractive isn't something people do BTW, people who adore each other don't notice that their partner is slowly changing, and they don't care. I'm also concerned about you calling oral sex a favour. It isn't, it's a part of intimacy and ensuring that your partner is having a pleasurable experience.
i4jkl6,He‚Äôs with her because she adores him and feeds his ego, which gives him security and boosts his fragile self. That‚Äôs it. He can abuse her verbally and she stays. I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say he has most likely cheated. More than once. OP, talk to a lawyer. Release yourself to find someone who actually loves you.
i4jkl6,This. I couldn't even imagine saying something so awful to my SO. Op deserves better than this deadbeat husband.
i4jkl6,Exactly this. They're not even friends if that's how he talks to her.OP. I'm fat. There's no dancing around it, but my boyfriend makes me feel like the most attractive person in the room most of the time. There is someone out there for every type.
i4jkl6,Right?  It wouldn't matter if they fucked like rabbits, the fact that he's willing to say insulting things during an argument, just to hurt her, is a far bigger red flag.There are healthy ways to discuss a failing or failed-to-start sex life in an intimate relationship.  Calling your partner a sexually disgusting, fat prude is NOT the way.
i4jkl6,Also, do you really want a guy who thinks this of you when there are at least a million guys out there who will give everything he is AND think you're a walking, earthbound goddess that ticks all their sexual boxes?Life's too short to settle.
i4jkl6,Step one: buy him a long mirror. Step two: leave Step three: get to the gym and get healthy for YOU. Step four: get a cat
i4jkl6,I don‚Äôt understand how you can claim to be in love and be such good ‚Äúfriends‚Äù...when he insults you the way he does.  I‚Äôd never say something like that to a friend in anger.I feel like there is more you aren‚Äôt telling us.  I can‚Äôt see this being an otherwise picture perfect relationship if this is how fights go between you!
j9skka,This will be a huge weight lifted from your heart before you know it. Being direct is so important and saves so much pain in the long run, even if the experience isn‚Äôt pleasant (aka is devastatingly sad) when it‚Äôs happening. You‚Äôre better off and you‚Äôll be just fine. Be gentle with yourself and focus on self-care and having talks with friends or finding little distractions.
j9skka,Agreed. Good for OP for confronting a situation he was too immature to address.  And while you can be upset with him and feel angry and you'd totally be justified in feeling that way just try to understand that frankly it's pretty common for young folk.  Shitty, but true.But yea, you're already rockin it, you're going to be fine!  Cheers!
j9skka,That's been what I've been doing! I've taken a few days off work to see my friends and do things like clean and care for myself. I really spent a lot of time worrying over him and the situation that I didn't give myself any outlets for myself, since I think I only had the capacity to worry about one thing at a time. At least I have the relief now! Thank you :)
j9skka,One lesson I wish I had learned earlier in life (I‚Äôm 36 and happily married now) was that if a relationship is ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù it‚Äôs not working. When in a happy functional relationship you won‚Äôt feel confused. People are often cowards when it comes to breakups. They are afraid to hurt your feelings so instead they lie and conceal how they feel which ends up being even more painful. That‚Äôs why you feel confused. Realizing this will make it a lot easier to know when to move on in the future and probably save a lot of heartache <3
j9skka,Please make a post about this? People really need to hear this.
j9skka,Hey can you make a post or dm me about your experience with this. It seems enlightening and interesting
j9skka,This is the real truth.If you have to question what the other person's feelings are and they won't be up front, move on because doing anything else is (a) wasting your time, and (b) needing others more than your own self-respect will always leave you played in the end.
j9skka,It's a coward's breakup. Act distant and unavailable until she breaks up with you. I've definitely been on the receiving end of it, and it shows someone way too immature to be in a relationship.
j9skka,I wish I could upvote this more. So true
j9skka,This is how my ex went about it. Basically disappeared for 2 weeks right after I had a big Easter get together with his family. Extremely confusing. Awful. We had a breakup talk that he instigated but like there was nothing that happened, nothing I did wrong he had no reasons behind it. Sucky thing to do but oh well.
j9skka,There's a great quote from Christina Hendricks' character in Mad Men that relates to this:"Men don't take the time to end things. They ignore you until you insist on a declaration of hate." -Joan Holloway Harris
j9skka,This is how my fianc√© let our engagement end when we had to do long distance after 6.5 years together. It‚Äôs the lowest, worst thing you can do
j9skka,Yes it is cowardly but they're 18 years old in really just kids.
j9skka,This is exactly what my ex did. Started ghosting me and sending 2 or 3 word responses. Guys that do this are trash. Don‚Äôt ever take them back. I wish I hadn‚Äôt.
j9skka,You have to understand hes only 18 and doesn't have the communication skills needed to be direct yet.Lots of people that age do not.Its a good learning experience that they both went through although I know OP didn't want it to end.I hope they both grow as adults.
jcwxd4,I don't think you want him to be your dad, you just want to be treated with the empathy and respect he treats his children.So tell him how you feel, just don't say "I want you to be my dad." That'll probably spook him, but beyond that yeah tell him you've never seen a parent treat their kids right like that and it makes it feel amazing to be around him. And how much you want more of that. I'm sure he'll feel flattered for basically being called an awesome dad, and then he'll feel able to become more emotionally close to you.
jcwxd4,All of the feelings OP is describing here sound like part of a healthy family dynamic, not just a healthy parent-child dynamic. "Spouse" is a family role.
jcwxd4,I think it‚Äôs a very good sign you recognized the difference between families. It‚Äôs the road to healing, and it seems like your boyfriend would be a very kind and loving person who would understand if you opened up to him about it, especially because he has kids of his own and you can see how he is with them.I‚Äôve been through a lot of abuse with my family, but I also recognize I don‚Äôt want anyone to ‚Äúcare for me‚Äù. There‚Äôs a goal to being financially and emotionally independent to bring out the best in yourself, and your partner because there is so stress on reliance.It seems like he can be a wonderful person in your life, but always strive to be the best for yourself and he will emotionally support you as you do. Best of luck in your healing process from my heart to yours.
jcwxd4,This is a very good answer
jcwxd4,This is the correct answer.
jcwxd4,I also think she respects and admires how her boyfriend treats his kids. It‚Äôs an admirable characteristic. A lot of people are parents, but not many are loving and patient with their own kids. Plus, I think a lot of adults that envision themselves having kids in the future look for a partner that could love their kids if they ever had any.So, perhaps these feelings you‚Äôre getting from being around him and his kids are just admiration and respect. From what you describe, I think many people would feel happy/safe around him knowing he‚Äôs a caring, patient, and empathetic father. It‚Äôs a good quality to have.
jcwxd4,I agree with this.I‚Äôm a single mum co-parenting with my emotionally abusive ex & when the kids are with their dad & I go to my boyfriend‚Äôs house he cooks dinner for me & pours me a drink & it‚Äôs like... someone cares how I feel and wants to look after me, this is amazing. He‚Äôs not my dad, he‚Äôs my partner, but he‚Äôs doing things to take care of me. And then I do things to take care of him too.OP, I don‚Äôt think you necessarily want your partner to be your dad, but you want your partner to love you in the same gentle and nurturing fashion in which he loves his children because you‚Äôve never had that, and I think that‚Äôs totally valid.
jcwxd4,Yeah. And I get what she‚Äôs saying... but really it‚Äôs more like, I wish I had a dad like you. I can see what it‚Äôs like to be one of your kids and I wish I was as lucky when I was a child. In fact, she could even say Man, you‚Äôre such an amazing father (and describe the feelings she gets when she‚Äôs around him and his kids) and I wish you were my dad, too! And laugh about it, like, obviously not because that would be weird haha but I just want you to know that you‚Äôre doing such an amazing job.
jcwxd4,40 year old lady here.Lots of people who had shitty parents look at their partners and friends and think "I wish my parents were like that." Heck, people with good parents might still look at a great parent and think "Dang, they pulled that off better than my dad!"It's not that you want your partner or friend to parent you, it's seeing someone do good and wishing that you had it back then with your parents.What you need to do is focus on what a good partner he is to you. And you need to start giving yourself the love you needed as a child.
jcwxd4,I second this. I also had shitty parents and never felt safe until I met my husband. I don‚Äôt need him to parent me, nor does OP need that (it seems). But it‚Äôs nice to feel protected, cared for etc. by my partner and best friend and finally feel safe. The wires don‚Äôt need to be crossed but the energy described here is relatable.
jcwxd4,Or conversely, I am very fortunate and had a wonderful childhood, I‚Äôm still very close with my family. My partner will do something that reminds me of my dad and I go wow my dad does that and be a little weirded out but I recognize that it is a positive trait. At first I‚Äôm like wtf that‚Äôs gross but the more I think about it, I‚Äôm just recognizing good qualities in my partner that resemble the way I grew up. To me, that just means we are on the same page and express kindness and love in similar ways. I agree, I think it‚Äôs a good thing that OP things her partner is a great dad. I also think it probably means that he‚Äôs a compassionate person and a good partner that can give her love.It‚Äôs like that thing that moms tell their daughters sometimes, ‚ÄúMarry someone like your father‚Äù I thought that was fucking weird for a while, but after dating some terrible people and growing up a little bit, I realize she means find someone to spend your life with that treats you well, that is endlessly kind and gentle, and that would do anything for you in the way that you would do anything for him, a good boy.
jcwxd4,Just wanted to let you know that your words really touched me. Struggling with mental health and childhood trauma and self love feels like a decadence reserved for others but the way you phrased it hit home. Thank you <3
jcwxd4,Yes if OP hasn‚Äôt done it already, inner child work would be wonderful and helpful for her. I love a book called homecoming by John Bradshaw for getting into this work
jcwxd4,Yes! And, the way your partner is with his kids can be inspiration for how to give yourself the love you didn‚Äôt receive. When you have a memory come up of something that happened when you were a kid, or something happens in the present that brings up similar feelings, you can imagine your adult self responding to that part of you the way you‚Äôve seen your partner respond to his kids.Let yourself soak up all the feelings of warmth and love and safety that you feel when you‚Äôre with your partner and his kids. And when grief or anger comes up too (and it will, for all the things you wish you‚Äôd had or wish hadn‚Äôt happened to you), be with it the same way your partner would be with his kids when they‚Äôre feeling sad or angry.
lu2z2g,in my early 20s i really became aware that i had a problem with confrontation (never wanted to insult anyone, always tried to get out of uncomfortable positions by making a joke out of it etc.) and i promised myself that the next time i found myself in that position i would put my foot down no matter how unsettling it felt. i can't even remember now what the 'next situation' was, but i followed thru with my promise to myself and the RUSH of adrenalin i got from doing that convinced me to never go back to the way i was. i still falter sometimes, but for the most part i've gotten really good at standing firm. it's a great feeling. i'm happy you did it as well! congrats on your now stress free wedding!
lu2z2g,Yeah... it took me until my 30s (am 36 now, F) to be more assertive. But it feels so good to be able to say "no." Kindly but firmly usually is enough, but I can escalate now if need be.Age/maturity really helps. Especially when you're a tiny Indian woman (adopted, am Swiss).  The white hair helps too. The more I have the more serious people take me haha...
lu2z2g,It feels so good, doesn‚Äôt it? Thank you for the well wishes!
lu2z2g,Yes! You go! The early 20s are so fun and exciting and you have SO. MUCH. FREEDOM. But you (I know I did) still feel like a kid. You can't say no, without explaining yourself etc. Now I can say no and it's a whole sentence! I don't owe you shit. I can confidently make choices and stand by them!
lu2z2g,Great update! You handled the situation very, very well.Congrats on your upcoming wedding. I wish you and your spouse a long and happy life together!
lu2z2g,Thank you so much!
lu2z2g,Bravery is a skill, not a trait. Like any skill, you build it up over time by practicing it. You build it up even faster by using during difficult situations. And, unfortunately, you can forget it if you stop using it for a while.
lu2z2g,This is something I had never thought of before. Thank you for this perspective. I'm going to be thinking about this for awhile.Edit: Guys... Don't upvote this... Upvote the thing I'm responding to, which was the actual useful thing! I just came here to say thanks...
lu2z2g,Love this!
lu2z2g,I love this.  I need to remember this more often   it really is true, but it's so easy to fll back to staying safe.
lu2z2g,I love this.  I need to remember this more often   it really is true, but it's so easy to fll back to staying safe.
lu2z2g,This is fantastic.  I'm just sitting on the couch and clicked on this post thinking oooh juicy... And then realised halfway through I knew the back story because I read your original post!  I half feel like I'm eavesdropping on a gossip fest and half like I just caught the finale of a show I was a bit invested in.  Glad to see a happy ending!!  Well done standing up for yourself; you'll find that with practice in doing it less people will make it necessary.  You'll develop an aura of "I won't tolerate bullshit", congratulations for taking the first step.All the best!
lu2z2g,I thought I was gonna just tell him to stop but the words just rushed out of me in the most wonderful way. I still feel like I‚Äôm on top of the world!
lu2z2g,Also, I've been to a few courthouse weddings, and they're QUITE romantic. They're short, sweet, and, since they're secular, there's more poetry than at church weddings.Anyway, congratulations, and good for you. I wish you save your SO much happiness <3
lu2z2g,This guy Jack sounds like a dumb drama queen, like he's a 45 year old man, why does he go around telling people he's upset, you guys are not in high school.
lu2z2g,Yeah he's emotionally immature. He likes the feeling of authority he gets from giving advice to others. Now he's upset because someone has shut that down so he's looking for reassurance that it's ok to do.
lu2z2g,All he is has is adhd and loves to be center of drama.
lu2z2g,He reads as autistic to me, he doesn't know social boundaries and can't see why his opinions were hurtful to OP and she finds him annoying from social cues. This has probably come to a shock to him that she's 'suddenly' acting 'mean' towards him because he couldn't read the signs that she was uncomfortable because he was so enamored with his special subject, which happens to be weddings/flowers. I've got a few friends on the spectrum and you have to be blunt towards them, (and myself too I'm dense as fuck and my adhd knows no bounds when it comes to annoying people) first time but polite? Like "hey I'm glad you're excited about x but we are doing y instead and aren't looking for input or advice thanks, anyway how was your weekend?" And if they persue "look I dont want to talk about this anymore, its getting to be a boring topic" is fine to say. I struggle to read people aswell, I can tell when people are upset but not when they're trying to be polite and make me leave lol
mh6y0w,Harry didn‚Äôt take this well and exploded. He started cussing me out.It's amazing how quickly people show their true colors. That definitely tells you his apology was not sincere and he probably would have continued to pursue your fiance under the radar.
mh6y0w,Kind of appalling how often the ‚Äúnot sorry they did it, but sorry that they got caught‚Äù phenomenon happens, honestly.
mh6y0w,honestly. his ridiculous claim that he was already over my fianc√© made me laugh. i cant believe i didn‚Äôt realize his intent sooner when we were friends
mh6y0w,Right. What they say after they apologize really matters.
mh6y0w,Congratulations both on your engagement and your losing a non-friend weight off your back.
mh6y0w,thank youu
mh6y0w,Congratulations! I‚Äôm happy for you guys.And glad you‚Äôre branching out and found an activity to do together. What book are you reading? :)
mh6y0w,reading Thinner by Stephen King currently. thanks for the congrats :)
mh6y0w,Congratulations on the engagement, and congratulations on losing a false friend!
mh6y0w,thanks!
mh6y0w,Harry belongs on the nice guy sub
mh6y0w,I didn't read the original post but this was enough to understand what it happened. Yeah that guy is not a real friend and I'm glad you put him out of your life. I'm glad this had a happy ending. Congrats!
mh6y0w,Wooow, great how this turned out! Thanks for the update and congratulations with your upcoming marriage. Lots of love!
mh6y0w,thanks for the congratulations. i‚Äôm a very lucky guy
mh6y0w,Forget Harry! Your life and your relationship and your mental heath are all looking up! I'm so happy for you! Keep moving onward and upward, and forget Harry ever existed. I wish you and your fiance all the love and happiness in the world ‚ù§
mh6y0w,Congrats on your engagement!!And I'm sorry you had to go through that kind of hurt of losing a friend, but luckily he showed his true colors and you were able to cut him out of your life.Good luck in the future!
mh6y0w,Congratulations on your engagement!!!! And for standing up for yourself. I'm sorry you crossed paths with a terrible person. He sounds really manipulative, so please don't blame yourself for being friends with him in the past.  But hopefully it will help you see red flags in the future. Finding people with common interests, like books, is definitely a good way to go.
mh6y0w,yeah now that i look back on it i can see all his manipulative behavior. and honestly can‚Äôt believe i fell for it for such a long time. i now realize why him and his boyfriend had such a messy break up when he claimed to have ‚Äúdone nothing wrong‚Äù sometimes it‚Äôs hard to see the real person when they put a blindfold over your eyes for such a long time
mh6y0w,I hope that this teaches you to trust your instincts and listen to your gut. Don't be sad that you lost a friend. Be glad that you had the guys to call them out on their bs. You did great. Congratulations on your engagement!
mh6y0w,Yeah, "I can't help my feelings" only goes so far. There's no reason for him to confront the object of his affections unless he wants something to happen as a result of that, ie, your bf leaving you for him.I'm so happy to hear you're engaged!!
mh6y0w,People may not be able to control their feelings, but they can definitely control their actions!
let91g,This is a great update and I'm glad you two were able to talk. But coming from a person who has been married for 10 years and we still have communication hiccups, please work on communication before you get married. Communication in any relationship, at any time, is hard. And you cannot have a healthy relationship when neither of you are getting your needs met, or when you're not telling each other your concerns without pulling teeth.
let91g,Agreed. My husband and I are solid, but when we had some unexpected life-changing events occur (he was transferred out of state, I can't join him for a while), I got us into marriage counseling so we could work on communication. Divorce was never on the table, but we were arguing nearly every time we were together. Just the few sessions we attended helped us get back on track.Communication is a never-ending cycle. I recommend to anyone in a long-term relationship to keep counseling as an option for when things get tough. Sometimes it takes a new perspective to see what your significant other needs, and vice-versa.
let91g,My marriage of almost 10 years failed due to a lack of communication. It's essential for a healthy relationship. What a hard lesson to learn.
let91g,People always look at me like I'm crazy when I say stuff like this, but I'm a big fan of prophylactic couples counseling just to develop communication skills. So many problems can be prevented by understanding how to have a constructive conversation with each other. I compare it to getting your dental cleanings instead of waiting until you have a toothache to go to the denting. It helps build a much stronger foundation for your relationship.
let91g,Thank you for the advice, we really both do need to improve our communication skills, and that‚Äôs something we‚Äôre working on.
let91g,Agreed. I thought my husband and I communicated well, until we ended up in therapy for "mismatched libidos" in our first year of marriage but our therapist said our communication was the more likely culprit, so we worked on that for 6 weeks. 7 years later and our marriage is in the best place it's ever been, our sex life is crazy good, and we're able to tackle issues as they pop up with empathy and compromise.But it's taken fucking work to get here.
let91g,What concerns and needs has your husband expressed over those ten years?
let91g,This is what I started to do with my husband, we would pick a day and a time for when we were going to discuss important topic or decisions. My husband did not like to immediately start talking about big life decisions in the moment but knowing that there is a discussion that was going to happen allowed him to think about it beforehand.
let91g,I‚Äôm so happy I found this. I‚Äôm the kind of person who gets emotional/needs to talk about things in the moment, but my partner often feels like I bring big things up out of the blue and it really stresses him out. I want to try this approach and see if it makes these kinds of discussions easier for the both of us.
let91g,I read your original post and I remember thinking uh, oh- that's not going to go well. I'm so pleased that I was wrong! Keep up the communication and good luck!
let91g,Wow that's actually something that put a smile on my face at the end... The way it started it sounded like things were gonna turn sour at any point onwards.. I'm happy for both of you, that's actually something to look forward to, it's a good thing that u were able to come up with that hard topic that usually puts people on the verge of tears and discomfort and to come out of it unscathed, with a smile in your heart, well that's a Great thing, now your future is ever brighter, I'm deep down happy for you and yuur boyfriend, make the best of it.
let91g,Thanks so much!
let91g,I am in your same situation and my mom and my older brother advised me to move on. I'm just waiting for March when we hit our anniversary, if nothing happens by then I'm moving on. Sucks but it's true, if they don't talk about a future with you it means they don't see one with you or just not ready at all. We have to move on and stop wasting our time.
let91g,In my first post, I specified that we did in fact discuss all this several times before we moved in together, it was just once we moved in together that he stopped wanting to have a conversation about it.
let91g,This didnt really resolve much for the big question? Seems like he is content with buying more time without giving you an answer to your question of marriage
let91g,It sounds like she‚Äôs laid out a timeline and he‚Äôs said it seems reasonable. Hopefully he keeps to his word! It was very similar to me before I got engaged. I made my timeline clear for kids, and my fianc√© planned accordingly. So it can work.
let91g,So essentially he can procrastinate until your timeline and then keep pushing it out.
kju0nt,It‚Äôs amazing how much more clearly we see things when we don‚Äôt have someone clouding our vision.In your case, you held your loyalty to your best friend above all, and then you were crushed to find out he‚Äôs not who you thought he was.I‚Äôm sure if you reflect on your relationship with him, you‚Äôll see other things you let slide that you probably shouldn‚Äôt have. The cheating thing was your proverbial line in the sand.Chalk it up to experience. It wasn‚Äôt all bad. The relationship served you for that time, in the way you needed. It wasn‚Äôt a failure.Keep Moving forward, and finding new friends. You‚Äôll be amazed at how many good people are in the world that you haven‚Äôt even met yet.
kju0nt,I'm in a similar process of trying to kick out a roommate/old friend that I have basically outgrown. She is SO ANGRY,  all the time, and my home needs to be my sanctuary. She's made it so unbelievably toxic. She's pissed that I stopped smoking weed, and that I have been working towards education and getting a better job. A real friend would be happy for me to have goals. I'm sure it sucks, and I'm sorry that it's happening to you. But it's good to get people with so little morals that he would help someone cheat out of your life. Here's to the next chapter of yours. üëç
kju0nt,Yeah same ive got a best mate and I‚Äôm fine with him most of the time but I was giving him free meals, food, someone to hang out with (he has no tv, pc, or entertainment apart from His phone which is just fucked) and I‚Äôm a drug user but trying to clean myself up and he‚Äôs doing the opposite and has been IVing Heroin, and about 6 months later I started noticing I had pills missing (I take benzos and opioids for medical reasons, and even my weed just didn‚Äôt seem right) and eventually connected the dots and realized he‚Äôs just been going through my drawers and shit to steal my meds. Whilst I‚Äôm asleep.Forgave him like 10 times, now I just don‚Äôt ever have him over anymore and he‚Äôs not happy about that,Just don‚Äôt bite the hand that feeds you
kju0nt,I had a friend who was fucking a girl... and he was friends with her boyfriend. There are some moronic types that think only the person making the commitment are to blame. They are the person you should direct most of your anger at, sure, but the other person is still a steaming pile of shit.I stopped being his friend because that isn't someone I want in my life. No reason to waste your time and energy on someone who has shown they have no regard for other people. They are trash, so good riddance =]
kju0nt,This response makes it so clear what healthy boundaries look like.None of us have to tolerate or be involved with people that you no longer have a positive response to. It‚Äôs just a waste of energy and sacrifices your own health and happiness.
kju0nt,You know you did the right thing. Curious to how much notice you gave him to leave? I'm sure he acted like an ass the entire time
kju0nt,Mazel tov on your 26 days of sobriety! That's huge.  I'm proud of you.  Keep it up!
kju0nt,Good for you! Once you change your surroundings, life can get much better! Congratulations on getting sober!
kju0nt,Exellent decision, I hope things continue to improve for you, and you get better friends!
kju0nt,What do you mean helped her cheat? There seems to be no clarification to what that means
kju0nt,In the Original post:To answer some of the questions: yes he pursued this girl while she was still in the relationship, yes I was involved because he brought the situation into my home before she split from the child's father (this was after I had made it clear that my home was not to be used for their affair)
kju0nt,I also had a similar experience. One of my best friends had an affair with a married woman. They were both caught since it was being done at work and were fired.  Husband of the woman found out and girlfriend of friend found out too. Both couples decided to work on their relationship, but my friend was still secretly seeking the other woman. She ended up asking me for the woman‚Äôs new number and I said that I didn‚Äôt think it was fair that she was still seeking her out after her girlfriend gave her a second chance. She told me her relationship was none of my business, so I decided that I no longer needed her as a friend. It is still hard right now to not talk to her whenever I see something she would like or find funny. But I think it‚Äôs for the best. Sometimes you just discover you have different morals and friendships are broken.
kju0nt,This is a great update. I'm sorry he turned out to be such a shitty person, but I'm glad the ordeal of trying to.decide how to proceed with him is over.
kju0nt,Congrats on 26 days! If you think it would be helpful, check out r/stopdrinking. When I first quit drinking the support I found there was invaluable. So proud of you!!
kju0nt,Thanks for saying "every day" instead of "everyday". Oh, also... good job. Onward and upward.
kju0nt,Good for you have a merry christmas.now do the correct thing and tell that guy his girl cheated . P.S.tell him she cheated.

kju0nt,I‚Äôm happy for you. You did the right thing. It can be very hard to cut someone off that you‚Äôve been close with forever. However, you were able to do it not only for yourself but to let him know that what he did was wrong hopefully he‚Äôll learn from this and you will have less stress on your back.
kju0nt,I read your original post, I remember it and thanks for the update! Yay for you.
hpkndz,Oh man. I broke my foot last year on 4th of July and that's when I learned my ex didn't care. Kudos to both of us for getting out!! Yay for broken feet? Lol
hpkndz,Yes, I guess in the long run one good thing came out of it for us? Sorry you went through that but glad got out :)
hpkndz,Yay for broken feet?"One simple trick to find out if your partner is a POS!"
hpkndz,LOL i got into an accident on fourth of july and that's when i truly learned how little my ex cared about me too
hpkndz,Yeah, he was treating you like garbage, and deserved to be thrown out as refuse in response. Leaving toxicity is so freeing once you're away. As I said to an earlier poster, when I left that asshole, I was over it. Almost immediately. Just couldn't give any less fucks. Good on you.
hpkndz,I had a similar experience. By the time I left we had been fighting for so long that I felt nothing after, I didn't even cry over it. It just felt liberating.
hpkndz,I'm sure when they get to the the new place and think about things they will realise even more toxic things the Ex was doing.Sometimes you need a bit of retrospective to identify it all
hpkndz,Yes, but he also is very stupid. Not knowing what a fracture is stops being OK around perhaps 10 years old.
hpkndz,This is a moment where you can take a whole new road, or stay on the one you‚Äôre on. Because he will be super sorry tomorrow and you‚Äôll realize you can maybe work it out and stay together, or really follow through with it. You‚Äôre pissed right now (rightfully).But If you‚Äôre like me, that anger will wear off and you might start double guessing this break up. Which might be fine. I just keep thinking of a similar relationship I had in my 20‚Äôs and there was a long time of being unhappy, getting mad, working it out, being unhappy (I even had a similar injury/guilt trip thing).Then one time I just stuck to it and moved out. It wasn‚Äôt even that huge of a fight that spurred it, just the realization that although my boyfriend wasn‚Äôt terrible, he was just kind of a jerk and even though starting with him was easier, it wasn‚Äôt really fun.Anyway, getting out of that cycle was the best thing - I ended up meeting someone way, way more right for me. Good luck to you and I hope your foot heals quickly.
hpkndz,Thank you! I'm definitely not going to change my mind and go back.
hpkndz,Good for you! I fractured my wrist while very drunk, at a punk bar, in a mosh pit (I was 26 too, not even a kid üòÇ) and my husband laughed at me, but was very supportive otherwise. Shit happens, and being salty about it isn‚Äôt cute.
hpkndz,I‚Äôm proud of you, what an asshat that guy was.I fractured my foot entirely sober getting out of a bunk bed, had to wear a cast on it for almost a month. That shit is a broken bone, and since your ex couldn‚Äôt take that seriously I think he might‚Äôve had a broken brain.Congrats on your escape from his toxicity, girl. It‚Äôs not easy to call a spade a spade sometimes.
hpkndz,For sure, it is definitely something to be taken seriously. Very painful as you knowing. Hope you healef up fine. And thank you!
hpkndz,As someone who also broke something on July 4th and whose partner has been the most wonderful angel through it all, well done ‚ù§Ô∏è
hpkndz,I got a small fracture in my foot from tripping on a dog toy. I ended up in a cast for 8 weeks and a boot for 4. My husband was so attentive. He took care of me, drove me to my appointments, and made sure I had everything I needed before he went to work. When he sprained his arm after a bicycle accident, I dropped everything. I got him food and water, pillows, helped clean his scrapes, and even got him a brace. Because that's what partners are supposed to do. When one of you is down, the other steps up.
hpkndz,I'm so very happy your husband has been so supportive! I hope you heal quickly.
hpkndz,Having fractured my foot before as a kid and requiring a boot, it is very serious and requires the same treatment as a break, the only thing is it didn‚Äôt break all the way through. A fracture is still incredibly painful, I doubt this fool even understands what a fracture is. He probably thinks it‚Äôs akin to a bruise. My Ex was this way when I had a knife fall into my foot on his birthday, complete accident that happened while unloading a dishwasher, he treated me like it was my fault and I did it on purpose to ruin his birthday and take his attention away.I‚Äôm glad you broke up with this boy, he is completely selfish and you deserve so much better than that. He‚Äôs not thinking about anyone but himself and showing you his true colours. You‚Äôll find the right guy some day, who treats you right and looks after you when you‚Äôre injured, I found one and he‚Äôs so kind and caring almost to the point of it being annoying.Times are hard right now, but try to keep your chin up and love and care for yourself, be kind to yourself, at the end of the day you are the most important person to yourself, so don‚Äôt worry about the loser who couldn‚Äôt appreciate the great person that you are.
l9jhzy,I think you should have someone you trust present when you tell him it‚Äôs over.
l9jhzy,Yuuuup, this. Abusive and manipulative people are the most dangerous at the end of the relationship, but they won‚Äôt be as toxic around you if they think they‚Äôre being watched/judged by another person. OP, maybe ask a friend or family member if they‚Äôre comfortable moving in for a spell.Edit: Reddit goofed and didn‚Äôt put this as a reply to this comment at first oops
l9jhzy,OP this √ó1000. Leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time for women. Just because he hasn't touched you yet doesn't mean he won't. I'd also suggest making an exit strategy with your therapist.
l9jhzy,PLEASE, OP. HAVE SOMEONE THERE.It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abusive relationship on your own. There are thousands of ways for your abuser to bring you back into the relationship, and if that doesn't work they will likely resort to violence or sabatoge. Please have someone you trust, a friend or family member who knows what's going on, with you when you take this step.It is the single hardest, nerve wracking, difficult conversation and having an ally makes it easier.Please also consider contact the national domestic abuse hotline or talking to an advocate via their website. They will help you create a safety plan and give you local resources that can help you heal in the long run.
l9jhzy,I recommend having someone over WHEN YOU BREAK UP. That sounds wild, but this guy sounds wild. And if he decides to get even more aggressive you don‚Äôt want to be caught in a big problem. Perhaps a friend in a different part of the house? Because at this point it seems like you‚Äôre making a statement, not having a conversation. He needs to be told this is it and given a deadline to leave. A friend will also keep him from groveling as badly. Please don‚Äôt find yourself particularly alone with this man once you do it.
l9jhzy,Yes! My ex was exactly the same, narcissistic, emotionally abusive, the full works.When I told him it was over he refused to accept it. He cried, begged for another chance, when I got up to go away from him he followed me, stood over me, laughed at me, stood in the doorway to block me from leaving, tried to goad me into hitting him (idk what that was about). I got my phone out to call my brother and he physically wrestled it out of my hands.It wasn't pretty. These people have appearances to maintain, though. They don't tend to act up when there are other people present.Good luck, OP! You're doing the right thing.
l9jhzy,200% please have someone over. I came here to say this as well. Please keep yourself safe OP, and don't be alone with this man. Change the locks when he's out.
l9jhzy,Yes, this. OP, please have someone over.
l9jhzy,Seconded. Please invite another adult, or two, whom you know and trust.
l9jhzy,Came to say this. Please please please make sure you have someone with you, or that you are not present in the house.
l9jhzy,More than this, OP needs to put cameras in the common areas of her home so she will have video evidence should something happen.
l9jhzy,Yup. My emotionally abusive ex hit me for the first time the first time I tried to break up with him. He sexually assaulted me the second time.
l9jhzy,I was thinking this as well, I hope OP will see these comments because who knows what the other might do.
l9jhzy,If there‚Äôs no one around you that you can trust just call the non emergency line of the police and ask if you can have an officer present - this may be needed for when you move out too
l9jhzy,Please be safe, please stay away, and preferably do the breakup by phone in a safe location or at the very least with another person as a witness.  Very rarely the women who got killed by their partners thought they would be killed by their partner and the family and friends are "shocked" and "never expected it" and "he was a good neighbor"
l9jhzy,My best friend's husband snapped one night and brutally murdered her and her unborn child.We don't know why but I think she told him she was done as he was abusive. Do not be alone with this man when you break up with him. Also, have a locksmith nearby to change the locks immediately after he is gone.Do you have a father or brothers who can be with you?
l9jhzy,I'm sorry for your loss. Unfortunately I know the feeling. I hate to fear monger, but abusive people need to be taken seriously.My best friend was murdered by her ex, she had broken up with him 3 weeks prior. He wasn't getting treatment for severe lyme disease that was causing mental problems. He took his family's gun, ambushed her while she was walking her dog and then drove off and killed himself.Reading to the end of the post where she says they're still together, 8 months after the last post, ngl my heart sank. She needs support to get safely away asap. I would want to move for a fresh start if at all possible.
l9jhzy,Also up your security game in general. Cameras if you can, a camera doorbell at the very least if you can't put them everywhere. If he starts harassing you after the break up, keep records of everything. Do you like dogs? You could foster a big dog if your health allows. It'll help you with some of the inevitable loneliness and make a much better companion than your current one. Maybe have friends stay with you sporadically over the next little while until you're sure he's not going to snap.
l9jhzy,I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss.
l9jhzy,Do you have a father or brothers who can be with you?I mean she said in the post that her father was an abusive narcissist so I doubt having her father there would be a good idea.
l9jhzy,Even another female could be a deterrent. Don‚Äôt write off the capabilities of an entire sex.
n7yj49," So now, not only do I have to drive 40 mins away to pick up last min gifts for his family ..."No, you don't have to. In part, he treats you like this because you tolerate it. You need to set the bar higher and ask more of him because he's treating you like crap and taking you for granted. This whole business where he spends all of his time with his friends and leaves you to fend for yourself is something that a serious discussion needs to be had about. You feel like an afterthought because you are one, and you need to require that to change or it is all you'll ever be.
n7yj49,You need to set the bar higher and ask more of himShe would literally be happy if the father of their child would gift OP a little parenting time as a present. That says a lot.
n7yj49,Exactly! From what we‚Äôre being told, he barely helps around the house, doesn‚Äôt put an ounce of effort into gifts, and sends OP out to do his own work... why? Because OP lets him.OP, If you read this- you need to sit him down and be firm. Explain how you feel, how things need to change (and lord, not JUST the gifts) and if he doesn‚Äôt... bounce.
n7yj49,This OP ‚¨ÜÔ∏è It seems like the problem isn‚Äôt about the gifts per se, but about the effort he puts into your relationship. Obviously I don‚Äôt have the full picture and I am an outsider looking in with only your side of the story, but a relationship is supposed to be a partnership where each partner does their fair share in the relationship. From what I read it does not look like a partnership, it seems more like you‚Äôre his mother, always going above and beyond without any help, support, or appreciation. And I hate saying this, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like he respects you for all the work you do and for who you are as a person. You deserve better and deep down you know you deserve better. There needs to be a serious conversation and I think some couples therapy should be in order because this won‚Äôt change overnight and you can‚Äôt let him say he‚Äôll change, go two days and then revert back to his old self, bad habits die hard, but you‚Äôre strong and deserve better. I wish you all the best, hun x
n7yj49,Well the first thing you should do is NOT go get anyone chocolate.
n7yj49,Yes!  This drives me nuts when I hear women (or men for that matter)  say "my partner did abc so now I have to defg" no you don't,  you are an adult with free will.
n7yj49,It‚Äôs not her fault for not training him right or some shit though. It‚Äôs his fault for not meeting minimum standards of human decency.By all means have the talk, OP - but don‚Äôt be surprised if it doesn‚Äôt get better and be very prepared to walk away - because he does not respect you.
n7yj49,Exactly this. He has a new born baby and he is behaving like an undergrad. There is no reason for him to be away from you and your child that long, and there is no reason she should be doing chores that he us too lazy to do.Expect more if him and let him deal with the consequences when he fails. Don't pick anything up for him. Tell him that he needs to babysit while you go out and see your gurlfriends.Make it clear that he needs to be a part if rearing and chores. If he is resistant, force his hand. If he is off work, make dinner for yourself and the baby + do your laundry, and let him fend for himself.
n7yj49,yeah, I feel so sorry for women who can't see that their relationship is not good for them, and how on hell those women always have to have babies
n7yj49,I am not OP but I agree 100%. This is not a single incident. Sorry OP but you have been enabling your husband for too long. Hanging out with friends from 12 to 4 AM? This is not an isolated incident. It should have been bought up sooner.I would refuse to buy him anything and take the baby to your family for a few days. Please stop being his bang maid. And you have to have the determination to do what you need to do so one day you won't have to look back and regret it.
n7yj49,"in part, he treats you like this because you tolerate it" is bollocks. It's "look what you made me do" and "behaving like that, she was asking for it" in a shitty disguise. I understand that boundaries are a thing and that we are all responsible for our selves. This douchebag is a douchebag and you're saying that it's her fault because she's not gone full Trunchbull on his ass and whipped him into line. Rubbish.
n7yj49,I stopped buying things for my MIL about 3 years into our marriage. The first time she didn‚Äôt get flowers on Mother‚Äôs Day, my husband changed immediately. They‚Äôre his relatives, not yours. Also, stop buying him gifts.
n7yj49,Exactly. I have always seen my Mom in charge of choosing and buying gifts for the whole family, including my Father's side, and my Dad always seemed completely clueless as to how he could do the same for her. That's an other aspect of the mental load that a lot of women have to deal with.That's why in the 7 years of my relationship with my fianc√© I have always refused to take care of my in-laws gifts: I can discuss with my partner to help him find good gift ideas, and he does the same for me, but ultimately he has to buy, wrap, and send/give it. And I do the same for my family. Since we think about the gifts together we agreed to say that they're from us both, and everyone is happy.I know that if I started to do it for him I would soon be the only one in charge of it, because it feels more easy for me. So I'd rather avoid falling into bad habits.
n7yj49,For father's day he should get two red bulls and an unsigned card. For his birthday, divorce papers.
n9c90l,You fought for her. That's amazing. I know we're strangers, but I was a 17 year old once, and I know how hard it can be to stand up to the adults in your life at that age, so I'm really proud of you. And I'm glad your sister has you in her life. You did a good thing.Tell her that her drawing is awesome!
n9c90l,You are an amazing brother and I commend you for standing up for your sisters education.I have a degree in American Sign Language and Deaf Culture and I know how isolating it can be for Deaf children who are forced to mainstream into programs that don't cater to their specific needs. I'm so glad that you had a Deaf and HOH advocacy group reach out so they can help your parents make informed decisions on what is best for your sister.Good job. :)
n9c90l,I am severely hearing impaired, have been since childhood, along with my brother.   I was raised in the hearing world and have always had to accommodate the world, never had any idea the world should maybe try to understand me, and I want to applaud you for standing up for your sister!  If you aren't hearing impaired or deaf, it's very hard to understand how casually you are excluded from things, with impatience or thoughts that you aren't very bright.  Putting your sister with a group of people with the same impairment is going to grow her confidence by leaps and bounds!  Kudos to you for being a wonderful big brother!!
n9c90l,I don't have any experience with the deaf community, but this whole post and your comment made me realise how excluding the world can be. I would absolutely love to be educated more!
n9c90l,I'm sorry that happened and happens to you.I saw OP's original post and was SHOCKED her parents didn't have her in any classes or groups with other deaf people!I'm so glad too she has a great older brother.
n9c90l,I know I can never fully understand what it's like but luckily Ana is EXCELLENT at making her thoughts and feelings known and I can't wait for her to start meeting people like her!
n9c90l,Hi! I might give you some insight on the Special Education world. My training is in working with the blind and before that linguistics/language development (important in HOH education). I also worked at a school similar to what Ana is going to.All children in the USA are physically and educationally protected by the ADA laws. Families are permitted to challenge their school districts for free and equatable education. ALSO... look up the Expanded Core Curriculum for her diagnosis. These are like the Bill of Rights for kids with disabilities. Even if you are not in the US, ever country has an equivalent via the WHO.parents need space to grieve not having a ‚Äútypical‚Äù kid. Grief is displayed is many different ways. I‚Äôve seen parents who are helicopter parents, denial (to the point of physical neglect, denial emotionally and then passing it off as ‚Äúnot treating disabled child differently‚Äù, depression, etc.the private school I worked at was for blind children but they were actually medically fragile with blindness. However, (good news) the more abled children still benefited from one-on-one care. One child I worked with was deaf-blind and had been bouncing around foster care. The teachers, staff and specialists all were in one building and could customize the education and learning for her. Like you‚Äôre sisters, she had ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù issues, but once she was given the support she needed that was relieved.I know that the private school staff will push to have her in a public school when Ana‚Äôs ready. It‚Äôs drill into our head to give all students ‚Äúequal educational opportunities‚Äù. No special education teacher would ethically have Ana there if she would blossom elsewhere.3) private vs public special education does involve federal and state money. It is possible Ana‚Äôs school district is pushing for the more localized school. It‚Äôs probably cheaper (but doesn‚Äôt mean less than). The deaf school might be residential  or private bussing services might be an added expense. Right now your sister qualifies for an interpreter in class. However! Professional ASL interpretators aren‚Äôt grown on trees and there‚Äôs always a shortage. Depending on Ana‚Äôs school district, there may not be enough qualified staff to fulfill the school district‚Äôs needs. When that happens, districts will try to centralize the students in one place.Special education needs vs special education professionals are a huge jigsaw puzzle.4) if you are in the USA, ADA protects student needs.
n9c90l,This is super helpful, thank you!
n9c90l,That's so bizarre that they're choosing to send her to a school for kids with mental impairment and mobility issues when there's literally a deaf school they could send her to.Honestly this doesn't sound like much of a compromise, they're still just sending her to the school they want for zero rational reason and trying to placate you by saying "well maybe if it's not good we'll pull her out sometime in the future."
n9c90l,Someone in the original thread was totally downvoted for saying that his parents are just throwing her under the rug thinking she's being sent to like an institution but I agree, that seems like it's what the parents want. They don't want to deal with a child that's even slightly abnormal or hell just not extra special like their smart children. They don't care. Also someone else downthread even said his parents may come from an era where "schools" for the disabled are just institutions but you'd be surprised how far they've come!! Like yeah, they probably think that's what it is. That's what they want.Fuck this guy's parents. So many people in the other thread telling him to stay in his lane, he just thinks he knows better better because he's a smart alec. Reminds me of all the grown ass adults shitting all over Gretta Thunburg because she's a teenager, how could she know anything? Ridiculous, this guy knows what he's going and has great emotional intelligence,  I feel so bad for his sister.
n9c90l,I agree. To me personally this is unacceptable. They're indirectly telling their child deaf = disability = bad, intellectually inferior, which I'm pretty sure is the exact opposite of what the deaf community believes. On top of that, early childhood development and education is CRITICAL. As in what a child learns, feels, and experiences will have huge influence on her brain development, long-term behavior and mental health.
n9c90l,At the end of the day the final decision rests with the parents. At least they've listened but honestly, it's up to them to decide what's best for their daughter so this sounds pretty much like the most OP could have realistically achieved.
n9c90l,Speaking as former student who has graduated from Oregon School for the Deaf, and have been attending mainstream from pre-school up to 9th grade (10th-12th grade was at the deaf school), I can personal say that my social experiences were much different.Do keep in mind that most oftentimes, deaf institute does not offer same level of education as mainstream may offer. This is often caused by HUGE variety of students' backgrounds, with some being growing up having absolutely no communication accessibility, to those that has been neglectful with their education. However, my BEST experience was to being able to communicate with everybody in my own language that i can understand the most.My mainstream had Deaf/HoH program which advocate for our accessibility of education, such as making arrangements to have interpreter, 1 on 1 sessions and such. While that is amazing on its own, it could hinder the social development as it would requires less time of being around with peers. I was severely bullied and harassed throughout my time in mainstream up to where i personally decided to want to transfer to my deaf institution- for the sake of better social experience.If anything, while your sister is not going to be attending to the deaf institute, I would ENCOURAGE you to maintain your contact in the deaf/hard of hearing community. Reach out to people, and try have your daughter being introduced to the culture and language itself.You are amazing SODC (Siblings of Deaf Child/ren), and i applause you for taking steps in making sure that your sister would have the accessibility for her education. She will NEED you to help her through, so PLEASE stick with her when you can!PM me if you need any more info on deaf institute or ways to reach out to the community, i may have some ideas depending on where you live.PS: MOST of the time, your town should have a Facebook group delicates to deaf community, such as Deaf Night Out, Deaf Night Chat, etc. Do check around on Facebook, I'm sure you'll find some groups!!_\m/
n9c90l,I am pissed you got bullied. Sorry, you experienced that.
n9c90l,I'm sorry you got bullied. I know how shitty that feels (middle and high school were hell for me)BUT we aren't ruling out mainstream or deaf school yet. Hopefully soon I'll be talking with some local deaf/HOH individuals who went to school around here and getting their experiences and advice! Thanks for your support!
n9c90l,Whale says, "throw garbage off the dock and you're gonna get the glock"
n9c90l,As they should!
n9c90l,This is awesome. You are taking good care of your sister and I'm sure a lot of people here feel proud of you. It's also very brave of you finally talking to someone (in this case a professional) about your feelings about your childhood. Keep taking care of yourself too :).
n9c90l,This is so exciting! Thank you for advocating for your sister!
nmhloz,I am so so happy this worked out as well as it did and you got comfortable!!! I just married my childhood best friend of 24 years earlier this year and being married to my absolute best friend has been the most amazing experience ever
nmhloz,Thank you and congrats on your marriage! I guess I just couldn't conceptualize the idea of dating a friend and not having it be awkward. It feels amazing to know that we don't have to stop being friends, but that there's a new element to our friendship now which can make us even closer. I just never wanted to choose between friendship and dating and now I realize that I never actually had to choose. It was silly to panic so much and the sense of calmness and peace I feel now is just incredible
nmhloz,I've been married for 20 years now to somebody who was my best friend before we started dating. It really can work very well. Congratulations on your marriage, and best of luck to OP!
nmhloz,I would say as someone married 16 years with 2 kids, go ahead and marry your best friend if that's what you both want.   Romantic love fades but friendship lasts through thick and thin.
nmhloz,I also married my best friend. It‚Äôs fantastic.
nmhloz,I am pretty sure I just barfed sprinkles
nmhloz,Mine came out all glitter, should I see a doctor?
nmhloz,And here I am, puking confetti
nmhloz,Are unicorns prancing in your field of vision?
nmhloz,A wise woman once told me ‚Äúto make sure I marry my best friend.‚Äù That woman was my grandmother and she was married to my grandfather for 50 years. Although I am just now reading your story I am so glad you gave him a chance. He already knows everything about you so the hard part of deciding wether or not you will like each other is long gone in 7 years. A random guy you meet could not nail the first date the way he did because a random guy is not going to know your favorite movie or favorite candy. Definitely though make sure you put as much effort into dating him as you would any other guy. If you normally get dressed and dolled up for dates do the same for him. Just because you have hung out in PJs before doesn‚Äôt mean you should slack on dating attire. Congratulations OP I am glad you didn‚Äôt over think the situation to the point where it didn‚Äôt happen. Trust me he is just as nervous as you and thinking all the same things you are!
nmhloz,Trust me he is just as nervous as you and thinking all the same things you are!The thing I appreciated the most was he gave me a big hug when he came to pick me up and basically just reassured me that there was no pressure and that we were gonna have fun either way even if I decided to just remain friends afterwards. I immediately felt at ease when he did that. I had been shaking so badly beforehand, but he has such a calming presence and warmth about him. I instantly felt safe and happy with him and was able to finally move on and enjoy the eveningDefinitely though make sure you put as much effort into dating him as you would any other guy. If you normally get dressed and dolled up for dates do the same for him. Just because you have hung out in PJs before doesn‚Äôt mean you should slack on dating attire.Good advice, thank you!
nmhloz,This makes us all happy
nmhloz,It really does. Warms me ol heart
nmhloz,I think my favorite part of Reddit is the collective, solidifying comments like this.This is amazing OP! Love is an excellent rush.
nmhloz,I want to puke at how adorable this is. Congratulations OP!
nmhloz,Exactly how I feel. So so freaking cute.
nmhloz,LOVE this! Started dating my best friend after 2 years of friendship, now been together for 7 with our first baby on the way ü•∞. Dating your best friend is THE best.
nmhloz,I never understood what it meant when people said your boyfriend should be your best friend. With my past boyfriends I never ever felt that and now I can say my bf is truly my bestie! It really is the best/ way it should be.
nmhloz,Congratulations on the baby!!
hodnvv,I‚Äôm proud of you. You identified a problem and you made the change to better yourself, even if it took you a while to get going. You got this friend.
hodnvv,Just to piggyback on/add to this: While I can't speak for everyone, it seems to me that taking the steps to identify the problems and take action to fix problems/meet personal development goals is something that many people don't do sometimes, myself included. Kudos to OP for this, I think that deserves a lot of respect!
hodnvv,Bruh, I remember your original post.I‚Äôm so, so proud of you. If you don‚Äôt hear it from anyone else, know that you‚Äôve made someone on this big ole planet proud of you.
hodnvv,Just remember, life is not a sprint, it‚Äôs a marathon. You need to go at your own pace. I speak from experience of making a shit ton of my own mistakes. I didn‚Äôt figure out what I wanted to do till I was 22 but graduated at 25 with a bunch of guys who were mostly around the same age and the same situation and we‚Äôve been close for almost 12 years...I‚Äôd say focus on your mental and physical health. You are in the years of your life that can lay some serious foundation for the man you want to be. Nothing comes overnight but you are making steps in the right direction. Start making friends with people, even making small talk. That way you can build your confidence and become more social.
hodnvv,This story from my dad (from Ireland) always inspired me:When I got to Sweden I worked as a window washer, at 34 I realised that my body won't keep up with this as I get older. So I went to a guidance counsellor and asked for my options, if I first studied municipal adult education and then went to college I could become a teacher.When I told my co-workers this they said "Jesus Christ Kevin, you'll be 40 when you're done."I just said "Well, I'll be 40 either way."
hodnvv,When I was about 20, I was lost. I didn't know what to do with my life, I had a good paying job I was good at, but didn't enjoy. An older and much more experienced friend asked me after a party - what would I do if I win the lottery and didn't need to work for money?That question lingered in my head for years. I had no idea. I decided to do a bunch of things, work different jobs, take on any project at work that seemed interesting. Just follow my nose and hope I get lucky.It took me 10 years. I stumbled on a job where I was curious enough to spend my evenings learning about how to do things better. After a few years, I changed a few jobs in quick succession, trying to find the right specific company and job in the industry that would let me work to improve and appreciate what I did. Each was ok to a varying degree, but at 40, I decided the perfect environment is unlikely. You take the bad with the good.Now, I like where I am and I don't much care where I'm going. Time will tell, I know what I'm good at, other people know what I'm good at, and I enjoy what I do.
hodnvv,I know attractiveness DOES matter, but I want to say that I date men of all levels of attractiveness, but I will not date someone who is unhappy or depressed and not getting treatment. I have had to work so, so hard to be okay, and find my own happiness, and pull myself out of my own depression, that I can feel someone else's pulling me back.So your looks may have less to do with the women being uninterested than with your overall outlook on life and how you feel about who you are and what you can offer them.I know others have said it, but I think therapy could be something that helps you.(Also, 23 is so, so young. If, at 23, you have been able to find something to study that you love, and get a diploma, and have a good friend who cares about you, you're doing pretty well)
hodnvv,Only one woman your entire life has made you laugh? That seems strange, but glad you‚Äôre doing well!
hodnvv,This really stuck out to me as well. OP has made substantial improvements but if he keeps seeing women as such "others" and grading them against a feeemale only scale rather than as people, he is going to continue to struggle finding fulfilling romantic relationships.
hodnvv,Force √† toi mec, c'est un peu bateau, mais t'es ta propre limite. Taff √† fond mais oublie pas de te laisser le temps de profiter des trucs qui te bottent. Bon courage gros.
hodnvv,It sounds like you've got this, even if you don't know it. Keep pushing to do what you love and be proud of how far you have come.
hodnvv,Congrats for what you've already accomplished! You have so much more in front of you. And you have plenty of time to find a life partner..... I was 30 when I met my husband, and I was very single before then.
hodnvv,Your English has improved a lot. Congratulations on moving on. Keep it up!
hodnvv,Well Kudos to you! Keep pushing!
hodnvv,any improvement is improvement :-) keep it up!
hodnvv,Congratulations! Things take time. I got my license at 25. I haven't finished any formal qualifications. Everyone goes at their own pace. You're doing great :)There are also minimal typos in your post so, well done for your English skills too!
jet6a7,You're right OP...her reaction is so wildly illogical that I dont think she ever really was that into you. She probably was already teetering over an indecisive line and found a reason to say she isn't interested. Don't take it personal. You did nothing wrong
jet6a7,Im so confused who gets mad over that? like is this a thing? its a chipped tooth.
jet6a7,Agreed. My brother's dog literally ran into me and broke my foot and it took me 3 months to heal. I was initially upset but soon got over it because accidents happen. And my brother never even offered to pay for it like OP did!This reminds me of another unfortunate accident where I dropped my phone and broke it in a bus because my SO insisted on stopping at that stop (instead of the one we planned) and he failed to warn me that the bus stops abruptly (I had never rode a bus prior to this so I didn't know, whereas he rides them constantly). I was initially upset, mostly frustrated because I was in a foreign land and lost my main device for contacting family back home the night before I was due to fly home solo. Know what SO and I did? We tag teamed to find a solution, because that's what a couple does when a tough situation arises. I still feel awful I even got mad at him initially because it was truly an accident.OP, you dodged a bullet as this girl clearly wasn't as committed to the relationship as you were.
jet6a7,This! Her reaction is the most irrational thing I‚Äôve ever heard. She was likely already wanting to break up and used this as her excuse. I‚Äôm so sorry.
jet6a7,Because it wasn't the chipped tooth. He honestly sounds exhausting and she was probably looking for a reason to end it. He's 34 and wouldn't leave her tf alone when she asked for space. I thought I was reading posts by a teenager at first. We're only getting OP's side, and he honestly doesn't sound that great.
jet6a7,I wouldn't conclude that she was never that into you but she may have a mental health issue that makes her petty. By no fucking means is it an excuse (I've been on the receiving end twice from 2 female friends), but it allows me to understand what caused it, how much am I responsible and how much is their disproportionate reaction, then move on.
jet6a7,Definitely think she played the chipped tooth as her way out.
jet6a7,Seems like she was just looking for an out and the chipped tooth provided one. You guys are in different life stages by your ages, often times it‚Äôs harder to connect and communicate. Just keep swimming.
jet6a7,The amount of men on here, in general really, that are 8-20 years older than the women they are with is kinda telling.Imo what you say is so obvious so why is there a pattern of going after people so much younger? Sure, at a certain point it doesn't matter but with someone in their 20s it matters. Hell, it matters if you're 30/40 and your partner is a grandparent and or established in life.Even if you flip the sexes around it's a long shot because they aren't mentally or emotionally where you are because you have more life experiences no matter how one tries to explain it off.Seems like a waste of time in 9 out of 10 cases. Those I know who have done so it was really more about an ego boost and bragging how young the person is.
jet6a7,I don't think she was looking for an out. I think she was emotionally immature and didn't know how to deal with her emotions and felt that blaming someone for the accident made sense to her. Which caused her to think twice about the relationship.Emotional maturity (or lack thereof) is what I saw in the two posts.
jet6a7,My dating life got a lot easier when I decided to just stop pursuing people that didn't pursue me with the same fervor. If the person is telling you they don't know how they feel, or being indirect, why waste your time? You shouldn't have to convince someone to like you or to stay with you.  You're worth more than that.
jet6a7,The best piece of dating advice I've ever received is this:If they like you, you'll know. If they don't, you'll be confused. Always remember, someone's effort is a reflection of their interest in you.
jet6a7,I just read both posts. I agree with what others have said about her irrational and highly strung reaction, and that you need to remove yourself from this person asap.But what really struck me was something you said about meeting someone and putting all your energy into that person, being ghosted, etc. Am I right in saying that you get attached quickly?As well as removing yourself from this toxic woman, I'd suggest you try and address the issues underlying your own dating and relationship patterns. It seems like there might be some kind of attachment issue here, exacerbated by how you view yourself.Might I suggest that you take a break and focus on yourself for a while? Perhaps a period of therapy or counselling to help you understand yourself better?
jet6a7,Might I suggest that you take a break and focus on yourself for a while? Perhaps a period of therapy or counselling to help you understand yourself better?yesssssss. This.I have/had(she‚Äôs working on it lol) an anxious attachment style from a ‚Äúchaotic‚Äù childhood where my feelings were inconsistently (and hopefully inadvertently) invalidated by my ‚Äúcaretakers.‚Äù In addition to the inconsistency, my caretakers often made me feel responsible for satisfying their emotional needs (usually before my own). And this emotional martyrdom was romanticized growing up. And as an adult, I was in relationships that surprise! involved a lot of gaslighting and emotional manipulation (still not sure if it was on purpose or a result of their own trauma and unwillingness to be accountable). Basically, I ended up staying way too long with people that gave me mixed signals because the positive reinforcement felt so good!As I unpack all my different trauma boxes, I become a little more mindful of my feelings and actions‚Äîand dare I say that I actually LIKE myself (most of the time... We‚Äôre working on it. Lol)!But I wanted to say, HUGE RED FLAG from your last post (am I triggered? Lol):‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt good enough because she then proceeded to tell me that I had already ruined her mood by making her be mean and asking me not to go.‚ÄùThis is emotional manipulation 101. She is a grown woman in control of her own feelings and actions, and blaming you for making her the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù is a form of gaslighting.This ain‚Äôt it fam.OP, from the way you told it, it doesn‚Äôt seem like you did much wrong. Your ex could have communicated her needs better (‚ÄúCan you please leave the dogs outside while I collect myself.‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready to face you yet, can we coordinate it so that we are not at the party at the same time.‚Äù etc etc etc).
jet6a7,Also just based on experience, when you have either attachment or codependency issues, it can impair your judgement without you even realizing it.You‚Äôre so ready and needing to have that bond, that you overlook or don‚Äôt see the red flags that would normally stop things from getting serious in the first place.Definitely agree that OP might want to look into why they are in this pattern, and why they need a bunch of strangers to point out what over the top behavior this girl had.OP you will generally have happier, healthier and longer lasting relationships if you deal with your own issues before pursuing another partner.
jet6a7,I know you were replying to the OP but I felt like someone read a page of my diary here. I've been this person that gets attached to others very easily. But I don't get what you meant by "exacerbated by how you view yourself". I don't know why I get attached to people easily. Not only people but even places, things etc.
ik8t0r,Your mums don't sound mean, they sound like they love you. You're smart for listening to your doctor, it must really suck to not be able to skate if you love it but it's not worth the risk, especially since you're still healing. We all feel a bit invincible at 15 but don't push it, a lifetime in a wheelchair or worse isn't worth it. You sound like a sensible young man with great parents. I hope your recovery is swift and your strength returns.
ik8t0r,You said this much nicer than I would have, but I totally agree. Although I would add that I am annoyed that OP wanted to skate again too. But I remember what it is to be a teenager and feel invincible.OP, when a coworker of mine took up surfing and knocked out her two front teeth several of us on her team got together and got her a console and a surfing game. There is a remake of the classic Tony Hawk Pro Skater coming out in a few days, I would highly recommend you pick up a copy for your favorite game console and use that to get the skating urges out of your system. ;)
ik8t0r,Can we give OP a round of applause for talking to the doctor and getting advice? It isn't always easy to do, especially at that age.
ik8t0r,I fractured my neck when I was 16 sledding, and it‚Äôs been almost a decade later and I still have back and neck issues from it, neck and spine injuries are a big deal. I‚Äôm not saying you should never skate again, but for the next year at least you should be focusing on healing, another fall could seriously injure you more. I‚Äôd recommend talking to your parents more about it, you have to think about how scary it must have been for them as well. Maybe you can pick up skating again down the road, but you need to slow down for awhile and focus on recovery.
ik8t0r,Were you advised to avoid certain activities once you were healed?
ik8t0r,What team did you play for?
ik8t0r,Hello, former roller derby skater here. I know it's not the same as skateboarding but I just wanted to share my story to let you know you are not alone.I had a bad fall about 8 years ago during training and broke my leg. Now when I say I broke my leg, I really shattered it. 5 breaks in total, spiralling up around my leg. I had to have pretty serious surgery on it and get two plates put in, one of which runs from my ankle to my knee. It was horrible, and took nearly a year to get myself back walking properly again. And I still have a slight limp and lots of scars all these years later.My mother wasn't too keen on the idea of me returning to skate but as I was in my 20s she didn't really have any control over the situation. So I re joined a small local derby team and started skating again, because it was all I could think of as I lay there for months waiting for my leg to heal. I was desperate to get back skating. However, I found once I had strapped my skates on and started moving that I just didn't have the nerve for it anymore. Falling is a big part of any skating, and every time I slipped or stumbled I nearly vomited in terror, and all the memories of my leg break came flooding back.So I skated for a few weeks with the team but ultimately the fear only got worse the faster and more competent I became. So I quit, but it was my decision so I had no bitterness towards anyone. Sometimes you just have to be mature and tell yourself that regardless of how fun something is, it's not worth getting a life-changing injury. You sould like you're handling your situation very maturely, so fair play. Best of luck with your recovery, and I hope you find a new hobby that you love just as much as skating.
ik8t0r,I broke my C6 vertebra in a car accident, so I get the shock and awe of a new life post neck injury.  In my case, it was an undo burden to no longer drive - plus it‚Äôs still relatively a safe activity (so long as you don‚Äôt get run off a highway and flip your car on a cliff).However, my neurologist made it veeeeerrrryyyy clear that I was to not take unnecessary risk, like skiing, skateboarding, sky diving, or anything else that considered falling down at a fast pace or high altitude. I can‚Äôt even ride roller coasters anymore. It‚Äôs a total bummer as an adrenaline junkie. Thankfully, a lot of water activities are still on the table as ways to find adrenaline, exercise, or sport.Be warned, if don‚Äôt take your therapy seriously now and your neck heals weird, you‚Äôll at best be in pain all the time and get migraines and at worst need tons of surgeries. It‚Äôs not worth it when you‚Äôre 30 and feel 60 due to your neck/shoulder pain.
ik8t0r,I don't think any parent on this sub is going to think your parents sound mean. They are looking out for you because they care about you. Neck/spinal cord injuries are no joke. Even if you heal and gain full mobility you will most likely start feeling this injury again in about 10-20 years.I empathize though. You're being shut out from a passion of yours at a young age. But it is the smart move in the long run. The last thing you want is to be in a wheelchair peeing into a bag for the rest of your life.
ik8t0r,I used to stay out really late at night, hanging out with friends, girlfriend, etc. One night as I snuck in, my dad was sitting up reading a book. Scared the hell out of me, and I thought I was done for. All he said was, "Your mom and I never really sleep until you come home. And when you're really late, we're always afraid that the car pulling in is the police, coming to tell us something horrible has happened."When your parents love you, that fear of losing you is always there, in the back of their minds.
ik8t0r,Just remember, the vast majority of your life will be spent NOT being a teenager. So don't fuck your body up now, you'll have to live with it for a long time
ik8t0r,As a mum my self and a once stupid teenager who took a fall from a horse they are not being mean and as a mum of an idiot teenage boy who spent most of his time from 14 to 17 in various different leg casts arm cast and leg braces and crutches not from a dangerous sport he fell off an inflatable and injured himself doing nothing most of the time don‚Äôt do anything till you have healed properly take all the physio you can and if medical professionals tell you doing something is not a good idea listen to them I‚Äôm nearly 40 I need a hip replacement that I‚Äôm not going to get any time soon because I‚Äôm not old enough because I was stupid and thought I knew better at 16 when it‚Äôs cold wet and damp I can hardly move pls make sure you heal properly before you attempt anything
ik8t0r,It wasn't a neck injury and skateboarding for me, it was back injury and football. I decided to keep n playing after my first surgery, and ended up needing another surgery after getting injured again in college.Although I look back at those times fondly, I am in constant and unrelenting pain. Having a chronic injury sucks, but if its in you spinal column its so much worse.Please take care of yourself, being in constant pain really takes a toll.
ik8t0r,You're being very sensible. I can tell you love skating. I'm really sorry this happened to you and that you've had to give up something you love to do. However, I can completely understand your parents point of view. If you ever have a kid yourself in the future, I think you will understand even more - it hurts at an incredible level to see your own child in pain and I really believe they just want you to be safe... they're in no way doing this to be "mean". Please do give yourself some time to grieve the loss of your hobby and I truly hope you can find another outlet that you will love as much. I hope your neck heals well OP.
ik8t0r,I‚Äôd toss your skateboard too,  no offense. Your moms are looking out for you and are rightly worried about your health.
ik8t0r,Good. If my kid broke his neck doing something he'd never be doing that something again if I had say in it, and under 18 they do have a say.
ik8t0r,Friend of mine broke their neck skiing, she was mad that she broke it at the beginning of the season, not the end.Everyone told her to never ski again.... the day she was able, she was on skis.
ik8t0r,As it‚Äôs a parent‚Äôs favourite phrase.... ‚Äúyou‚Äôll break your neck‚Äù..... since you actually did break your neck, I can understand why you‚Äôre parents are hesitant or even forbidding you skate boarding again....
ik8t0r,I dated a guy who was a near professional snowboarder. He was being vetted at 15 for big deals and major companies would come out and watch him shred in competitions. He fell and had a major spinal injury and the doctors were pretty blunt: this can‚Äôt happen again if you want to not be a paraplegic. It‚Äôs tough but your mamas are just looking out for your later quality of life!
ik8t0r,There's a saying that when one person tells you that you're drunk but you don't feel like it, then you can probably ignore them. But when 10 people tell you that you're drunk, maybe it's time to sit down.No, your mom isn't mean. Welcome to the cusp of adulthood. Your actions have consequences. By your own account, you did something stupid that led to you breaking your neck. The repercussions of that choice are that you should not ever get on a skateboard again. In fact, a lot of sports and other active hobbies are going to be out of your reach from now on. It doesn't mean that you can't live a fulfilling life.However, you need to realize that the risk centers in your brain aren't fully developed, and won't be for over 10 years. So if you have any inkling to do something dangerous or risky, you need to learn to help your brain understand the risk. Go the other way. You BROKE YOUR NECK. Understand the severity of your issue. Listen to your doctor, because he probably spent about as long in college, medical school and residency as you have been alive.Going to skate was COLOSSALLY irresponsible. You really need to unpack this and get your head on straight.
ik8t0r,Good choice, prioritize your health and recovery. Maybe in a few years the doc will give you the ok to start skating again
kyqjar,Isn‚Äôt it a bit insulting to you that for 25 years he‚Äôs acted the way he has and only now he ‚Äúwants to try‚Äù counseling? Like why weren‚Äôt you worth that before?  You know why? He‚Äôs manipulating you into not leaving.
kyqjar,I feel like he‚Äôs doing it out of fear she‚Äôll leave now the youngest has left home. So, it‚Äôs not genuine interest in self improvement, just a reaction to one of his toys wanting to leave the game.
kyqjar,Yeah, I do see that. There are two things that are nagging at me. Deep down I want him to go to counseling in hopes that he would finally see his behavior for what it is. The other thing is that he's not all bad. He funny and loyal and hardworking and he is still my family.
kyqjar,Also isn't it advised against to go counseling w abusive partner, cuz they further manipulate into not leaving
kyqjar,This 100 percent. He knew that the kids were probably the glue. I wouldn't be surprised if he's just doing this in hope you won't leave him and take his precious money. Fuck your husband. Leave and go be happy.
kyqjar,Plus in counselling,  she might say things he will use against her to manipulate her more.
kyqjar,OP, your soon to be ex husband missed the chance to possibly save his marriage. It‚Äôs too late. Maybe he can get individual counseling and experience a little personal growth but I think you deserve freedom, happiness and maybe a relationship with a man who‚Äôs already not an abusive and controlling twat. Time to move on.
kyqjar,Lol, I don't disagree but if we do separate the last thing on my agenda will be another man... at least for awhile.
kyqjar,He‚Äôs abusive. He‚Äôs done more damage to the children by continuing to expose them to abuse than any divorce would have hurt them. Leave him and don‚Äôt try counseling.
kyqjar,Yeah genuinely don‚Äôt know why she would stay with him. My dad is exactly like this man and the relief I would get when my mum would balls up and leave him with me, the relief and small amount of happiness I would get! Until she would go back to him.Never stay in a shitty relationship for the kids. Bet her kids aren‚Äôt going to be thanking her in the future for staying with a scumbag because I sure don‚Äôt.
kyqjar,Yea, she says they're "well-adjusted" but coming from abuse like that, where the abuser made them break down multiple times throughout their lives doesn't make well-adjusted adults. Those poor kids will one day realize just how shitty it was for their mother to stay with/force them to live with their abuser if they don't already.
kyqjar,My mother was good, but the very best thing she did for me was divorce my father when I was four. Sure, I had to stay with him alone 4-6 days a month for well over a decade, and yes, that was absolutely mentally damaging -- but I still had one setting in which I felt safe and loved and sane. I would not be a healthier person if she'd stayed and attempted to shield me from his abuse, because that would just not have been possible; having to watch and listen to the abuse of another person is also abuse.
kyqjar,Yeah, just go ahead and get the fuck out. The fact that he's good and funny sometimes doesn't make a difference - that's true of many abusive people.It's just a shame that you stayed in this shitty-ass marriage for the entire time that your kids were growing up, when you could've done otherwise. Great example there, showing them what marriage is. I'm glad they seem great and smart and whatever, but you didn't do them favors. They saw how he treated you, and they learned that if that happens in marriage, you stick around for decades of misery.
kyqjar,I was going to say that too, but then they would have had to suffer his abuse alone when it was his visitation time. At least she stayed to be a buffer for her kids against her husbands behavior. Well.. or she tried to be anyway.
kyqjar,Don‚Äôt do counselling with an abuser or they‚Äôll just have more to fire up their abuse with.
kyqjar,THIS! If my parents split when they should have when my sisters and I were kids we would all have been better off.
kyqjar,I know you made "think" your children are well adjusted but I guarantee you they carry the scars of abuse and growing up watching you being abused. My mom was with a man who was verbally and emotionally abusive for a couple years. Even though it was only a "short" time and she was always independent and successful (she received her master's while working and raising me alone) excluding this time period, I am still affected today. The things he said to us replay in my head regularly, I have dreams he's going to find us again. Your focus should be on your children and helping them navigate through the trauma and hurt. Even though I turned out okay there was a lot of self destruction that took place out of anger towards my mother. It was hard trying to forgive her for allowing this man in our lives over and over.
ktz21o,I think you might need to like, warn your friends about this. Tell them that your mom is kinda overbearing and that if she somehow finds their number, they should block her. And then I think you have to have a talk with your mom about how, if she wants to have a relationship with you she needs to stop doing things that make you want to get away from her.
ktz21o,Agreed. Just notify your friends and apologize in advance but if she reaches out to them then tell them to feel free to block.   If I was your friend I feel that would be the best way to handle
ktz21o,I‚Äôm honestly surprised so many estranged friends would tolerate this. Like it‚Äôs so easy to block unwanted messages
ktz21o,I would just warn them to block her if they want, but on the second half, I wouldn't talk to her at all about it.  A leopard doesn't change its spots.  She would just make him feel guilty or ask him what he had to hide.  She'd game him for sure.
ktz21o,My mom never texted or call my friends but whenever we had a fight she threatened to call my friends and i was soo weirded out, i deleted all my friends number from her phone even before it happened. Fast forward in college i make a mistake and give bffs no. To her for emergencies cuz we're going to out of state trip , i missed her calls ,my mom blew up friends phone asking where tf i was and why wasn't i picking up and since i wasn't w my frnd she didn't know what to say and mom just berated soo badly made my frnd cry. To say never gave anyones no. Again and made all of em block her.Now why didn't op make  friends/gf block her the first time it happened. Why let it happen for soo long
ktz21o,maybe it'd be helpful for OP block the mom for them, and tell the mom so she knows that OP did it and not the friends. so that OP can be the one who draws the line and the friends don't have to be worried about offending a friend's mom
ktz21o,Also lock your social media down. Don't have her as a friend and set everything to private
ktz21o,My brother's fianc√©e's mom contacted me (and not any of their friends) last month to know what gift suggestions I had. Haven't spoken with her since, this is definitely excessive and not normal
ktz21o,Wow! I am 55 yr old mom of a 21 year old son who lives/studies overseas. I cringed when reading this. Cant blame covid. She has been doing it for years. I would NEVER, EVER contact my son's friends or gf outside of an emergency. He would never put up with it either. She has to be told that this will ruin your relationship and is destroying your friendships.   Have one zoom session together with the therapist and you could both explain this situation and that should put an end to it immediately. No therapist would condone app behaviour. I'm sorry she's doing this to you it is completely out of line.
ktz21o,I‚Äôve never thought about going to a therapist for one quick problem. I‚Äôve always had mine long term, do they do that?? If so that‚Äôs pretty awesome.
ktz21o,I would give your friends a heads up first before having a serious talk with your mom so she doesn't turnaround and play the victim card to your friends.My roommate's fresh new girlfriend of less than 1 month started doing this to me and when my roommate expressed discomfort she reached out to me immediately and played the whole "why did you complain, you could have said so to my face, I thought we were friends" nonsense... it was really cringe.
ktz21o,My mom (55f) tries to get me to tell her all my friend's phone numbers and addresses. Nope. Not happening. If there is an emergency, my ICE contacts can be found in my phone, even when the phone is locked. (And oddly enough, my mom is listed last in those 4 contacts.) If an emergency happens while I'm with my mom, why would she need to notify my friends?  I'll update my friends when the emergency is over, or they'll figure out I'm dead via social media posts from family.
ktz21o,This is a great suggestion, OP should definitely get a 3rd party involved i.e. a therapist.Your Mum sounds lonely, needs her own friends but in the short term you should tell your friends and girlfriend to block her on everything, as should you. Set all of your social media to private also
ktz21o,This mom is definitely way over the line, but I don't think you have to restrict contact to just for emergencies. It's quite common for SOs and parents to be casual friends.
ktz21o,Cut. This. Shit. Out. Now. My mom did this when i was in college and it's incredibly invasive. She'd mine for information from my friends and use it against me later. I'm in my 40's now and I'm still experiencing fallout from my mom knowing what I was doing and spreading it around my very conservative family.
kue9rm,I read a similar story on here a few years ago and the girlfriend/wife had good success with asking her husband to just track his hours, everything he did. Then rank his priorities in life and compare how he spent his time to his priorities. He would tell her she was his priority but she was able to demonstrate that is not where he was prioritizing his time.IDK. My husband went through a phase where gaming was a problem, but it was that, and directly related to his mental health.Aside from making it extremely clear that he is prioritizing a digital life over his irl wife and that you are being negatively affected by his gaming and are not going to stick around for that forever or subject kids/dogs whatever to it. And that playing an hour or two at night and a couple hours on the weekend are fine but what he's doing is unhealthy for everyone including himself, there's not much you can do. It really is similar to dealing with an addict. You have to decide what your boundaries are and stick to them.ETA: also. You are not obligated to try to fix him or try to solve this problem. This is a problem of his creation. If he does nothing and you leave you should not feel guilty. You deserve to be treated well in a relationship, and not expected to sit on a shelf until your partner is ready to play with you. You are a whole person with needs and wants and it is a good thing to know that and fight for it
kue9rm,I had an issue with a certain activity being a time-suck to the point where it negatively affected our relationship and ability to maintain our household well, and we did something like what you're suggesting. Sat down and plotted out the week to see where the time was going. Turns out, the thing one of us thought of as "just this casual thing we do once a week" took up about 11 hours of our day, on  the ONLY day neither of us worked. So we were essentially choosing to have a 6-day week by cutting out the day best suited for working on big things around the house and spending time together as a couple. Like no shit it felt like we could never catch up on anything! It was pretty easy to argue that the constant stress caused by losing an entire day each week was not worth the enjoyment we got from that activity. Ended up cutting it down and everything improved a lot.There are for sure ways to automatically track how much time is spent in a game or on a console. Track the gaming time for a week, estimate in sleep hygiene eating etc time, and see how much is actually left for doing anything else.
kue9rm,It really is similar to dealing with an addictIt‚Äôs not similar; it is dealing with an addict. Gaming can be addiction just like coke can be, even though it affects your body in a different way. Also, OP‚Äôs husband thinks that OP is controlling for asking him to stop, which I think is a clear symptom of addiction.
kue9rm,Great suggestion. Visual representation might help it click how much he spends gaming. My husband and I just argued a lot until he somehow was convinced.Its important to think of the future. My friends husband also played this much. When they had a child the amount of gaming didn't change. He barely helped out at all. She was worried to leave her with him because he'd ignore the kid while playing.Their marriage didn't work out.
kue9rm,I'm usually pretty uppity with the exactitude of the comments and the points I Want to make here, but there's really nothing I can add to this one.OP says she's spent 2 years living like this, and that everytime she's tried to address it, it a) becomes a fight (meaning the husband won't even discuss the problem), and b) the husband has already been pretty clear that limiting his game timei is something he is not willing to do (via a passive aggressive threat of never being happy again).So I guess OP has her answer, and all she's got to decide is the date at which point she will decide to take the next step.
kue9rm,I think this is a good idea. Sitting him down and make him see the severity of the problem "If you refuse to talk about this calmly then I will leave and go to my parents" or something. Show him the actual breakdown of his time, show him yours. Show how much time you spend doing his share (eg. 3 hours of this that is his share of chores) and tell him clearly how much it hurts that you never go to bed together. Suggest that maybe one or two days off he can play, but at the same time you will be pursuing your hobbies and neither of you will be doing chores in that time. And once the time ends, that's it. He can play an hour or two every evening, but he's should make an attempt to fix his sleep schedule and help with the house and with meals etc. If he doesn't, lay down consequences, and follow through with them
kue9rm,Can you expand more on how you and your husband handled/resolved the gaming problem? My (very) long term boyfriend is addicted to video games. Plays 10 hours a day or so, and watches stream late into the night. None of my attempts to talk to him about it has made any difference. I‚Äôve tried everything; being supportive (I‚Äôm certain his addiction is directly tied to his mental health- he struggles with depression and is on medication for it), giving him tough love, even being mean. Nothing works. I‚Äôve posted here, but have only ever been told to leave him. I know the addiction is controlling him and it isn‚Äôt done out of malice. Any advice?
kue9rm,That first part reminds me of a part of that doco The Social Dilemma. One of the people being interviewed said he didn‚Äôt limit the time his children spent on social media, they chose to do it themselves. He asked the kids what they thought was a reasonable amount of time to spent on social media per day, and they stuck to it.Maybe something like that would work? Could be a way of approaching it without being the one to enforce hours
kue9rm,Two other suggestions: couples counseling and the book Fair Play.I‚Äôd suggest couples counseling before you ask for him to track time or do the chore distribution in the Fair Play book.
kue9rm,I think this is the best approach.
kue9rm,the mental health thing is what i would be worried about, tbh. I wonder if he's miserable at his job, if he suffers from depression, or if there's other underlying problems. A lot of people use gaming as an escape when they're suffering in the real world.
kue9rm,Great idea, hope it works for OP. I'm in a similar situation but foresee my bf saying its too much of an effort to keep track or that I am being controlling again cause I ask him to do that. Moreover he might feel like I tell him what to do which he hates coming from anyone, not just me. Funny coincidence, my bf is also 32. It's definitely worth a try though. Especially if this has been going on for so long. Way too long.
kue9rm,Just tag on to this, because it's great advice!Another method is to respect his ability to manage his time, but together write out the expectations you have for the relationship and allow him to manage when and how he meets them. For example sit down and discuss the chores that need to be done in the house. Have an equitable split of that work and write out the frequency it needs to be done. Don't tell him when to do it or that he has to limit his gaming, just that these are his responsibility to accomplish however he sees fit. If that results in having to limit his game time, then that's his decision on time management, it's not OP controlling him.Also express the minimum amount of time you expect to be invested in The relationship.  Time to just be together talking watching tv, going for a walk, etc. Whatever the activities are. Then let him contribute to when they happen.
kue9rm,You know, I would 100% agree that a lot of people use gaming as an output when their mental health isn‚Äôt great.I can speak from experience that when I‚Äôm not in the best of mental health I put way more time into gaming. It‚Äôs something where I can just sit and all the stress of life goes away. Especially if you‚Äôre gaming with old friends or some buddies you can just sit down and hang out and shoot the shit with your friends and before you know it, five or six hours has passed. But at the same time, it‚Äôs five or six hours where you don‚Äôt feel like a worthless sack of shit.
kue9rm,As somebody that has actually gotten therapy for addiction over gaming, I‚Äôd like to chime in that mental health can be a large reason for it.  Gaming is a form of escapism.  And because of that, it can turn into a vice.I still game, but far more reasonable now, and I try to put other things ahead of it.  That said, when stress gets high or I‚Äôm just not having a good week, I‚Äôve noticed my time in a chair increases pretty dramatically.  If it‚Äôs not something you‚Äôre watching out for, it can cause a lot of problems
kue9rm,It's an excellent idea, but she mentioned that she's tried all these other approaches, and husband won't budge.I really like what you said at the end there- OP, you are worth so much more than being a roy on a shelf, right?There are millions of people out there that don't have their heads lodged so far up their own asses. He's escalating this I to a fight when you just bring it up. Is this how you want to live? Walking on eggshells, wishing for your old relationship? Cooking and cleaning up after 2 whole ass adults, with no help, for the rest of your life?Maybe leaving will help him realize that he has a serious problem. But it won't be your problem any more.
kue9rm,Having a hobby is fine. Having an addiction is not. A hobby becomes an addiction when it takes over his life and he refuses to see the damage it‚Äôs doing to his relationship and the pain it‚Äôs causing you.Like any addict he‚Äôs unlikely to stop until he recognises the problem and wants to stop - and he‚Äôs unlikely to recognise the problem until he hits rock bottom or is shocked out of it.
kzmpla,If he doesn't want to accept a gift, he could accept a loan; it's better to be indebted to relatives than to some bank, so maybe you could convince him to accept the money as a loan, write up paperwork between him and his parents to indicate this is a loan, and he'll pay it back when he gets a job etc.
kzmpla,Excellent suggestion
kzmpla,this is what my brother did. My dad helped him with the cash to buy a business. My brother paid him back every month for two years with the profits of the business (no interest). Much better than a bank loan with interestEDIT: It also helps a lot because if the business struggled, they could have renegotiated the length of payback without my brother feeling the pressure of a bank coming after his assets. My parents are retired and could happily live off a lower income. It didn't turn out that way (the business was and is doing well) but the pressure of paying back my dad is surely less than a bank breathing down his neck
kzmpla,Yes I agree 100% write up paperwork and pay his parents back. Tell him you will help as well even if you don‚Äôt have a job at the moment it could ease the stress he is under. I understand not wanting parents money. I don‚Äôt know there relationship but some people like to throw things like that in your face when arguing or in front of people to embarrass you so I can understand from that point of view. But like I said I don‚Äôt know their relationship
kzmpla,So, much THIS, OP!!!!I got into a rough patch and accepted money from my mom (my father is deceased) with the condition that if I had not paid it all back when she died, that it would be taken out of my inheritance.  She had the money and I knew that it was not going to put her in a difficult situation, so we had it written up.  I have paid most of it back now, but if anything still exists when she dies, my oldest sister (executor) knows it comes off the top of what I get.  I feel fine with that.
kzmpla,I came here to say this. I had an okay - but very old car - and my grandmother decided to sell her (much newer) car. They called me and said they would be buying the car with cash and I would take out a loan with them interest free. I couldn‚Äôt have afforded a car note at that time since I had just gotten divorced. Then covid hit and I lost my job. They allowed me to defer payments until I found a job. I just made my first payment a couple days ago after a 8 month hiatus. There is no shame in accepting help but framing it as a loan helped me save face with my parents.We drafted a document and each payment is logged by myself and my mother separately to ensure we are all on the same page on the status of the loan.
kzmpla,This. I got mad respect for your husband. Firstly, I'd ask him, "Do you love your son? Do you love him enough to put aside your own pride and ego to get him the help he needs?" If that doesn't work, "Fine, let's get a loan at the best rate we can. Look at that, your folks have the best available loan option" Good luck, OP!
kzmpla,Hard facts, if he was to get a job next week on X salary how long would it take to clear the debt? Especially if your child‚Äôs medical condition will keep costing you.Would he agree to a loan from his parents?
kzmpla,A loan would be a good idea but even then I have a feeling he wouldnt take it.I also like your idea of doing the math and I think maybe laying out all of the finances and saying by X date(when things become untenable) that she will take the loan if he cant figure it out by then.I also wonder if OP cant get another job as people are hiring again in a lot of places so it may be worth it since the husband is also home to take care of the kid that she find another job if he isnt able too. Even if its also with taking the loan so there is some cushion to right the finances.
kzmpla,You mange the finances. Sit him down and show him the bills. Ask him what his solution is. Since you manage the finances, I feel you get the final say.Some solutions I can think off:The money is strictly for your kid. Maybe that way he can put down his prideConsider a loan instead of a gift.Get a job from his parents. I assume his parents have some work that need his help.He doesn't sound like a bad person, just too prideful and refusing to accept reality.
kzmpla,These are a good start but if he isn‚Äôt going to agree then I don‚Äôt see why she can‚Äôt override his decision and take the money as a loan with the expectation of repayment.They risk losing their house, impacting their credit rating and are risking the health of their young son.Why is his decision final?
kzmpla,Fourth option. Can you go back to work and let your husband look after your child?
kzmpla,Yeah, i was also thinking that he might be more likely to accept money if they only let the grandparents directly help with their kid.  Hopefully he can see the reason there, even if he'd rather drop dead than let them spend a penny on himself
kzmpla,Excellent Suggestions
kzmpla,Since you manage the finances, I feel you get the final say.I agree with everything you said except this.The person who manages the finances doesn't somehow get more power in a relationship. This makes no sense.
o32tvx,When my boyfriend was growing out his hair (to the point that he looked like Jim Henson by the end of Quarantine), we had a similar problem. I just straight up said "you need to use shampoo and conditioner, not soap. Soap will leave your hair full of residue. Shampoo and conditioner will make it feel like mine." And if his hair looks greasy, I was directly say "babe i think you should probably wash your hair". I feel like if you have a level of intimacy that you're married, you can be honest with him and be like "hey your hair is dirty, lets fix it" .Once you've got him to properly clean it, then you can work on the styling. Maybe ask him to wear it down for sexy times? So he will associate that that hairstyle is something you really like and may be more motivated to try it out.You gotta be prepared for the possibility that he just prefers the high ponytail, though. That could be his version of a woman's messy bun and I'd roll my eyes so hard if my boyfriend told me he wanted me to stop wearing my messy buns when I'm just hanging out in sweats because it's not attractive to him (this is separate from the hygiene thing of course). If that's the case, buy him his own brush and scrunchies, and present the scrunchies like a joke ("hey since you like mine so much, here are some that will go better with your hair color") and try to find some good hearted humor in his look.
o32tvx,This is great advice
o32tvx,This should be the top comment. Aside from hygiene which is totally fair and should be addressed, just because you don‚Äôt like seeing his hair in a high pony doesn‚Äôt mean he has to stop wearing his hair a certain way when he‚Äôs chilling at home.Totally fair on the hairbrush/accessories thought. My partner and I have separate hair brushes because he uses product in his hair and if I share a brush with him the residue leaves my hair oily if i use the same hairbrush. Just get him his own stuff.
o32tvx,I love the suggestion of associating styles you like with sexiness and creating motivation for him to wear it like that more often.I‚Äôm a woman and I hate wearing my hair up because as a kid, other kids used to make fun of my ears and how big and red they were. So I got used to wearing my hair down and keeping it long to hide my ears and avoid the insults.My boyfriend loves when I put my hair up. He often requests that I do it during sex (partially for convenience but also because he finds it hot) and I‚Äôm always happy to when it‚Äôs just us two alone in the bedroom. Since I‚Äôve been with him, I‚Äôve found that I do occasionally want to put my hair up when we go out in public and he always gets really touchy and lovey with me when I do that so it motivates me to do it more and to experiment more often with different hair styles. I love how he‚Äôs helped me override the bad memories associated with up-dos to the point where I now feel confident, beautiful, and sexy when I wear my hair like that.
o32tvx,I‚Äôd just like to say that this is great advice, but also- high ponytails cause breakage. Buns on top of the head, or low ponytails are a bit less damaging styles.OP- Maybe you can explain to him that low ponytails/man buns are better for his hair?
o32tvx,I also feel the need to point out 5 day old hair ISNT super dirty like she‚Äôs implying. There are millions of ethnic women who was their hair 1-2 times a week as well as that‚Äôs what‚Äôs good for their hair. I myself wash my hair 2-3 times a week at most due to my hair type and her acting as though it‚Äôs disgusting is... well, disgusting.
o32tvx,This! There is the possibility he doesn‚Äôt like washing his long hair and the drying process? Especially if he has a real thick head of hair.Also finding it not attractive when he‚Äôs just relaxing seems a little unfair, if he‚Äôs relaxing that‚Äôs kind of the point but I agree with just getting him his own, maybe even get some matching ones or just be cute with it!
o32tvx,I agree with this. I‚Äôm an active guy that takes care of myself HOWEVER my girlfriend will straight up look at me and smell my hair and then tell me to go wash it lol. I don‚Äôt take offense at all.
o32tvx,Maybe some more attractive scrunchies? Hemp rope or leather straps? :D
o32tvx,I guess you could just randomly dump some shampoo on his head, which would force him to then go and rinse it out.Or, you know, you could just be direct. "Babe, I love you, but your hair is nasty and it's not attractive when you don't wash it for a week and I'm going to have to burn all my hair ties."
o32tvx,‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm going to have to burn all my hair ties‚Äù this made more air come out of my nose than usual üò≠
o32tvx,Husband I can see your hair is getting greasy, I think you need to wash it.  Am I the only one married that can say exactly what I need to say without my husband getting upset and offended?I often run and when I get home I will start to work around the house.  My husband will let me know lovingly that I smell of bo from the run, so I take a shower.  I'm not offended by this either.  I'm actually grateful he points it out before I go into public.
o32tvx,I‚Äôd go with this approach and maybe add a bit more love at the beginning and end for a love sandwich. ‚ÄúBabe I love you and I think you‚Äôre so sexy. But if you‚Äôre going have long hair - when it‚Äôs not clean and up in one of my scrunchies it doesn‚Äôt look or feel sexy to touch at all. If you want to keep it long I got you these hair ties for you to use. I know long hair needs more attention than you are used to. But if you don‚Äôt want to do that work it might be time to try a shorter and lower maintenance style. I really want to run my fingers through your hair again!‚Äù
o32tvx,I guess you could just randomly dump some shampoo on his head, which would force him to then go and rinse it out.Also he would probably get the hint after 2 or 3 or 27 times she does that.
o32tvx,This. If he cares he‚Äôll do something about it. It‚Äôs so easy to reason with ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt get to tell me what to do‚Äô but I think when you‚Äôre in a relationship, it‚Äôs a partnership, you‚Äôd have to be willing to compromise or at least meet in the middle.
o32tvx,Exactly, not sure why this isn‚Äôt higher.‚Äúthe little hints I‚Äôve been dropping like showing him how to take care of his hair have not been working‚ÄùMen are dense. It took a long time for my wife to move past passive aggressiveness and into direct words. I would never pick up on her hints. Direct is the way to go, especially if it‚Äôs as overt as nasty, greasy hair.
nxpoo5,Look at all that growth. You wear it wellü•Ç
nxpoo5,You may still benefit from therapy. If your mental health dips that low again, please don't hesitate. Pushing things down and not dealing with them (not that you aren't) can make them recur. It can definitely be a vicious cycle. Glad to hear you're doing so much better! :)
nxpoo5,I absolutely agree, thank you :)
nxpoo5,I have about 20 years of repressed feelings bucking up right now, and oof is this true.
nxpoo5,I agree!  I also think that everyone can benefit from having a good therapist at some point.   You don‚Äôt have to have a personality disorder, addiction or abuse in your life to benefit from it.   Sure , there are times you don‚Äôt need it but when you do, it‚Äôs nice to have someone to go to that can help you see things more clearly.
nxpoo5,What a wholesome update! Glad to hear that the both of you found the help you need and deserve :)
nxpoo5,So glad you have been so courageous!!! You have built a better, happier, healthier life!!!
nxpoo5,That's really good! I was actually in a similar situation, my exgf at the time had really bad reactions for me going out with friends. She was always really apologetic and I decided to power through.I shouldn't have. She ended up breaking up with me for other reasons... reasons I feel now happened cause I couldn't be my best self because of all the problems that insecurity caused me.You did the right thing, and it's really good to see you both doing well.For anyone out there that is reading this: put yourself first. Don't suffer for others, it's not worth it.
nxpoo5,Congratulations on putting yourself first. Sometimes people need a jolt to get therapy. While you mention not getting help yourself don't discount it completely . Having a non- judgemental person just listen can be helpful. Good luck
nxpoo5,I glad you ended it. He needed help and it could have been a very toxic relationship if it had carried on.I'm glad you've had the space to grown and learn. Very pleased your ex has sort out treatment. Good luck with you future
nxpoo5,I'm curious if he, before you broke up,  tried therapy to try and make the relationship work? Also congratulations for making the tough but necessary decision to move you life forward in a positive way.
nxpoo5,He never tried to get help before the break up- it was a few months into the break up when we talked and he finally decided to reach out for help. I finally realized that he wouldn‚Äôt and couldn‚Äôt reach out if I was being his pillow and emotional support so I left. Plus, it became draining and toxic for me.But yes, we‚Äôre both doing so much better now. Thank you :)
nxpoo5,Awesome. When you said he wanted you to not go out as much, and keep him updated when you did, that was a pretty big sign his anxiety was coming from insecurity that you weren‚Äôt being faithful to him. Someone who‚Äôs that insecure needs to work on themselves before having a relationship. If you‚Äôd stuck it out he very well could‚Äôve turned controlling and abusive.Edit: he already was controlling and abusive, just not in a dangerous way.
nxpoo5,Congrats, Op! It sounds like you‚Äôve learned a lot and you absolutely made the right choice. You truly helped not just yourself, but also your ex by letting him know his actions weren‚Äôt sustainable to your relationship. Sending good vibes your way!
nxpoo5,I'm so glad to hear this üåªüåª
nxpoo5,Congratulations! So glad to hear that!
nxpoo5,You didn't reply to anyone.
nxpoo5,quite honestly at this point i‚Äôm not sure, haha. we are respectful towards one another, but that‚Äôs not the word i was going for. still second guessing whether or not ‚Äúrespectively‚Äù works here or not though.
nxpoo5,No it s respectively in the way of : He is still my friend, and i am still his friendAnd not only her seeing him as a friend but doesnt know if he feels the same.
nxpoo5,Nothing ever happened, he just had a lot of insecurities and past trauma that led to irrational fears. It wasnt that he thought I would cheat but more the fear of losing me.EDIT: also, original post is linked at the very bottom of this one :)
i8uxei,Those 'friends' who cut you out without hearing your side were never good people begin with.  Breakups are always hard but it does get easier and soon you'll find yourself stress-free from all the BS that came with having an idiot bf.Spend this time to love yourself and realise how amazing you are.
i8uxei,Exactly! He probably wanted to save face and said things about you ‚Äúbeing controlling‚Äù or ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù or something to justify why he broke up with you.However those ‚Äúfriends‚Äù that instantly believed whatever he said about you are not friends you want to keep around.If someone said something nasty about my friends I‚Äôd immediately call them out on it and bring it to my friends attention. I‚Äôd never believe without confirmation.
i8uxei,This a million times! It's really hard to lose friends for whatever reason but they are crappy people. They know he cheated which means he's a liar so whatever bs he's said about you they should know is lies.
i8uxei,I would also add that as you get older, you care less about what other people think. You shouldn't waste your time worrying about them because as noted, they weren't worth your time anyway.
i8uxei,That and anyone with half a brain know what someone who instantly jumps into the next relationship has been doing.
i8uxei,One-day you'll find someone who loves you all if you and you'll look back laugh about this then never think of it again. It might be hard now but it'll get easier, he's 32 and acts like a 17 year old ...
i8uxei,I second this. People like him usually end up in dysfunctional situations and/or alone indefinitely.
i8uxei,He‚Äôs clearly taking advantage of you. I hope you get through this and find happiness. ‚úåüèº
i8uxei,Him being an ass has nothing to do with you or your worth. Perhaps consider some counseling to help work on your self esteem. It can be helpful to have someone to talk to about those things.And there is no shade here, but please be extremely careful in the future about dating someone that much older than you until you‚Äôre at least in your late 20s. Even then, proceed with caution. While not everyone in their 30s dating a decade+ younger is an abuser or a creep that is taking advantage of someone with less life experience and more patience for B.S., enough are that it‚Äôs worth keeping your eye out for.I‚Äôm sorry that things worked out this way, but I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve seen his true colors and dumped him without wasting any more time on a cheater. I hope you enjoy all the happiness in the world in the future.
i8uxei,Wow it's good that you threw out the whole man! You should be proud that you came out the other end of a shitty shitty relationship and that Jolene can continue dating a cheater. I went through a particularly crap break up which inevitably caused some division in my friend group (albeit not incredibly dramatic) but what made all the difference were the people I had as my support. I really relied on my closest friends/family in the months following the break up and I think that's what you need. People who cant see what he did was clearly wrong dont deserve your time and honestly blocking people online can really help you in terms of moving on (I did this myself 10/10 would recommend). Basically now it's time for you to look after yourself! You are worthy of love and you deserve everything! Take yourself on a nice date, buy yourself flowers, go out into nature, get involved in hobbies. You're living life without a dead weight on you anymore which makes you free to do whatever you want! Xx
i8uxei,This is terrible. He sounds like a total loser. Hope you are alright.
i8uxei,32 year old dating a 21 year old is 100% a loser
i8uxei,Yeah. People want to pretend a gap like this is fine but even as a 26 year old, I struggle to find 23 year olds romantically attractive because we are at such different live stages.Girl, you‚Äôre 21. Get some hot action while you can tbh.
i8uxei,I completely agree. Girl you‚Äôre 21!! You still have so much time left to find ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù Not trying to sound harsh, but I don‚Äôt understand how a 32 year old even wanted to date a person 11 years younger. Most people at this age are literally still in college (I‚Äôm 21 as well) or just got started on their career choice. When I was 20, a 27 year old graduate student tried flirting with me, and even with a 7 year gap it felt weird. Not only that, but he treated you like shit. You deserve much better.
i8uxei,(32 / 2) + 7 = 23. Yuup
i8uxei,I always operated with the understanding peoples‚Äô brains don‚Äôt stop developing until their mid twenties. Yesterday, an RN and Psychology Grad each told me that this is true of women‚Äôs brains...but that mens don‚Äôt stop until their early 30s. (But lets be clear, you do not need a fully fully fully developed brain to know a 21 is too young for you at 30)
i8uxei,How dumb do you have to be to cheat in your girlfriend while also sharing your location with her on your phone? I, for one, am happy that you‚Äôre no longer dating a dictionary-definition idiot.
i909r5,I've had this same conversation with my dad. He knows there is something to repair, but he wants examples just so he can argue with me about them.When he says things like this; "She pushed a couple more times for examples. "Is it because I missed some events your dad was at?"I tell him "that sounds like work you need to do in therapy. I can't help you work to an understanding of your actions when I'm the one that was impacted by them."He won't go to therapy, but I refuse to conduct therapy with him. So we are very low contact now.
i909r5,I tell him "that sounds like work you need to do in therapy. I can't help you work to an understanding of your actions when I'm the one that was impacted by them."That is a very good response I‚Äôm going to tuck away for future use, thank you.
i909r5,It's so insidious when they try to make you list out specific examples just so they can discredit them. Like, first of all, you're the parent here. You're supposed to be more emotionally sophisticated than your kid. You know what you've done wrong. And if you truly don't, you're a lost cause. And secondly, no matter how you try to minimize what you have/haven't done, that doesn't erase the emotional impact that had on your vulnerable child. Intentions don't matter when you've hurt someone. If you step on someone's toe, do you refuse to apologize because it wasn't your intention to hurt them? No, you acknowledge that you hurt them and say sorry.I just got out of a toxic relationship with an abusive man who I thought I could fix. I was a therapist to him and it sucked the soul out of me. I've finally learned that it's not my job to be a therapist to anyone. Not a man and certainly not my own parents. It's not our job to fix other people.
i909r5,Setting the JADE trap, they want to suck you in to the old (Justify-Argue-Defend-Explain) discussion so that the subject turns from your current boundaries to their subjective memories of the past.
i909r5,This was definitely my first step in trying to make it clear that I'm no longer her source of therapy. I know she was in therapy for a bit, but I don't think she's continued.It'd be really nice if our parents were willing to do the same work they seem to want us to do. That's a great response to your dad! Good luck with it moving forward and stay strong.
i909r5,Sorry, I am a bit confused. If you are upset with someone because they did or did not do something, and when you are having conversation precisely on that topic, why not answer when they ask you to list what is the thing you are upset about? Wouldn't answering that open up the conversation and potentially help see the other person their wrong and give them chance to correct?I have had people be upset with me and I have no idea whatsoever exactly what wrong I did, and then refuse to tell me what the thing was. That was incredibly frustrating.I haven't read the OPs original post, so I might be missing some context here.
i909r5,Good for you!! Setting boundaries with parents is hard work, sometimes the hardest work we will do and you did it kindly, directly, and firmly. I hope you can pat yourself on the back and find a way to reward yourself!!
i909r5,Setting boundaries with parents IS SO FUCKING HARD. OP should be super proud.
i909r5,Thank you! Definitely light pat on the back and had some celebratory cheesecake, as one does
i909r5,Next was asking for examples when she didn't support me. I told her she'd have to do some reflecting because she was there for the same events I was, and it's not fair to me to ask for that emotional labor. She said she had done "lots" of reflection and couldn't see it "until [stepdad] came into the picture". She pushed a couple more times for examples. "Is it because I missed some events your dad was at?" She stopped when I called her out the second time for deflecting responsibility for her actions. I told her multiple times during this portion that she doesn't have to remember/own up to anything, but she does have to live with the consequences.Wow!! This is fantastic, I almost want to send it to other support subs to sticky on top. You really couldn‚Äôt have handled her better.
i909r5,Exactly! I‚Äôm memorizing this in case I ever decide to get back in contact with my mom
i909r5,This was definitely helped by someone on my original post advising not getting into a big list with her. It took about 3 drafts of what I wanted to say to get rid of all the justifications. I also wrote down reminders to not explain for this part of the conversation. Very much saved by having written things down beforehand.
i909r5,What you did took guts. Kudos from this internet stranger. Its hard to be in the position you're in, and you handled it well. Stay strong, and good luck.
i909r5,Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è
i909r5,Holy moly you‚Äôve got some amazing emotional intelligence.Next was asking for examples when she didn't support me. I told her she'd have to do some reflecting because she was there for the same events I was, and it's not fair to me to ask for that emotional labor.This is amazing and I‚Äôm stealing it
i909r5,Wish I could give the gold for this.I wish I had of said something like that to my own mother years ago.Very effective and to the point!
i909r5,Steal away! Someone had posted on my original post about being careful not to get into listing, and this was the hardest part of the conversation. I'm hoping it gives her a different lens to look back with. I'm prepared for her to not dig up anything new, and if she wants to talk more, I'm willing to maybe give a few examples but I'm going to be adamant about not explaining why they were hurtful. If she can't see it, that's not my problem.
i909r5,I have saved this post for my future discussion of this with my own mother. This is the closest thing I have read that matches exactly what I have gone through. The only difference is that she and my bio dad have stayed together, which makes it tricky for saving my relationship with my dad. All other stories I‚Äôve read with narcissistic parents have them splitting up with their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù SO. Thank you so much for sharing your experience. I am very proud of you for maintaining your assertiveness and enforcing the boundaries you need to stay on top of mental health. That is so much easier said than done, and I am so happy for you. Hopefully it‚Äôs not weird for an internet stranger to say lol. I hope only the best for you in the coming years, and that you are able to continue holding your own üíï
i909r5,Good luck!!! I hope there's some world where your dad can recognize the pain your mom's caused and you can maintain that relationship if it's what you want. I'm definitely lucky in that most of my family is understanding. Feel free to message if you need to chat! Stay strong.
j267bi,She's blaming you because it's safer than blaming the person who is really responsible here.
j267bi,Right and her father knew and lied to her about it.
j267bi,She could blame her controlling husband or blame her controlling father. Both have consequences. Blaming OP she gets the same boost as bullying someone and none of the consequences.
j267bi,The cousin is upset because OP didn‚Äôt volunteer information, but as OP pointed out the cousin also didn‚Äôt volunteer information. But it‚Äôs the cousin‚Äôs life so of course OP is not to blame!
j267bi,I agree with the others that this isn‚Äôt your fault and that if your going along with an arranged marriage was such a big factor in her decision to do the same, she probably should have talked to you about it so you would have an opportunity to clear things up. However, this isn‚Äôt a problem that you can debate your way out of, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs helpful to focus on trying to convince her that you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. My advice would be to tell her that you‚Äôre sorry for the misunderstanding and that if you had known that it was being used to pressure her, you would have taken her side, and let her know that whatever she decides to do going forward, you‚Äôll be there to provide support in any way you can. I think that‚Äôs all you can do, and once you‚Äôve put that out there, unless/until she reaches out to you and wants to mend fences, I would try and stay out of it.
j267bi,This is really lovely, respectful, wholesome, and objective advice.
j267bi,We're all diagnosing 3 steps removed here, but consider the possibility that she didn't want to confirm with OP, because if she found out it wasn't arranged then she'd have to really decide what to do about it. Sometimes you don't question the easy lie that takes you down the path of accommodation because fighting for what's right is hard. It certainly sounds like if she had fought the arranged marriage it would have been very unpleasant for her in her family.
j267bi,This is in no way your fault. Your uncle is domineering and duplicitous. This is his fault. The problem with having parents like this is they take any resistance as a challenge to power. It is usually shut down harshly. Your cousin probably has no method of dealing with and all of that icky feeling is being directed at the only person she's allowed to be honest with, you.
j267bi,As the seemingly only person in this situation not trying to control her or force her into an arranged marriage, you're safe to lash out at. You won't be upset or angry with her for not wanting an arranged marriage. She can be open with her feelings towards you."Priya, I don't think I will ever fully understand your feelings related to your arranged marriage because I simply cannot live in your shoes, but I do want to be there for you and help you navigate this. Please let me know if you want to talk."
j267bi,She is projecting how she feels about herself onto you.While she can't use you as a model, she can certainly use your mother.Tell her you and your family will be there for her if she decides to end her marriage and do something else. If she comes after you again, be kind but firm. She is responsible for her own choices, and she doesn't get to attack you because she wishes she had made the decisions you have.
j267bi,I like, like most people here, don't come from a culture with a significant arranged marriage tradition, but to me, it doesn't sound like this is on you. Yes, if you'd made a big thing out of how your marriage wasn't arranged, it would have put her in a better spot. But, I'm guessing you're under considerable social sanction not to do that, same as she was under pressure to get an arranged marriage.This isn't your fault, but she's in a position where she can't strike out at the primary people responsible for her misery, her shitty husband & father, so try not to be too hard on her about it & help her get out if at all possible.
j267bi,It‚Äôs not you she‚Äôs REALLY mad at - it‚Äôs her dad/your uncle. He withheld and twisted the truth about your engagement, in order to manipulate her into doing something she wasn‚Äôt sure was the right thing for her. He did this because he knew that she trusts your judgment and would think, ‚Äúif OP is doing it and is happy with her choice, then it must be a good choice for me too.‚Äù He knew that she would find out the truth from you eventually, but he chose to lie anyway, banking on the fact that you would keep the detailed history of your relationship private until after her wedding. Who even knows what lengths he went to and what other lies he told to keep you and her from ever discussing it until now - I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him.Your cousin is right to feel like she was tricked and betrayed - but it wasn‚Äôt you who tricked her. You did nothing wrong! Her dad is the bad guy here. (Of course, I know he‚Äôs operating within a larger cultural context that influenced his behavior, and he genuinely believes that the arranged marriage was the best thing for your cousin - but, at the end of the day, he lied to his child in order to manipulate her into entering an unhappy marriage that she didn‚Äôt want, wasn‚Äôt ready for, and which isn‚Äôt working out. That‚Äôs bad parenting, full stop, no matter what culture you‚Äôre in.)Now, depending on how her dad raised her and how close she is with him, it may be very hard for her to recognize and accept all of this. She may still be in the FOG. It may not happen immediately, and she may push back against it. While it may take her a while to recognize that you aren‚Äôt the bad guy, I do think you should keep that line of communication open, so that she knows she can always come to you if/when she needs someone. Then, even if it takes a while for her to come around, she‚Äôll always know she has other options.I would first tell her that you never knew that her dad was lying to her, and that you would have told her the truth immediately if you did know, and would never have helped him lie. I‚Äôd also say that you think what her dad did was awful, and you‚Äôre sorry that he used your engagement to manipulate her (‚Äúsorry‚Äù as in you feel sympathy for her pain, not as in pretending that you did something wrong). Then, I‚Äôd focus on providing her with emotional support for now, both in dealing with this conflict with her dad, and with her ongoing problems with her marriage/husband.I also think you should let her know that while you aren‚Äôt going to pressure her to do anything, if she ever decides that she wants to get divorced, you WILL help her do it without judgment. Tell her that whether she stays in this marriage or not, you will stay in her life and love her forever, no matter what. I‚Äôm guessing the rest of the family want her to stay married, and clearly her dad is willing to lie to make her do what he wants - so I think it‚Äôs important for her to know that you won‚Äôt pressure her one way or the other, and that your relationship isn‚Äôt contingent on her doing what you want her to do.When she‚Äôs had some time to cool off, and to recognize/accept that her dad is the villain here and not you - then I am certain she will appreciate knowing that she has at least one family member who is honest, loves her unconditionally, will support whatever makes her happy, and will not pressure her to do things she isn‚Äôt comfortable with. I‚Äôm sure that her dad isn‚Äôt providing any of those things, and she might feel like the whole family agrees with him. I hope she realizes you aren‚Äôt in the wrong soon - but if not, I think you should leave it to where she knows you care and are there for her, even if she‚Äôs angry. I know it‚Äôs tough to have her upset at you, and I‚Äôm sorry your uncle has put you in this position.Finally: I‚Äôm sure that your mom and stepdad would be willing to support/help your cousin without judgment as well. They can also  serve as role models if she wants to leave her marriage - your mom‚Äôs story proves that a woman in your culture can find happiness after divorce, and both of them can attest that marrying for love can lead to happiness and contentment, even if family members disapprove. So if your cousin rejects you now, then you might ask your mom to reach out to her.
j267bi,Help her get out of her shitty marriage
j267bi,This. I don't think this is the end of a relationship with your cousin. It could be the beginning of a closer one.
j267bi,Help her get out of her shitty marriage family.
l4iqkx,Having a baby was like a nuclear bomb to my mental health. It ruined years of therapy and treatment to get my mind to a healthy place. And for two years after having a baby, I was an anxious mess. It took a lot of medication, exercise and work to get myself almost to the good mental health I had prior to having a baby. And I just have anxiety/ADHD/seasonal affective disorder.Definitely save up a fund so you can afford the amount of babysitting or nannying you might need if you do have kids.
l4iqkx,Around the births of our children, four years or so in total, my ex-wife changed quite a bit. She got really anxious, she started dreaming about planes crashing and the world ending. She bought heavily into the 2012 end-of-the-world crap, to the point of embarrassing my family and her social circle (the point being that this was driven by her anxiety).I became pretty sure she had GAD. She visited counsellors a few times, but in the end she convinced that nothing was wrong with her ("My counsellor says I'm doing everything right"). I hope she's doing better now.
l4iqkx,Oh God same! I was unmedicated and in the best place I'd ever been in mentally and emotionally when I got pregnant (after we'd been trying for the better part of a year. This was a planned and wanted pregnancy.) I had the worst midwife tell me that my past history with depression was not cause for concern and didn't mention it to my doctor, so I assumed I was fine. Looking back, I was not fine. The first year of my son's life was so rough on me, I barely remember it I was in such a depressed fog. It's taken almost 3 years and I'm still working with my doctors to get my medications worked out.OP, I'm so glad you and your wife are doing better, but please take some time to get yourselves sorted before diving back into baby making. Stick to practicing for now, work on each other, rebuilding your relationship because pregnancy and the fourth trimester fucking suck, and it'll take both of you working hard, mentally and emotionally, on a lack of sleep.
l4iqkx,Are you me? ditto and my sons name is Felix.
l4iqkx,I have a 4.5 year old and this comment is so f-ing true
l4iqkx,wow, this is lovely news! it also puts into perspective that even if things can truly get unbearable, you managed to fight for your own needs and desires and in the end it changed your relationship for the better too! Congratulations, and don't be surprised, a cat or kitten will turn your world upside down as well, hopefully you can find a good fit.I don't want to take away from your story but felt compelled to tell you about the situation of my father in law (FIL). My SO (29m) has filled me in on most of it, so take it with a grain of salt. During SO's teenage years my mother in law (MIL) and him clashed over the littlest things. He told me that they had screaming matches every single day, her emotions were always a priority and his father kinda checked out emotionally and just vented to his coworkers how unbearable the home situation was, without ever taking action (SO works at the same place now, that's how he knows this part). His father never once protected SO, never told his wife to get help or gotten himself any, and has become this person without hobbies, friends and a personality really. My MIL blamed hormones for everything, and later menopause, but to me that always made no sense. My mother also went through menopause when SO met her first and I kinda told him when he excused one of his mothers tantrums. It really floored him. The behavior of MIL had been so normalized to him, he was counting on women just being crazy between 40 and 60. When it dawned on him that not only does being hormonal not excuse 20 years of constant abuse, there are actually many products and services that can help with it, he honestly felt betrayed and lost. While I am NC with my I laws, SO is barely on speaking terms with them now. As a result of MILs behavior, they are missing out on a lot of good stuff.Oh, and her behavior has not changed, 65 and still being abusive. I wonder if she might have just always been horrible, hormones or not. So, back to your situation, I am so happy to see that you steered your life and your relationship into a much healthier path, and won't end up like my FIL. It is really sad when people think that they just have to roll over and take the punches instead of seeking help. Toxic masculinity at work in my FILs ans SO's case. My SO is also properly messed up and hurt as a result, and I just wish someone would have taken responsibility or action to get themselves help in that family.Sorry for ranting here, but I think I just tried to show you how far it can go and how lonely people might end up.
l4iqkx,Please, please please listen to this. Baby fever is fun but the hormones your wife will have are immense and could exacerbate life for you both. Not to mention sleepless nights,  stressful firsts learning about a new human and .... sleepless nights.
l4iqkx,You need to mind your own business. When they are emotionally prepared to have a child is a decision that lies between them and their respective medical professionals. We have seen a snapshot of this couple at their worst. You don't know how stable they are or how much better they are, and it would be impossible for you or me or anyone else on Reddit to know.Especially when infertility is involved, it is not unreasonable AT ALL to do planning without pulling the trigger.Source: am doctor
l4iqkx,I'm glad you're both getting the help you need right now, but having a child may be a terrible idea.
l4iqkx,It's great you recognised the problems and sought help. That was a huge step. Glad you're both doing better now! Thanks for sharing your story, wish you all the best!
l4iqkx,I‚Äôm glad your wife got a diagnosis and is on a treatment plan that is working for her now. Be prepared for that to change, however. My wife was also originally diagnosed with anxiety and was on medication but she just knew something was still off. It took her several doctors and appointments of her mentioning she thought she had PMDD for someone to take her seriously. She‚Äôs now found a combination of medications that work for her to treat her symptoms, and it is much more complex than just anxiety. Make sure you‚Äôre encouraging your wife to be honest about ALL her feelings, even if they‚Äôre scary. Many people with PMDD have suicidal ideations, paranoia, extreme irritability, etc. Good luck! Sounds like you are both doing your best and supporting each other how you know how right now.
l4iqkx,Don't forget occasional psychosis! But it iss ok, when your period starts you will be normal again.
l4iqkx,I have GAD and PMDD and I would love to know what medication is helping her because my docs tend to not take my medical needs seriously and I‚Äôm looking for information on medical management of these two conditions. TIA
l4iqkx,In addition to SSRIs, birth control is another popular way to "treat" PMDD. There's no cure, but hormonal BC prevents ovulation. As a result, your body's reproductive hormones never shift and can't trigger the PMDD.edit: It's typically much easier to get on HBC than anti-depressants, so might be worth trying out if your doctors aren't taking you seriously. Also, get new doctors.
l4iqkx,I don't know why, but reading your story made me cry. The part about you harming yourself after the death of your father really made me feel for you. I've been in pain that great myself, and I'm so glad you're taking the steps you need in order to get better. I am rooting for you, my friend. And your wife too.
l4iqkx,I can't really explain why this post got me teary. I'm very glad it turned out for the better, OP. I hope you have a nice recovery and props to your wife for admitting to her mistakes and getting the help she needed.
l4iqkx,So, I didn't see your original but I have PMDD and GAD. I went on a specific type of birth control to control the PMDD and it helped with my GAD. Getting diagnosed with PMDD was a journey in and of itself since a lot of the symptoms mimic GAD and depression. I was put on anti-depressants, anxiety meds, seeing someone about my intrusive thoughts. It wasn't until I started to develop new symptoms with my cycle that I was properly diagnosed with PMDD AND a GAD. Birth control saved my life.So first off, thank you for being kind to your wife in trying to get her help. If, she were like me, she was starting to feel like she was going crazy. It's hard to describe what it feels like to have literally no control over your emotions but at the same time know they aren't normal. To know that you're hurting people around you, to hurt yourself, and have no way to really stop it. It led me to consider suicide because I couldn't make it stop.Secondly, hold off on family planning. If she has GAD and could potentially have PMDD (again it's super hard to diagonise) PPD, PPA & PPR are a super high risk for people with GAD and/or PMDD. Make sure you keep her doctor(s) in the loop on your plan, but keep in mind, they might not think she's ready to take on new levels of hormones and anxiety.
l4iqkx,Errrrr... baby planning? Noo nono. I don't think someone like this should be having children. Keep working on the stability of your relationship, because after all that, the foundation is as weak as paper.
l4iqkx,Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt know what GAD is?
hn0j6j,Just a practical suggestion, could you remind your husband that the hovering is making you angry and you need time to figure out the baby stuff on your own, so you're going to pick a two hour block of time daily that is mom-baby time, and either everyone else has to go away or really truly commit to not intervening unless it's an actual emergency. I'd have picked the first two hours of the day because that's when my babies were happy and fun, but evening bathtime/bedtime would be a great time to practice a whole bunch of feeding, bathing, diapering, dressing, and soothing skills.If you have a set window, it might reduce the effort required of you to push back if someone encroaches. Like instead of a whole explanation, you can just repeat "No, this is my time."
hn0j6j,Good idea, thank you!
hn0j6j,Absolutely agree with this. But also get comfortable with packing up for a couple hours and LEAVE THE HOUSE with your baby. You want alone time with him? Just get away. Babies are super duper portable. Head to a local park or garden or go sit and read a book to him at the library or walk around the block twelve times.
hn0j6j,Maybe offer to give him a set window was well when you let him have baby time too? Then when you show him the respect of giving him undivided baby time, he'll understand more why you want yours. Everything else can be shared time where you sort of figure it out in the moment. While these set times you each get. And then maybe you take that time to go for a walk by yourself even! I always underestimate how much physicly stepping outside of the space that I am stressed out in, helps my mental space and allows me to regulate my emotions just a bit more.You're a mom and you're asking for help on how to get your time to be that mom. But don't forget you're also you, a separate human. Take time to yourself to breathe and think. Plus, you're child will one day recognize that, and learn that skill as well.
hn0j6j,‚Äú.08M‚ÄùNever thought I‚Äôd see it written like that
hn0j6j,By the time I have worked out how old the baby is, he isn't that age and I have to work out what 0.9m is
hn0j6j,My sense of humor is still hanging on, fortunately.
hn0j6j,366*.08=29.2 days old.
hn0j6j,Ok this might sound a little crazy....but my husband was in the same position as you (minus a MIL 'helping') with our first and I was in the your husbands position ( a lot of childcare experience, but I also had PPD/A). My husband told me multiple times to leave him be but my anxiety would get the better of me. Eventually he would put on a bright red t-shirt which we called his 'I GOT THIS' shirt. When he had it on, nobody was to mess with what he was doing with babe. It was a big blaring visual reminder for me that he did not want help/suggestions/to be watched while with baby. He would put it on when he was going to practice/learn/figure out his own way of dealing with baby and it helped me sooooo much to know that when he was wearing it he didnt want anyones help. I wouldnt offer and he wouldnt feel like crap about it. That way he could communicate where he was at without having to verbalize/risk a fight.
hn0j6j,Oh that's a really clever suggestion! Thank you!
hn0j6j,I second this or some other nonverbal cue to let him know you want to do it on your own. It feels weird and naggy to constantly say ‚ÄúI got this.‚Äù If you agree that a snap or raise of your hand in a stop motion means I have this handled he might respond more easily and it might make you feel like less of a nag. I‚Äôm just wondering if he has some struggles with impulsivity and just doing without thinking. A gestural cue is much easier to pick up on and absorb if it‚Äôs agreed upon beforehand. I may be completely barking up the wrong tree, but he may need additional support with taking a moment to stop himself from acting.
hn0j6j,Great idea! I was squeezed out of taking care of my infant son, and I tried to express that, but I couldn‚Äôt get through. At one time, I physically removed my son from my MIL.Context: my (ex) FIL did not carry his son at all the first 18 months. Or change diapers.
hn0j6j,You should tell him that you want MIL to leave and give you some space to be a new mom. You feel like it's him and her vs. you. Tell him that you need him to back you up.It sounds like he's smothering the hell out of you and that would drive anyone crazy. Get used to telling him and MIL to give you space. "I'm changing the diaper. Go into the other room and let me handle this," or "I'm filling the bottle. Go sit down and do xyz."Get used to this phrase: "I am doing this thing. I will tell you if I want help." When he forgets, reiterate that you are doing it and you will ask for help if you want it. Really nail it into him.Honestly, if you have to, drag him to the doctor with you and explain all this to the doctor.
hn0j6j,Thanks for the suggested verbiage. TBH I have tried setting these boundaries but I'm just sooooo tired and depressed most of the time it's easier to give in.
hn0j6j,Can you show him this post and read through the comments with him? It sounds like you‚Äôve perfectly described your feelings and the conflict, and honestly, most of the time it‚Äôs easier to write it all down and organize it exactly like you‚Äôve done here. The next step is getting through to him.He‚Äôs not showing up for you like he needs to and he needs to understand that. Actions need to be taken and your MIL needs to leave so you can bond with YOUR baby.Lastly, you are a good mother and a good human. You are allowed to feel your feelings and they are 100% valid because YOU feel them. It doesn‚Äôt matter what his intentions are when his and his mother‚Äôs actions make you feel this way in your bones.
hn0j6j,I like that last phrase! OP, something like that when you‚Äôve already discussed it and you‚Äôre tired might be really helpful if just repeated flatly until he gets it and backs up off you. I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre going through this, it sounds like you‚Äôre worn down to your last nerve! I hope the therapy helps and that husband gets it through his head that you need practice to learn.
hn0j6j,This, and tell him to stop sharing your problems with his mommy. Sounds like they never cut his umbilical cord from her.
ibfil4,I remember your original post, this is a very sweet update. Actions certainly speak louder than words and his actions seem to be saying that he loves you. I wish you two a happy future together!
ibfil4,Thank you,  I certainly feel like he loves me. They do say actions speak louder than words üòÅ
ibfil4,He Solo-ed you! He's a keeper ‚ù§
ibfil4,Haha yes definately. Now I just need to see of I can find a golden bikini before the weekend üòÑ
ibfil4,awww that is so cute! sometimes it is really hard to untangle specific phrases from the person they were first used on (a lot)!I know it is totally not the same, but in my second relationship 'I like you' (translated) meant the real deal as we both did not feel like 'I love you' was the right thing to say. so you finding out that you are quite content with the reply 'I know!' is wonderful!
ibfil4,Thank you. It's amazing how you can be ridiculously happy about things that you didn't expect. It's definately better to feel loved than for someone to just say the words üòÅ
ibfil4,So did that second relationship work out? Really asking
ibfil4,As a man who lost a child and then his wife ran away I know the sense of loss from a mans perspective. A death and a loss of your close trusted confidante.Right at that moment He was processing feelings of happiness and joy at being with you but tinged with guilt because he felt like he felt like he was  cheating, just a tiny bit, on his deceased wife.Where does that leave you?  ‚Äî‚Äî- you are an angel who has gracefully spent time with him and shown him love in your 7 month relationship. He has had time to process this and probably cant believe it him self.He was probably resigned to bringing up the kids and who would want him, he was too old ....... believe me women of your age  tell you that when you are his age.He is definitely happy to share his family with you, that little enclave of his deceased wifes legacy, that final private space,  that is TRUST and you must have built a solid foundation to get there.I think he will respond in time with those key words but maybe choose the time well. He would not have brought you into his most trusted world without serious emotion.Conclusion(My story is only stated to show I qualify to say what follows)For me the death of my infant son, my ex blaming her self and running away was like a death of her.  A man in love takes time, a long time to pass those guilt feelings that make you feel like you are cheating just a little bit, on the dead.These are traits of a faithful and loyal man, loyal even to death. You girls would call him a keeperYou are inside his inner sanctum ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî he loves you. He just needs time (what he sees as suitable time enough not to be a betrayal of her memory) but he is also rationalising that it is a memory and that is why you are now with his kidsBless you ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî bless you both heaps(yes you are an angel to him)
ibfil4,This is so well written.I can see that with the BF.OP...just be patient. He may still be mourning his dead wife and mother of his children. But also surprised at himself that he's found love again.Just be patient. Don't push. Let him say the words in his own time, in his own way. He will say them when he's good and ready and feels comfortable. Right now he is showing you in so many big and little ways, just how he feels about you. Just be patient. It will mean so much more when he finally does say the words whether it's today, tomorrow,  next week, next month, next year or however long it takes. Let his actions speak for him, and so far, they are speaking VOLUMES.So happy for you.
ibfil4,Thank you and I'm so very sorry to hear about your situation and hope you are looking after yourself.He certainly thinks of himself as old and past it at times, well he'll jokingly talk about being a grumpy old man but he's not (well maybe a little grumpy first thing before his first cup of coffee lol) I have to point out for an old man he sure has a lot of energy!
ibfil4,My Nan and Papa were married for 60 years and she could count on one hand how many times he's said I love you, but he always provided, was an excellent father figure and always tried to make her happy by doing the things he knew she appreciated and vice versa, of course. Maybe your beau was rebuked at a young age by saying it to someone and it makes him overly cautious, you'll never know till you ask! Sounds like you're almost comfortable enough to, if he's the real deal it wouldn't be a fatality to the relationship at all. Good luck!
ibfil4,That's really sweet about your Nan and Papa. I'm pretty sure he does love me, maybe I'll try the silly way of asking üòÅ
ibfil4,I‚Äôm literally standing at the store shopping for wedding stuff and tearing up like an idiot.This post makes me so happy for you and I don‚Äôt even know you. Congrats on your amazing little family and a lifetime of even happier moments!
ibfil4,Congratulations on your upcoming wedding üòÅ Hopefully that'll be me in a year or two! üòÄ
ibfil4,This made my day to read! He loves you. He is showing you in all the major ways. I, too, said I love you first to my husband. He waited until the next day to tell me he loved me too. We had been at a friend's house having drinks. He wanted to make sure we were sober. Regardless, I felt comfortable saying it because he showed me how he felt. I'm definitely a "words of affirmation" person, but he taught me how to see it in actions as well. I think I find the actions so much more comforting than just hearing "I love you". It makes you feel secure. I am so happy for you! Have fun with those sweet kids too!
ibfil4,Thank you. The kids are very sweet, but I've seen a tantrum or two now! Especially when he had to explain to daughter that i wasn't going to be taking it in turns having sleepovers in her room üòÇBut waking up in the morning at his house is a whole new world. I go from snug with my man to playing with toys in like 5 minutes. It's lush üòÅ
ibfil4,Aw man I really hope the best for you guys! Those are some real "showing not telling" ways. The meal plan really got me, actually.
ibfil4,Oops - maybe I shouldn't have teased him about that then......told him it was a sneaky way of getting me to cook lol üòÖ
jqezuc,You can't force your husband to get back in touch with his family, and if you try it's likely to cause problems between the two of you as well.You can say, once, "I know you're still hurt by the way they treated you and us, but I worry that you're going to regret it if you don't see your grandfather before he passes away and I don't want to see you hurt even more by this. I totally support whatever you decide to do, but this is the evidence that he's sick, and I believe your sister when she says that he probably doesn't have much time left. Please think about it, and let me know if you need to talk."Then leave him alone. He knows his family better than you, it's possible that they really are using this crisis to try to bring him back in, where the control tactics and manipulation will start again. Trust your husband to know what he needs.
jqezuc,Thank you for this advice. I have an incredibly rocky and complicated relationship with my family and am almost NC, especially with my dad. When that comes up in convo I keep it brief and just tell people it‚Äôs complicated and I‚Äôve tried a lot to make things better. A lot of people try to push and say shit like ‚Äúit‚Äôs your family, they‚Äôre the most important‚Äù, or other ignorant crap. In the very few times that I‚Äôve actually opened up and shared SOME of the details, people literally get choked up and sad...like secondhand trauma. They never try to bring up reconciliation again. Sharing a different perspective that OPs husband may regret not seeing his grandpa is helpful caring, and simply aims to see the problem from a different angle. But then leave it. It‚Äôs OPs husband‚Äôs choice, he knows how he feels and I know for a FACT, he‚Äôs thought about these more than anyone knows. Respect someone‚Äôs boundaries and choices. That‚Äôs always the right answer.
jqezuc,If grandpa was closest to him, why did he go NC with grandpa? Maybe grandpa said something similar to what his parents said, or asked him to give into their elitist demands to ‚Äúkeep the peace‚Äù in the family.
jqezuc,My grandma had a stroke 2 months after I moved out from the abusive household and I‚Äôve only gone to see her once. The second time I tried, they all pulled the same shit they used to.I haven‚Äôt gone since. I get where OP is coming from but she shouldn‚Äôt push this.
jqezuc,Piggybacking on this as there might be another thing going on here. If he was close to his grandfather it might be scary and sad to see him pass. It might be easier to tell himself "it's all a lie" until it's too late. And he may be saving himself emotional pain.I live on a different continent than my family. When my grandparent that I was closest with passed I didn't have the option to go see her. But to be honest, it was easier for me that way. I didn't have to see her in pain and declining. I didn't have to comfort family through it. I didn't have to live it day in and day out until she eventually passed. I just continued on in my normal life. Yes, in some ways it would have been great to see her - but in a lot of others it was far easier to miss the end of her life.
jqezuc,Piggybacking top comment because I've been in this exact scenario. Went no contact with my dad (divorced parents) and about a year and a half later my grandfather passed unexpectedly. I was young at the time and was too afraid of that side of my family to travel alone to the funeral. While I dont blame younger me for not having that courage, I am sad I never got to sad goodbye to my grandfather and my namesake (who I loved despite my dad). Consider how future you may feel about the choices you make today. I dont blame myself because I was a child. But if I made those same choices today I dont think I could have lived with it.
jqezuc,This. You can‚Äôt get in the middle of your partners family drama, even more so if it‚Äôs centered around them not wanting them to be with you.
jqezuc,This is one of the best responses that I have read in r/relationships.  I love that you emphasize saying it ONCE, so say it all the way the way through.
jqezuc,If OP's husband doesn't have ill will towards his grandfather, like he only got caught in the crossfire of NC, then maybe OP can suggest that the est of the family be absent if her husband does visit grandpa. I know they'll still try to come then, but it's something.
jqezuc,Why don't you try and ensure that the rest of the family won't be there when husband arrives, see if you can say to SIL that you won't agree to pester your husband unless they can agree not to be there.Man that's sad. You're in a tough position there
jqezuc,It is likely that them trying to stop marriage was the last straw in larger history of controlling behavior. You treat it is singular exceptional event, by but he likely see it as part of larger pattern.I think it is not just about him feeling hurt. Cutting parents off is hard emotionally. Even if those parents are narcistic or abusive. He might be refusing to trust then now for that reason - contact might re-open emotional can of worms. If they are the kind of people who could plausibly lie about this, if he is not paranoid, contact is risky.How much do you two talk about his childhood? Maybe it would be worth asking him about.
jqezuc,I agree, came here to say similar - this was probably part of a much larger long standing pattern, unfortunately.
jqezuc,If you talk to the toxic ex, even once, they‚Äôre going to rope you back in. He‚Äôs probably feeling the same way about his family.
jqezuc,His insistence in maintaining NC makes me think that his issues go far beyond threats of disowning or disinheritance.  Maybe they were abusive when he was younger and he hasn't been able to discuss it with you yet, maybe they said unforgivable things about you and he never told you to spare your feelings.  As much as I agree with you, I think the most important thing here is to support your husband regardless of what he decides.
jqezuc,Do NOT go behind his back and contact them. Don't badger him into reconnecting with them. He went no contact for a good reason. He can make the choice to communicate with them or not. They only came to you because he won't answer them.I sincerely doubt they've changed their views or behavior.  They want to weasel their way back into his life, and try to control him. What you heard about them not wanting him to marry you? Probably  not even the tip of the iceberg. There was probably plenty of behind- the-scenes shittiness you didn't get to hear about.In any case, please don't force your husband to contact them, and don't contact them. Let him decide how he wants to approach this.
j2hohg,To quote the Mindy Project, "best friend is not a person, it's a tier". I have friends going back to middle school, who I would rate as best friends, but for all I know many of them have other "best friends". In fact, I know my cousin who is among my "best friends" will rate her childhood friend and her closest work friend among her other best friends.Now, I don't know how to shift your perspective to that direction but I think it can be helpful to recognize you are one of her best friends, just not the one and only, because she clearly has more history with Annie. In the same way that my cousin's work friend can't ever have the same intimate connection due to history that me and cousin share, I can't share the connection they have because of their unique professional experiences and physical proximity (they live next door, I live in a different city). Our friendships are different but equal in a way?It may also help to cherish and think about your other close friendships. Maybe you will find some people who can join your "tier".
j2hohg,I can't share the connection they have because of their unique professional experiences and physical proximity (they live next door, I live in a different city). Our friendships are different but equal in a way?I think this is the way to look at it. I'm the same as OP, my best friend has three other women in her life who are her best friends - and there's no way I can compete with that, they've known each for over twenty years, they went through the loss of another friend together, there's just no comparison.But she just had her first baby, and whereas all her best friends already have at least two kids each, I'm still single and childless. So while they've been helpful but have their own families to look after, I've been able to visit her every week to help with the baby and can give far more time and attention than they can. We've got a little routine we share that they can't compete with either. So despite not being arguably the most important person in her life, I still have value and we still have things that belong to our friendship.
j2hohg,Excellent point you've mad and I would agree. OP you are right up there with the people she cherishes the most. Look at it this way there may be a newer friend among the group that will or dose look at you as their BFF but you may not look at them that way because your BFF is Kasie  and that not a bad thing.A wise person once told me if you can find just one truly good friend in life then you are a lucky person, and form the sounds of it you have found even more.  So if you can try not to look at it as a bad thing but a great thing because of the fact all three of you are besties.
j2hohg,Thanks - I hadn't heard that.  I've always hated the term best friend because it feels like a ranking system.  I'm pretty sure I am not my best friend's best friend, but I've always been ok with that cause I know we're both important to each other.
j2hohg,I‚Äôm glad this is the top comment because I came to say the very same thing. Best friend is a tier.I have 2 best friends that I‚Äôve known for 23 years and even within our tight group we each have our own person that we go to most. But we‚Äôre still like sisters and love each other like family.These type of relationships happen gradually though, and OP may look up in a year or more and realize that they have become an inseparable trio with their own dynamics.
j2hohg,The 'it's a tier' comment (that several people have posted, thank you!) is really helpful. It made me think about ways that my friendship with Kasie is different from her friendship with Annie (and how mine with Annie is different from her friendship with Kasie). Kasie and I like to veg out and gossip and watch movies together while Annie is very 'get up and go,' and Annie and I are both big nerds who like to play board games together while Kasie would rather die.It's going to take me time to get over this but I appreciate your kind words.
j2hohg,This! I have had many ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù in my life, and I am still close to most of them, but I could never pin down just one as the absolute ‚Äúbest‚Äù.  There are elements of friendship that are down to simple chance- at what life stage did you meet, how long  were you in close proximity, how much shared experience and background do you have- and in some ways, I think being very close to someone who isn‚Äôt your oldest friend shows a higher level of compatibility and intimacy.My best friend from high school and the friend I probably talk to most often now as an adult live in the same city (quite far from me) and are super close, although they have known each other a shorter time than I have known them both. I assume they would describe each other as ‚Äúbest friends.‚Äù Instead of being jealous about this, I am thrilled that my friend network has this tight link in it, that I can vacation together with besties from different phases of my life and text them in a joint thread about big news and know that they‚Äôre looking out for each other while I am too far for frequent visits.The phrase ‚Äúcompersion‚Äù is used by polyamorous people to describe joy taken in the pleasure and happiness of people you love, even if it isn‚Äôt happiness of your creation. I‚Äôm not poly, but I think it‚Äôs a beautiful concept that can help to ease a lot of insecurity and sadness when used to reframe personal relationships. Being happy that your friends are happy is so much nicer to experience than being sad and feeling threatened by it.
j2hohg,This, I had 3 best men at my wedding all making speeches. To not play favourites I had my mum hand us the rings.
j2hohg,Omfg I quote that Mindy line all the time. I have lots of besties and I truly believe friendships ebb and flow out of your life. I had a huge zoom birthday party and when I went around introducing people, 70% of them were introduced as my bestie. I‚Äôm honestly not sure if any of them consider me as their number 1 bestie (or their bestie at all) and that‚Äôs okay. I know my number 1 bestie always refers to me as one of his top 5 people in his life so I know I‚Äôm not his ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù but I don‚Äôt really feel the need to be his favorite.
j2hohg,I love this reply. I have more than one best friend too. And she has other best friends.Friends enhance your life. Why limit them?
j2hohg,I have a friend who has gotten very close to someone in her group who calls her "best friend." But she has a specific "best friend" from when she was much younger who has to have that "crown." It doesn't matter which one this friend is closer to, she feels obligated to her original "best friend."And to her, these designations are only making her feel bad. Why should such a wonderful person have to choose? It's kind of juvenile once you're grown to single people out as less and more important to you.
j2hohg,This is brilliant! I agree, I have a few " best friends", one who was my neighbor for a while, one who I've been friends with since middle school, and another whom I was best friends with through high school but is now long distance. They are all very important to me, the nature of our friendships are different, I care about them all equally. I love this "tier", it's an accurate description of adult friendships.
j2hohg,To not quote Mindy Project, this person is concerned that there's no one who will make HER maid of honor. She wants that closeness with someone and sees Annie as an obstacle to that even though they get along very well. What you're saying is something she already knows, and your entire comment is a huge yammer.
j2hohg,Now I really want to rewatch the Mindy Project. But I also liked your comment. Have my upvote.
mij4ms,And that, kids, is why we use communication with our S/O's.
mij4ms,This! most problems can be solved with good communication.communication is king
mij4ms,Not to be an ageist but I really wouldn‚Äôt expect 20 year olds to have the best communication skills in a monogamous relationship.
mij4ms,Except there are just as many examples of this exact kind of communication being followed by the exact original behavior.That's why you'll see half the people saying ditch them and half saying talk it out. Both are right enough of the time to be good advice.
mij4ms,It sounds like this might be the first relationship you've been in where you can talk about a problem you're having with your SO and have them actually care about how you're feeling/want to resolve the problem? If so, I totally understand why this was such a novel relationship experience for you! I'm glad you guys were able to resolve this and come out stronger on the other side. :)
mij4ms,It sounds like this might be the first relationship you've been in where you can talk about a problem you're having with your SO and have them actually care about how you're feeling/want to resolve the problem?It's definitely the first time I've had a guy be so understanding and like actually acknowledge how I'm feeling.
mij4ms,This is the important difference between communication and comprehension.You can speak as much as you want, but if your partner cannot comprehend where you're coming from, communication will resolve into nothing.It's fantastic to see that you and your partner are on the same page all together! üíìüíìüëè
mij4ms,What happened with the friend?Also, glad it worked out with your bf üëçüèæ
mij4ms,IP stated in the original post, she dumped the friend(and good riddance!).
mij4ms,Glad to hear things worked out.I was honestly getting paranoid because I've been cheated on before.Don't ignore red flags and the need to reasonably check on what your partner is doing (in general in relationships), but also keep in mind that only YOU have this paranoia and trauma from past relationships.He doesn't, so I totally see how this attempt by your friend to hook up was a non-issue for him, he shot her down hard, matter was resolved in his mind, and thus not worth mentioning.  He should have told you (so you could build trust), but the point I'm trying to make is he didn't do it out of malice, he just didn't have the same mental perspective as you because he didn't have the trauma.And you should take care of that trauma by talking to a therapist.  If you don't, you're basically burdening him with it.But, good that things worked out, and wish you guys the best for the future.  Keep that communication going, it really strengthens the relationship.
mij4ms,I mean I haven't been cheated on either but I have the common sense to recognize that this situation is something you need to be upfront with your partner about. It's not that her past experience made her expect something abnormal it's that he was being a kind of patronizing idiot who thought it was his place to decide whether or not she gets to know one of her friends pulled such a stunt.
mij4ms,Glad it got sorted,  I hope you aren't interacting with her anymore
mij4ms,Communication is key.. it provides perspective and understanding. Your friends need to see your side of this too so they arent constantly trying to be suspicious of him too. And you definitely dont have to assume the worst, but that doesnt mean you go all the way to the other end and assume he cant do anything wrong either.Everything has to be within reason and understanding and maturity. But I'm really glad this was so easily settled
mij4ms,Maybe you need new friends then if they feed into your paranoid tendencies? You are who you surround yourself with so if you're around cynical assholes all day, you're likely gonna be like them. If you surround yourself with positive people you'll have a better outlook on life.
mij4ms,Congratulations on working it out OP! Keep up the good communicative work! Y'all are both catches, hoping for the best for y'all!
iijj64,Some thoughts:Don‚Äôt make a joke of this to her.  She‚Äôs fragile enough that it‚Äôll feel in turns both threatening and confusing for her.Clearly she‚Äôs happy with the arrangement you guys have, a sort of ersatz nuclear family which carries little emotional demands and high rewards for both of you ie your kids get the love and structure they need from two adults who care for them and each other sans the drama.  Not to mention each of you playing Mum and Dad creates that polarity which enhances a possible attraction.So I must ask this:  Are you absolutely sure you‚Äôre in love with her as a woman?  I mean, forget the convenience and comfort of it all- just her as an individual, would you have chosen her without all of this going on?I ask because as soon as the shock wears off, she‚Äôs going to wonder if it‚Äôs that or if there‚Äôs real substance to your feelings.  No one wants to feel like a stand in and it will confuse her in the sense that she‚Äôll have to start questioning herself as to if this is something she wants in general ie dating again, if you‚Äôre what she wants or if you‚Äôre just convenient, all those feelings of disloyalty to her now gone husband will be A LOT of emotion for her to deal with.Which brings me to your expectations.  This is an ‚Äúover the fullness of time‚Äù situation.  Unlike your ex, her former husband has now been idealized for perpetuity. He will never do any wrong, he will never be less to her, and he will always reign first in her heart.  A love halted before its time and shrouded in grief can become a safe space for someone - as at least she can always say, I was married once, I did have that once - and depending where she is in her grief, she may choose to stay there for a very long time and not go further.Whereas you, whilst hurt by your ex‚Äô betrayal, are probably thanking your lucky stars she peaced out - no one wants the chaos of addiction around their kids.  So your grief is different, you were left behind due to human flaw, and have been much too busy caring for your children.So while you share the state of being abandoned, each of your grief is personal and different.  You will forever be second to the man who‚Äôs gone before you and I hope you can accept that.More to the point, you cannot launch this on her and expect a simple yes or no.  That‚Äôs irresponsible.If you want to prove to her that you are the man she believes you are, you‚Äôre going to have to think steps ahead.6.  That means, you need to start getting more personal time with her without the pressure of a proposal to be romantic with each other.  Declaring it poses an unnecessary immediacy when I don‚Äôt see a need - neither of you are rushing to date other people.You need time alone with her just to hang out and talk without the kids always around you.  Don‚Äôt ask her out formally, just carefully position yourself by getting time together like maybe stopping by and dropping off her fave coffee.There‚Äôs obviously some danger here of being friend zoned but the trick to that is not to allow her to treat you like a gf.  Just short bursts of personal time with intentional acts of attention, like if it‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day get her flowers, then joke ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre not my Mum, but I‚Äôm so impressed by how you are with the kids that I just had to get you this.‚Äù  If that extends to a deeper conversation, say something like, ‚Äúyou being how you are makes me really think of who I should have in my life‚Äù.Always leave it a bit short on details to give her a chance to pursue it or leave it.Then the next time just give her flowers for no reason.Now she will either suss that this is getting romantic and will show you if she‚Äôs uncomfortable with it, OR she‚Äôs going to start looking at you and going hmmmm.7.  Here‚Äôs why I suggest this:  like it or not, you guys are actually good for your kids together.  And the potential of losing that just because she‚Äôs not where you are romantically, or worse, she may react negatively out of panic, is well - not really something you want.8.  I agree with ppl saying don‚Äôt run it by your in laws.  It‚Äôs not their concern right now and it may even be a non starter.  Who knows right?9.  As more time passes you‚Äôll be able to tell if she‚Äôs more open or not, and that‚Äôs when you go full court press.  Even if she turns you down, you‚Äôve gained enough information about her and how she feels about being romantically involved that you‚Äôll likely be able to talk about your options together more comfortably.10.  Obviously, follow all caution not to be neutered in her eyes.  A lot of that you can help by keeping the polarity electric, meaning do things that keep each of you in that state of awareness of your maleness vs her femaleness.  I sound like a douche but I don‚Äôt know how else to put it.But here‚Äôs an ex.  I know when a guy‚Äôs interested in me if he mentions how much he makes or does something overtly manly.  Once I was on holiday in the Seychelles and the very married son of the pensione owner took one look at me and decided he would fling his shirt off and chop wood right in front of my breakfast window.  I was literally a captive audience.  I wasn‚Äôt going to pursue it by any stretch, but it was his version of hey babe.  Like seriously he went through an entire tree trunk, it was amusing and flattering.I wish you luck OP, I get where you‚Äôre coming from and I don‚Äôt think this is impossible.  I just think you have to be very careful to see things from her perspective and walk that fine line between gentle and exciting.PS if this works I‚Äôll expect an invite to the wedding.
iijj64,First off thank you for such insight and the time it must have taken to write this, if I could Upvote a thousand times I would.Alright, so some of this stuff I've already been doing before I had any sort of romantic feelings. Mother's day actually is one and this year I did get flowers for her and I do try to be the "Man around the House." for her like if her car is having trouble or there's something around the house that needs fixing. And she's gotten me father's day cards too.When it comes to her husband, I know I could never replace him and that he'll always be her first love and that love will never diminish nor would I want it to. It's not the same by any stretch, but by the time he had died he'd basically become closer to me than any of my actual brothers. I had started to take him under my wing and show him baby basics and what Dads ought to know. Losing him ripped my heart out. He was just the best kind of person taken way too early and if I've got to be in anyone's shadow, I'm glad it's his.I am sure that I'm in love with her. I've argued the question you asked me over and over again sometimes trying to give myself an excuse to not look at her the way I do. I've tried to feel anything toward her, but she just has a way with me. If you take our children and my adoration for how she cares for them and how much they like her, if we remove the basis for our normal interaction here's what I have.She's got a dark sense of humor that makes me actually laugh. She is very kind and thoughtful and I know this sounds weird, but speaks properly. When she smiles at me it makes me stop thinking, when I know I'm going to see her, that's all I can think about. She remembers little things I've told her from forever ago like a favorite food and she'll make it for dinner if we're all eating together. Like I forget I told her this and there it is lol.I think this just became completely unbearable to me after she spent the night. Obviously nothing happened, no kiss, no sex, but we had a couple drinks together and we were just ourselves. No Mom no Dad, no Bil or Sil just me and her and it felt good and real. We listened to music, talked about it, and really just loostened up.And in the morning, waking up to breakfast cooking for the first time in like 7 years, to hear happy kids, it was like walking into a dream. She said good morning and kissed me on the top of my head. No flirtatious looks, nothing suggestive, she said nothing about it, but I almost became a cartoon character with his heart flying out of his chest lol.It made me question whether she's playing the same game as me and concealing feelings for a lot of different reasons. That questioning filled me with the need to know, because if it's just me with a crush on her I can deal with that and ignore it for the greater good, but if I feel like I do for her and have the slightest indication she might feel the same way, I want to see it fulfilled. Anyhow, thank you again.
iijj64,I see a lot of good points in here. Make me your plus one if that's invite come in.
iijj64,Best response I‚Äôve ever read! I‚Äôm hooked on your writing style and brilliance!
iijj64,Dude, don‚Äôt run it by your in-laws before running it by her. Talk to her and see if it would be something she‚Äôs in to - and crucially, if she says no, accept it and don‚Äôt let it hinder your relationship with her.
iijj64,That's the plan thus far. I only made the remark to the inlaws just to see what they'd say where I could back out if questioned on it. If she says no I kill it right there, apologize for the weirdness and learn to be okay with that.
iijj64,Wow that's a lot you have all been through. I think the  person who will help you navigate this is your SIL. Your inaws are processing all of this in their own way and it would be unlikely they would see things from your angle, at least not in the begining. My advise would be to tell her your feelings,  or some lighter version of them. Express your desire to continue having her in your life and your hope's that with times continued  healing that you two could become more. I would tell her you have infinite patience for her healing process and that there is no pressure for more unless/if she feels it is time. And above all I would tell her you want her as a part of your families life no matter what her feelings. (Unless that is too much for your heart) I hope you find your way through this and that you all find healing.
iijj64,I've asked her to dinner when her parents have the kids and if it feels right I'm going to try and test the waters. The beach in across the street from where we are going so maybe a night stroll. I do have all the patience in the world for her healing process as her late husband was a very close friend of mine too and I sometimes get teary-eyed thinking of him. I feel a sudden tugs of guilt for that reason, like somebody might think something morbid like I was waiting in the wing for her, but I only developed these feelings after she started coming around more after he passed.It's not just my affection for her, it's the way my kids light up when they see her. I've never looked at prospective partner with "Would they make a good mom?" but she's so wonderful with them it softens me. I hope she feels something remotely like this.
iijj64,No insight but I hope this is updated if something is said it happens. This might be the dreamer in me, but this sounds like a happy ending everyone(You, your son, and us Reddit readers. Can't really speak for others in your life) wants. Best of luck!
iijj64,I have a feeling if things went in a positive manner, our families would be happy for us after the initial shock.
iijj64,There has been a lot of tragedy and heart ache in both your life and hers. There is a possibility that getting together could go wrong, that you wouldn‚Äôt work out well as a couple and that would be so damaging for the family, especially the kids.I do feel kissing you on the forehead is a sign, but also she‚Äôs still wearing the ring so she‚Äôs not quite ready yet. I would find a time to tell her about your feelings but if you date, TAKE IT SLOWLY. Don‚Äôt pressure her and don‚Äôt tell your kids about it. Communicate with her and make sure both of you are comfortable with your relationship before telling anyone, especially your kids and her parents.From the sound of it, both of you seem like reasonable, caring people. It would be truly wonderful if you can turn the heartbreak and sadness both of you experienced into something beautiful that will last. But you have to be patient and go slowly.
iijj64,Oh no I certainly wouldn't tell my kids, they've been through enough, and I do plan on taking it slowly. As for her and the ring, she asked me once if I thought her taking it off would be a betrayal to him. Or what would I do if say my ex died instead of cheated. I told her that I might not always wear it on my hand, but I'd probably always wear it around my neck, to always keep that love and spirit around, but to show that I was now seeking companionship, remove it from my hand. She liked the idea. I also said it wasn't betrayal. I loved her husband too, in a different way obviously, but thinking way tooo far ahead, if I were to marry her and she chose to keep wearing that ring with mine, I'd be more than supportive of that.
iijj64,Here's the thing, I have absolutely no advice on this matter. But what I'm going to need you to do is GO FOR IT, then come back with an update. It will be the best thing to happen in 2020.
iijj64,Well I see her on Sunday for dinner, so hopefully I have something to tell by Monday lol
iijj64,Well I see her Sunday night, tomorrow, so either I'm gonna be jumping for joy on here on Monday or I'll be making a post I'm ugly crying through, either way you'll all know lol
iijj64,This is a sweet story. It happens sometimes. I know an older couple who were friends and happily married to other people for years. When both of their spouses died, they started hanging out and fell in love. They‚Äôre very happy together.
iijj64,Happened to my grandma, 2 sets of couples that were bestfriends my grandad died and the wife from the other couple and they ended up together and married till he eventually died
iijj64,I‚Äôm not reading any of the other advice because I don‚Äôt want to read anything that will change my mind. I am so rooting for you! I hope with my whole soft fuzzy heart that this is what is meant to be for you! How beautiful if these tragic beginnings could lead to a solid, lovely, renewal! Best wishes to you, 0727, I am praying for a positive update in the near future!!
iijj64,Another stranger hoping for a good update today.
kmiu1k,Things that arent signs of a slob: leaving windows open for days  during a rain storm, washing clothes in the sink and leaving them there, leaving out sandwich making stuff for days, clogging multiple toilets in a short time frame and leaving them(he is forgetting to flush and just reusing the same water without flushing), thinking MLMers are your friends.He needs to be evaluated for dementia.Edit: these are all signs of starting a task, forgetting what you are doing, and abandoning it.
kmiu1k,This. Your dad is either the biggest bastard going, or more than likely has something wrong with his mind. To be that out of it with reality as his age is a worrying sign. It's best to get this checked out ASAP. And if it is Dementia or something along the same lines, there are places catered to caring for people with those conditions.
kmiu1k,Yes. Exactly this. These things all sound like similar symptoms of a CBC program I was listening to yesterday where a former cabinet minister described her experience with her 50year old husband who was eventually diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer‚Äôs (or something to the tune of that name). What OP has described are all similar scenarios she‚Äôs encountered with her husband‚Äî the reason Op should take action for dementia assessment immediately is because physical violence can occur as the disease progresses.Definitely not just a case of ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a slob‚Äù and it‚Äôs time to wake everyone up, OP
kmiu1k,From a child who lost their father to dementia and missed the early signs, meeting him with frustration rather than compassion, big this.
kmiu1k,I have to chime in here and say that my mom is a born-late-surprise-baby nurse and provided in-home care to my grandmother with dementia as long as she feasibly could, and I was expected to help. This sounds like dementia to me. It‚Äôs a hard road, but I think evaluation and possible in home care is the way forward here, rather than eviction.
kmiu1k,Yeah, the washing the clothes in the sink is what tipped me off that something else is going on.  Thats not lazy or slovenly, thats just bizarre.
kmiu1k,Very true. However there's no way to distinguish dementia from more acute or subacute cognitive impairment from this post. It's possible he was cognitively intact two weeks ago but developed an infection and is encephalopathic right now. So many reasons someone could have altered mental status. In any case, this person needs urgent medical evaluation.
kmiu1k,Probably dementia, but sounds like me with depression sometimes too. Some tasks have just been REALLY BIG - like laundry, cleaning the kitchen, etc. This year has been rough and having depression hasn't helped. Many people  don't really understand depression and think they are fine mentally and then do stuff like this without realizing it's an actual brain problem.
kmiu1k,Agreed on this. I know you said your dad has always been a slob and is generally with it mentally but these signs are very similar to those that my mom (71) presented with before (and after) her recent dementia diagnosis. Worth looking into
kmiu1k,Reminds me of one of the dementia patients i work with. From like a quick glance she seems like she can handle herself, but she kinda gets confused while doing things. We have to remind her to clean up after herself and to take a shower and things like that.You dad might just be declining in health the older he gets. It might be time to take him to a doctor or maybe assisted living if he's putting a strain on you. There's no shame in needing help.
kmiu1k,May I ask what MLM stands for? I'm assuming it is something to do within America?Edit: thankyou to the 10 or more people that replied so quickly, I understand now. For clarification I thought MLM might have been some sort of group against the BLM movement but that is definitely not the case.
kmiu1k,As someone who has an 80 year old father that does stuff like this - it isn't dementia, he just has zero fucks left to give. He literally couldn't care less anymore, and he doesn't have the energy to put forth to try caring. He lives with us and it's like having a kid. Cooks eggs and leaves the eggs out. Finishes cereal and leaves the empty boxes out. Keeps adding trash to an already full trash can, letting it overflow. Leaves plates and stuff out, nothing gets rinsed off. Hasn't cleaned anything in the 2+ years he's been here, except rarely washing dishes. He bathes maybe once every week or two. Smells like pee all the time. But he's 100% cognizant. He drives, goes shopping, handles all his meds and medical appointments, keeps up with his friends and family members, etc. He's all there upstairs, he just doesn't care.
kmiu1k,I also agree with this.Sounds like a lot of very odd habits in a short time which could reflect a lack of wellness.TY
kmiu1k,I came here to say this as well. I think you should get your dad checked out. Sure he may have been sloppy all his life, but some of the things you named are not normal. Or maybe his sloppiness have been building over the years due to mental deterioration. My mom who suffers from dementia started off leaving out food for days at a time because she would start preparing something and then forget about it. Then the toilets clogged because she would forget to flush it after using it. She would break appliances because she would start using them and forget about it or use them improperly because she is over using them. This happened slowly over the course of a couple years before she finally agreed to see a doctor with me.
kmiu1k,You forgot hoarding.But otherwise I agree; not much of what OP recounted could be attributed to someone being a regular asshole.He needs to go get evaluated by a neurologist. And begin the social services process of having the issue quantified, so that eventually, when the dementia progresses to the point OP cannot take care of him (which I'd argue is now already, unless he's willing forego vacations from now on), he can be taken to a care home.More than that, though; I don't know the history between Op and his dad, but he needs to stop being angry, confrontational, and blaming towards him.
kmiu1k,He said this isn‚Äôt anything new though and his Dad has ‚Äúalways‚Äù been like this. Not sure so much about dementia
nyc49t,It sounds like your boyfriend hasn't told her directly not to talk to him or to leave him alone, which will probably be the gym staff's first suggestion depending on their level of proactiveness on member comfort before intervening themselves.  I know this can be challenging and uncomfortable, so going with him or recruiting a friend of his to go along might help here.  Practicing what he will say at home with you could help make it easier too, in the heat of the moment it can be easy to forget or feel overwhelmed.  Things like "I prefer to workout alone/not socialize at the gym/stay focused, thanks for understanding" (the thanks at the end assumes she will take it on board which can make it harder for them to raise a fuss). Headphones can help discourage people too. She is definitely out of line.
nyc49t,This, except more direct ‚Äúyou‚Äôre making me uncomfortable. Please stop.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI am not interested in cheating or making a new friend or whatever it is you want from me, please stop.‚Äù Or even ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk to you, so please leave me alone.‚ÄùAlso because he is a dude, he should tell staff that she has been bugging him and he is going to ask her to back off. Because otherwise she can say he was harassing her and they‚Äôll probably believe her and it may affect his standing at the gym.
nyc49t,Here's a helpful comment OP. My friends Fiance is super shy so she got a few workout shirts made that say "I JUST WANNA WORK OUT" and he wears headphones and points to his shirt if anyone comes up to him. Most of the time people heed the shirt.
nyc49t,My best friend wears headphones and ignores people.  blatant disrespect there on her part saying he looks like he would cheat I'd be pissed. I would just tell her "sorry I came here to work out not make friends and cheat on my gf like you seem to think I look like I'd be willing to do, spoiler alert not in this life time or the next."
nyc49t,Yes. You don't get her to stop talking to him. He does.
nyc49t,This is bf's issue to handle.  Not OP's issue to manage.  The fact that OP is posting about an issue her boyfriend has with setting boundaries is concerning to me.  I completely get that bf seems to be conflict-avoidant, but it does't seem healthy if the two of them want to go down the path that OP is taking responsibility for bf's difficult interactions.A lot of times people write in here because some third person is encroaching on their SO,  the SO does nothing, and the usual response is you don't have a "third person problem, you have an SO problem."  Here the bf is being harassed/made uncomfortable by someone at his gym.  It should be up to bf to say - "Hey, I'm not interested. I want to be polite, but no thanks."  If that doesn't work, then he should talk to gym staff.But I'm still concerned that OP is taking the lead here and asking what "we" should do about a situation that is bf's to manage.  There may be situations in the future where bf needs to act on his own and that "we" isn't available.
nyc49t,Authority can solve this, he should be dominant and say that he does not want to talk to her.
nyc49t,He has to tell her he‚Äôs not interested and wants her to leave him alone - point blank.
nyc49t,I'm baffled that it's this fucking hard to grasp. You don't have to talk to other people, tell them to leave you alone. If they don't, then that's when you get authorities involved whether that's the management at a private business or the civil authorities.
nyc49t,I cannot believe shit like this gets posted on advice forums on the internet.The solution is to say ‚ÄúHey, please don‚Äôt do this anymore‚Äù and stop interacting with the person. How socially uncomfortable do they need to be for both OP and her boyfriend to not know how to handle this situation?
nyc49t,It sounds like he went with "I have a girlfriend" which is fine.  She said something stupid and they parted ways.I'm not sure why OP thinks this woman is going to approach him again.  This is how social interactions work.   Someone approaches you, you reject them, they act shitty and then leave you alone.It's already over....
nyc49t,If that doesn‚Äôt work then he needs to tell the gym management. Harassment is a thing they probably have to deal with a few times a year.
nyc49t,What most women do is keep the ear phones on and ignore everyone else around them.  If she tries to talk, one word answers, followed up quickly with "Sorry, I am in a rush and need to get my work out done."
nyc49t,Sometimes I like to wear a hat, helps me focus and makes it harder for people to get your attention and come up with an excuse to ‚Äúchat‚Äù.But OP‚Äôs bf sounds like he should learn that it‚Äôs absolutely okay to establish boundaries and start practicing. This girl seems like a great place to start. They‚Äôll both get over it, it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre (or at least he) at the gym to make friends.
nyc49t,I have AirPods for going to the store. I block out everyone, but I don‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm wearing any audio.When I go to the gym, I wear my big, white and gold beats. Instantly blocks people from conversation. When I forget, I do get unsolicited advice, comments, and questions.
nti1h4,How utterly devastating. You've handled yourself really well, and believe me when I tell you that in the near distant future you'll be able to look back on this whole episode without pain, and you'll actually feel proud of how you handled yourself during a time of such hurt, betrayal, confusion and pain.You've done so well to retain your empathy and ability to look at the bigger picture through this trauma, and these qualities will serve you well as you gain distance and perspective.The pain will slowly diminish with each passing day until one day in a year or two you'll end up in a conversation about exes, and realize you'd forgotten him, and that when you discuss the break up it will be in terms of how you prevented his other gf from being deceived by this cheating liar.
nti1h4,I hope so. I appreciate your kindness and I hope in the future he‚Äôll feel like a lil speck. Thank you
nti1h4,You've done so well to retain your empathy and ability to look at the bigger picture through this trauma, and these qualities will serve you well as you gain distance and perspective.For real, I doubt I would've handled that situation so maturely at that age. Bravo OP!
nti1h4,When he comes crawling back (and believe me babe, he will) you shoot me a message and I‚Äôll venmo you money for a drink on me. So proud of you girl.
nti1h4,This is the sweetest. Thank you hahaha I appreciate your kindness and the sentiment <3
nti1h4,Same!!! Both of OP‚Äôs posts are very mature, clear, and empathetic. She recognizes her hurt, but is directing her anger and pain at the right person, and approached the ‚Äúother woman‚Äù in a respectful way. OP deserves a man with integrity that matches hers. WHEN her ex comes crawling back, I‚Äôm totally sending $ for drinks with girlfriends!
nti1h4,This is truly one of the sweetest replies I‚Äôve ever come across.
nti1h4,This is the coolest, you're amazing and have inspired me to do the same for my friends if they're going through something :)
nti1h4,We need more people like you honestly cause mos of society don't realize that cheaters are manipulative and use it as their advantage to get another partner. Most of the time affair partner is blamed even though they had no knowledge that they were the side partners.May you get a loving partner because that's what you deserve
nti1h4,I agree, wouldn‚Äôt have felt right directing my anger at her. Was all his fault. Thank you, I appreciate your kindness x
nti1h4,Super annoying when people say it's none of your business to tell someone they're being cheated on. I think that's messed up to to not tell a person that. It's almost a responsibility imo
nti1h4,Proud of you. Take care of you now- entirely. Self love, trips, hobbies, etc. You‚Äôre a gem and deserve all the good things.
nti1h4,Thank you, absolutely all the self love needed.
nti1h4,Great job getting rid of him and realizing it is NOT your fault.  Sometimes those that put on the best fronts are the biggest pieces of garbage.  And one day he will grow up and either have that happen to him or realize the pain he caused.  I'm sorry you went thru that hurt but hell ya for moving forward
nti1h4,He is a big piece of garbage haha with a very very good front. Scary. Thank you for your kindness and I hope he grows up soon before he hurts someone else
nti1h4,Something that sticks out to me is just how dang cowardly your ex was.He didn‚Äôt take any responsibility for his choices and he clearly didn‚Äôt even want to be with the other girl. Like he was cheating on you with someone he didn‚Äôt even like that much and had convinced himself that he somehow wasn‚Äôt responsible for it and didn‚Äôt have a choice?He thanked YOU for revealing the truth to the other woman. He was RELIEVED that she would probably break up with him and it wouldn‚Äôt be his fault.He didn‚Äôt even love her? He wasn‚Äôt concerned that it would ruin his potential happy ever after with her: he was scared that it would be his fault if she became suicidal. Once it was someone else pulling the trigger he didn‚Äôt give a crap about her mental health.Just‚Ä¶ goddamn. Glad you saw his true colours when you did and I wish you all the best moving on from him and trusting yourself and others in the future.
nti1h4,That‚Äôs what‚Äôs sticking out to me too. His behaviour when I called him too, when I asked if he loved her ‚Äúyeah I tell her that because otherwise she‚Äôd cut‚Äù and I keep her happy or she takes it out on me. It seemed like he victimised himself, which confused me immensely. I appreciate your reply, because I feel kinda crazy thinking all these things to myself but someone else pointing it out makes me feel way more stable haha.And thank you - I‚Äôm glad I figured out who he was before tied down more seriously. Thanks for your kindness
ih4r1x,Why do you think you may have upset him? Your fiance knows you've went to therapy for years, regularly. He obviously realised you were in a session when he walked in. I don't think you did anything you need to apologize for, or anything that would've hurt your fiance.
ih4r1x,If anything he probably feels embarassed and awkward he walked in on her private time. OP, you did nothing wrong, but it might make sense to have a shared calendar with your fiance which includes your therapy sessions so he knows to be out of the house.
ih4r1x,I'm wondering what OP said that fianc√© overheard.
ih4r1x,Don't forget how easy it is to hurt someone's ego. I read it like the ex is still somehow spooking (nothing abnormal!) and it might be taken as "is she still not over him/her?".You shouldn't apologize but try to make him understand that's it's intimate and private. Also ask if he heard anything that might worry him, add that it might sound weird taken out of context like that.
ih4r1x,If it were me,  I may have coughed on purpose so that you knew I'd be walking near the room in case you wanted to keep what you're saying private from me. That was my first thought since he also turned on the podcast, possibly to assure you that he wasn't overhearing you. Definitely speak to him about it when he comes home though, and I hope whatever he has to say will ease your mind.
ih4r1x,UPDATE:So as many of you speculated, I was being overly anxious. I didn't hear from fiance for awhile, but it turned out that he was busy. After coming home, everything seemed to be fine. He then asked how my day was, and I just blurted out what I outlined in the OP. I told him that when he got home I was in the middle of a therapist appointment. He said he figured that out pretty quickly after he first saw me, left the room and put on the podcast while making lunch in hopes that I wouldn't feel self conscious for the rest of the appt. I mentioned that I heard him in close proximity the room at one point and felt a little anxious that he may have heard something that upset him. He said that he did go to the bathroom (closer to the room I was in) and that he could hear me, but any words were inaudible.The bottom line is that he wasn't upset, if anything, a momentary tinge of awkwardness. He said that he feels positive that I care enough about myself to try to work things out in therapy. From now on, he knows when my appointments are so will try to make himself scarce during these 40 minutes for my own peace of mind.One thing I do want to address is that I have not been seeing one therapist for 10 years. In fact, I've seen a few, due to relocation, changes in employment/insurance coverage, and in one case it was a bad fit. It's not uncommon for people to change primary care doctors over the course of a decade and this isn't much different. As to why I posted on Reddit afterward: I was curious about what people thought. It's not abnormal to want insight from people in a non-professional setting.As far as therapy not working because I've been going for a decade, and those who think my talking about ex means I'm not over him: the damage incurred by PTSD (in my case via physical/emotional)v abuse is something that will never be entirely "fixable" and I don't really know what to say to anyone who tries to argue otherwise.
ih4r1x,Your fiance is really nice, and it's very good that now he knows when that is to make you feel comfortable. Maybe he'll find the time some day to go too.And anyone who thinks that you weren't over your ex when you clearly said you were voicing out some abusive behavior that caused the PTSD and think is that easy to get over it have clearly never been to therapy
ih4r1x,I like it when things have a happy ending.What I came to say was even if you had been in therapy for ten years; it doesn‚Äôt matter.Therapy is not a one size fits all. There are so many different avenues to go with so many different types it‚Äôs unreal.Sometimes you can‚Äôt connect with a therapist and it won‚Äôt work. Sometimes you‚Äôre not in the right place. Sometimes the therapist is bad. Sometimes there‚Äôs a multitude of issues which you can only deal with in small doses and one at a time. Don‚Äôt let ANY one tell you therapy isn‚Äôt working and you ‚Äòshould be over‚Äô shit. That‚Äôs your decision about your mental health. If anything it shows you are self aware enough to recognise you need support; which is fine. If more people reached out for that kind of support the world would be a better place.Good luck; and hold your head high. You got this :-)
ih4r1x,It's absolutely baffling to me that anyone would balk at long-term therapy.  I've heard this perspective even from very well read & otherwise highly logical individuals.  It really speaks to the societal (and in turn, individual) ignorance and misconceptions around neurobiology. Even setting aside any medical need, I'd want to see a therapist at least a few times a year.  There's just way too much personal growth & emotional intelligence that I'd be missing out on otherwise! (Also, considering the recent developments in the research world, I'm guessing it won't be long before they demonstrate that therapy actually decreases, or at least delays, Alzheimer's/Dementia)
ih4r1x,This is the problem with going to reddit. You get a lot of morons that think they know everything, dissecting your life based on a few sentences.Ps: the morons are the ones downvoting this comment!
ih4r1x,In regards to your last point, one time a friend of mine was speaking judgmentally about another friend of hers. Something like "And she's been in therapy for years, so obviously it's not working. I don't think anyone should be in therapy for years."And I said, "I've been therapy off and on for years and likely will for the rest of my life.""Well, yeah. But that makes sense for you..."Frankly, I hate that mindset. Yes, I'll likely need therapy off and on for the rest of my life, due to substantial developmental and sexual trauma.But also? The world is hard and fucked up and even those who escape childhood without trauma have been taught all sorts of messed up things and can use the support of a trained and empathetic ear who can help them work through things and build their coping kit. It's just stigma, that relatively progressive, pro-therapy people buy into.
ih4r1x,Glad to hear all is well!I'm a therapist, and I've been going to therapy myself since I was 18. I've seen different therapists due to moving as well. It's not uncommon for people with years & years of trauma and/or untreated mental health issues, to seek therapy long term. As a therapist, I'm just happy when someone is willing to talk about hard things and work on themselves, regardless of how long it may be.
ih4r1x,I only came to say that it seemed obvious this was your anxiety talking. I‚Äôd probably discuss this whole episode with your therapist to see what you might do differently next time because the fact you thought you may have upset him enough to write a reddit post seems a bit odd to me
ih4r1x,Therapy works, and I agree wholeheartedly with you. I have been clean of opiates 12 years as of 2 days ago and I still do outpatient therapy every 2-3 months. Its likely that I may always go. And that's ok because it helps to keep you on track with your progress. Sending healing serene vibes your way.
ih4r1x,As far as therapy not working because I've been going for a decade, and those who think my talking about ex means I'm not over him: the damage incurred by PTSD (in my case via physical/emotional)v abuse is something that will never be entirely "fixable" and I don't really know what to say to anyone who tries to argue otherwise.You don't say a dang thing, sister. Just give them the hand and move along.
ih4r1x,Have you thought about getting one of those white noise machines? You can get one on amazon. Just in case he‚Äôs unable to leave the apt, this way you‚Äôll both feel comfortable that you won‚Äôt be overheard. I find that if someone blares music while I‚Äôm in session, I listen to the music so I got one of those. In order to further cancel the sound of my voice, I also ask the person to either put the tv on a low volume, or use headphones to listen to a podcast or music. Just a thought.I always find it interesting when people think you go to therapy for a fixed amount of time and you‚Äôre fixed. You‚Äôre constantly evolving and changing (sometimes for the better & sometimes for the worse) as you face new situations. Especially with conditions such as PTSD, it‚Äôs good to go to therapy in order to manage your anxiety and not let things build up. You should switch your therapist every few years to get a new perspective, to further challenge yourself, & a good therapist knows that.
hzkdbw,Don't put it on your partner. For the time being, whenever she brings it up, you say "Asked and Answered. We are not having guests during a pandemic." Do NOT give her a bunch of reasons or justifications as to why, those only give her something to shoot down so that she gets her way. If you're going to learn to say No to your mother, you have to learn to be unmoved by her guilt trips. Caring about someone does not give them a free pass to do whatever they want. Love and boundaries are not mutually exclusive, you can have both. Time to be firm.Next, you furnish your office as your office. Period. If the time comes when travel and visiting is once again feasible, you don't have a bed for her. (She will say "But you said you were going to get a pull-out sofa for me!" which you did not. Don't take the bait.)
hzkdbw,I like this to be perfectly honest. I am dealing with a friend who constantly wants to hang out at my house or his house on Saturdays AFTER we've already hung out in public. I don't want to do it. I am just going to repeat every single week "Yeah I just am being cautious with COVID."And the office thing? Do exactly what you planned on doing. Don't add anything extra on account of your mother. That just gives her the sense that she's welcome all the time.But most of all...you have to learn to be unmoved by her guilt trips.100% agree with this. What you've described sounds incredibly over-bearing. And what you're saying sounds incredibly reasonable. It sucks when your parents are divorced and alone and older, but you're the child. Until she is physically unable, it's not your responsibility to take care of her.
hzkdbw,Don't put it on your partner.I wasn‚Äôt planning on doing that, don‚Äôt worry! I understand that it sounds like I was considering it, though.I just brought it up because I‚Äôm frustrated that she won‚Äôt take no for an answer. I guess I was thinking out loud, wondering if she‚Äôd respect the word ‚Äúno‚Äù  more if it came from my partner‚Äôs mouth instead of mine. I wouldn‚Äôt put that on him though!(She will say "But you said you were going to get a pull-out sofa for me!" which you did not. Don't take the bait.)Oh boy. This sounds like my mom. Except she‚Äôd push me by trying to pay for it, first. I‚Äôll be careful about this, thanks for the warning.
hzkdbw,This is called JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain) this is explained more in depth in the justnomil subreddit and few others already mentioned. There's tons of good books on boundaries and when I have more time, I can look up some titles I have, or if others want to mention some. A big motto is that no is a complete sentence. "No, we already talked about this, I won't discuss it further." "No, that doesn't work for me." Once you learn key ways to avoid manipulation it becomes way easier to manage.
hzkdbw,Caring about someone does not give them a free pass to do whatever they want. Love and boundaries are not mutually exclusive, you can have both.Say it louder for the people in the back!!!
hzkdbw,This. Small note though: "I do not have a bed for you". Is not the same thing as "I do not have a spare bed".If there are people you want as house guests, dogs in the home fee is a great idea. Having our doesn't require you to let people use it. Even your mother.
hzkdbw,I think this is great if op is happy to have no contact with her mother. If I'd love 8 h away from close family I'd expect them to host me for visits, but that's obviously close family I have a good relationship with. If they refuse, then I guess I won't see them.
hzkdbw,Okay bad news: you're going to have to tell your mother a firm no, and she's going to be hurt and going to guilt trip you for it.This is unavoidable.  So start getting yourself into a headspace where you're prepared for the fact that it is NOT the end of the world?Think of it this way- she would be happiest with you and her having a great relationship.  If you have to do things that make her temporarily unhappy, in aid of a life where you're a mother and daughter, not a juggernaut and a doormat.I'd start practicing some scripts.  "Actually mom we've found it really doesn't work for us to have guests in the office- but I'm going to book you into a great airbnb right near us."  "It's really sweet of you to want to visit- but now is a terrible time.  What about [alternate date that is genuinely the next time you'd like to see her]?"  "No, we're not going for a sofa bed- we don't plan on using the room for company, it's going to be desks, bookcases, filing cabinets, etc."  "I'm really sorry to hear that.  Please let me know if you change your mind."
hzkdbw,Yeah, I think OP is looking for a magic bullet that will shut her mom down without her Mom trying to make her feel bad. Ain't going to happen. She needs to reinforce the boundary and steel herself for the hurt feelings and manipulation.
hzkdbw,she‚Äôs going to be hurtShe‚Äôs going to act like she‚Äôs ‚Äúhurt‚Äù because she‚Äôs always gotten her way by weaponizing her ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù.‚ÄúNo‚Äù is not rude. If you tell someone ‚Äúno‚Äù and they get upset that doesn‚Äôt mean you should‚Äôve said ‚Äúyes‚Äù. And changing your ‚Äúno‚Äù to a ‚Äúyes‚Äù just to soothe their feelings means you‚Äôre sacrificing yourself, your life, and your happiness to prioritize theirs. That‚Äôs unhealthy and not sustainable.OP, your mom is ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù with money because that‚Äôs the coin she spends in order to keep control. You and your partner have a new house, you‚Äôre fully within your rights to decide there will be no overnight guests. And instead of giving logical reasons for her to pick apart, just tell her: No, we‚Äôre not set up for hosting overnight guests. No, we won‚Äôt be doing that. No thank you, that doesn‚Äôt work for us.
hzkdbw,Boundaries, boundaries, boundaries! (check out r/raisedbynarcissists or r/justnoMIL for some info and tips from those in your shoes on setting boundaries with unhealthy family members)Every time you give an inch, she takes a mile. Why do you think she's so "generous" and wants to pay for everything? Because then you're dependent on her and/or you "owe" her and it's harder to say no to someone who's paying your rent/tuition/etc.I'd start by telling her the truth and establishing the boundary at the same time: "Mom, I've been thinking about our conversation regarding your birthday and I'm just not comfortable with you coming to visit next month and I'm not sure when I will be due to the virus and my health issues. I need you to know that your repeated requests to visit have felt like pressure at best and manipulative at worst, and whether intentional or not I can't continue to worry about having to tell you "no" all the time. Moving forward, I will have to end our conversations and hang up if you insist on bringing up these topics or discussing them when I've made it clear I'm not interested."Then follow through: if she asks to visit, lays on the guilt-trip, or pressures you then just hang up the phone/zoom call/stop responding to the texts.
hzkdbw,Wish I could up vote this more than once, this advice is spot on. Lay down your boundaries and stick to them OP, exactly as you would with a poorly behaved child. Maybe also check out the "Grey rock" technique for dealing with overly dramatic/emotionally manipulative people.It's really hard to start doing this but it will get easier as you practice, and as your mum (and her enablers) realise that you wont put up with such poor behaviour anymore.Well done for recognizing what your gut is telling you - make sure to listen to it! Xx
hzkdbw,I'd start by telling her the truth and establishing the boundary at the same time: "Mom, I've been thinking about our conversation regarding your birthday and I'm just not comfortable with you coming to visit next month and I'm not sure when I will be due to the virus and my health issues. I need you to know that your repeated requests to visit have felt like pressure at best and manipulative at worst, and whether intentional or not I can't continue to worry about having to tell you "no" all the time. Moving forward, I will have to end our conversations and hang up if you insist on bringing up these topics or discussing them when I've made it clear I'm not interested."Pretty much everything except the part where I‚Äôd call her manipulative sounds good to me. I know that she freaks out if someone insinuates she‚Äôs being manipulative or lying. But ‚Äúpressure‚Äù is a good word. I‚Äôll definitely be using that.The next time she asks, I‚Äôll tell her she‚Äôs applying unreasonable pressure and that it‚Äôs making me uncomfortable because it feels like I can‚Äôt tell her no.Something like, ‚ÄúI know how excited you are to visit me, but can you imagine what kind of position your excitement would put me in if I had to say no for some reason? I‚Äôd be so worried about letting you down that I‚Äôd never tell you what I was really thinking.‚Äù (Then once she agrees to that, which I think she will, I can say ‚Äúwell, that‚Äôs the position you‚Äôre putting me in right now!‚Äù)I can follow that up by saying something like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to me that we can communicate honestly, and when you keep asking me to change my mind about visiting/apply pressure, it‚Äôs hard for me to be honest with you. Let‚Äôs work on that, okay?‚Äù She always talks about the importance of honesty, so I‚Äôd be trapping her with one of her professed values.If/when she violates that gentle suggestion and continues to push, I‚Äôll get more explicit with the boundaries. I think that it might help to start her off slow, so that she doesn‚Äôt instantly freak out. Plus, this way, I can point back to the earlier, gentle conversation, and say ‚ÄúTsk, we talked about this!‚ÄùIf she keeps going, you‚Äôre right, I do need to go nonresponsive. I‚Äôve already been nervously taking too long to respond to her texts, so that isn‚Äôt too hard!Thank you for the advice! :)
hzkdbw,This OP! This.Also learn to use the BLOCK ability your phone come with. I am not above blocking anyone who won‚Äôt leave me alone. It‚Äôs so freeing
hzkdbw,This is exactly what I would comment. Your mother doesn't have a right to just claim a space in your house, and then be insistent when you've basically said no and told her what your plans are. Sometimes, you don't accept gifts from your parents because they are using them to exert more control over you (by guilting, usually). And you don't have to let her stay there if you know she goes through your things and your partner is also uncomfortable with her being there. Create boundaries and then stick to them.
hzkdbw,She‚Äôs constantly offering to give me money I don‚Äôt need, and she tries to lend a helping hand in every situation without being asked. She has offered to pay for graduate school for me and pay for my living expenses, because she wants me back in school.What you call being giving and generous is just an extension of her being pushy.For now, you can blame it on the virus. But you're going to have to get used to saying no to her, and then ignoring her temper tantrums. She will get worse before she gets better - she will try to test your resolve.
hzkdbw,What you call being giving and generous is just an extension of her being pushy.On some level, I know this. That said, I still mostly don‚Äôt know it.I‚Äôve accepted so much from my mother, without even thinking. She spoiled me with material goods, heck, she even went so far as to sign away half ownership of her home to me. (I‚Äôm supposed to inherit it, and she said I‚Äôd save money on taxes if I partially owned it before then, so I went along with it even though it just entangled us further.) From the way she talks about me, you‚Äôd think I was the reason the sun rose in the morning.Sure, I guess it‚Äôs kind of like that thing cults do, ‚Äúlovebombing‚Äù. But cults wouldn‚Äôt do it if it didn‚Äôt work!How can I turn my back on all that love, and deny my mother the right to see me and talk to me whenever she wants? Sure, she wants too much, but she‚Äôs given me too much. She‚Äôs sacrificed for me, so don‚Äôt I deserve to be unhappy on her behalf? (These thoughts then send me into a self-doubt spiral, in which I ruminate on what a bad person I am.)I understand that she is trying to control me, but she has been so selfless toward me that it feels like I kind of deserve it. It‚Äôs as though I didn‚Äôt deserve her kindness, and paying for it by giving up my agency is appropriate compensation.
hzkdbw,OP also has to stop accepting these gifts. I used to accept excessive gifts from my manipulative mother because I thought refusing them would hurt her feelings. The reality is that accepting them gave her yet another thing to hold over my head to get what she wanted. I just stopped accepting.I'm NC with my mom now and occasionally, like at Christmas, I'll get a check in the mail for something like $100. It gets voided and goes straight in the shredder.
k6jeuj,Oh dear Germans for some reason love sauna and when someone says they have never been it's quite common to offer it.
k6jeuj,I appreciate the frankness. I kinda expected this but maybe was subconciously hoping it was more...
k6jeuj,Have you never been to Finland?
k6jeuj,German here. Really not the case that much. Only  in specific circles. I never went to a Sauna in my life and Im a native german.
k6jeuj,Can confirm, it's pretty normal here.
k6jeuj,Am German, never heard that before.
k6jeuj,As an American, I CANNOT IMAGINE THIS. The entire concept of inviting an acquaintance to come hang out with you all sweaty and naked just seems like asking for trouble. I mean, I know Americans have a reputation for being rather puritanical, but is this just a normal thing everywhere else?
k6jeuj,It's not at all appropriate to start any sexual banter in the sauna (from the blue, at least), since everyone is in the nude. For the same reason, asking someone to go to sauna really shouldn't be seen as asking them out for a date, unless it's explicitly stated.
k6jeuj,Exactly. Germans love sauna and us (not me I hate it) it's such a common thing to invite friends to
k6jeuj,Now I know ;-)
k6jeuj,"Schau dir meine lustigen Teile an und sieh dir deine lustigen Teile an, aber keine Ber√ºhrung von lustigen Teilen..."
k6jeuj,German female here and I'm shocked/embarrassed by many of these comments. Inviting you to the sauna was not sexual at all. It's not a place you'd take someone on a first date, but it's perfectly fine when you're going with friends. Which is what you've clearly become for her, a friend. She probably told you about the date, because she was excited and wanted to tell a friend. Some people said that she was testing you and you wouldn't hang out with a coworker after hours. What a bunch of crap. I hang out with my coworkers all the time because some of them are also my friends. And I don't think she was testing you in any way. She is a 29 year old grown woman and probably a little too mature for such childish games. Quarantine has been difficult for all of us, which is why friends are needed. So please, try to be a good friend to her and don't read too much into what she is doing.
k6jeuj,If the comments here shock you then don't read the original. People suggesting that he invite her over to the "sauna" at his house, or whether nudity would be okay without the sauna. Ergh.I say this as a female, sauna loving Brit.
k6jeuj,Ughhh this comment should be at the very top!! I feel second-hand embarassment and grossed from some comments telling OP that his coworker was just ‚Äûplaying games‚Äú and ‚Äûflirting‚Äú with him... Wer the hell w√ºrde f√ºr ein Date in die Sauna gehen!!! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
k6jeuj,I also wouldn't recommend looking for a possible partner at work. It's only gonna get awkward if it ends badly
k6jeuj,I am now curious, if you wouldn't mind explaining the social nuance here. Is it common to invite coworkers to a sauna as the first activity you do outside of work together? It's hard for me to imagine that the average casual friend at the workplace jumps straight into "let's get naked together" rather than starting with "let's have a beer together" or whatever. My impression is that being nude at a sauna together is something established friends and family members do together in a purely platonic way. Is there really no social boundary there at all? People go with absolutely anyone, no matter how casual and distant their connection is?I am also curious, are Germans completely unaware that some other countries find nudity to be intimate? Like, would you invite an American man you work with to go to the sauna together and not have the slightest awareness that he might think it is a signal you are interested in him?
hro3xn,Tell him he better be able to get a virtual girlfriend on it to sleep on the floor with him
hro3xn,Tell him he better be able to get a virtual girlfriendRedundant, real gamers don‚Äôt need girlfriends.
hro3xn,I second this. How is this snarky little comment not at the top? If it was me in her situation, this is exactly what I'd say. I'm not even sarcastic.
hro3xn,I second this. Bullsh**
hro3xn,he was dismantling the bed when you were away so he could finish the job before you got there, so that you‚Äôd be powerless. he doesn‚Äôt care about your opinion enough to talk about it with you..or enough to use his own common sense!? he definitely needs a good shake up, you‚Äôve got to give him an ultimatum cos he‚Äôs acting like a child so he needs to get treated like one really. because currently it seems like he thinks his actions don‚Äôt have consequences, so you have to show him they do.
hro3xn,What sort of ultimatum will really get him to wake up? I mean I threatened to throw the damn thing out the window and it barely registered
hro3xn,My child father did this to my posturepedic bed... He didnt like it or the frame. So he bought a cheap frame and a memory foam mattress HE wanted... I slept on my couches since. Hopefully moving out soon.
hro3xn,Sounds like you're dating a child. Is this the first time he's selfish done something like this?
hro3xn,No our relationship has always been amazing and we always discuss and decide everything together. This is why it feels so insane to not be able to sit down and have a serious discussion without just being told that "you'll love vr it's amazing" or "you can use it to exercise and socialise too"
hro3xn,Oh honey, I get you. My boyfriend got an oculus rift when they very first came out, I think he even preordered it. For 6+ months it was non stop VR is going to change our lives/the world, soon EVERYTHING is going to be available in VR etc. then it came, he put it in the living room originally, all the furniture had to be moved when he wanted to play, plus it‚Äôs wired so try not tripping over everything when your playing. I hated it, but his house that we live in is large enough to get away from it if I needed to, it doesn‚Äôt sound like you have that option. Thankfully he eventually realized that it was incredibly cumbersome and in the way and he moved it to his office. I can‚Äôt remember the last time he used it, but I‚Äôm betting it was at least a year ago if not more.I know he still loves VR but the tech just isn‚Äôt where he wanted it to be and as soon as it is he will be back on it and we‚Äôre going to have to make sure that it‚Äôs not dominating a shared space, we‚Äôve talked about finding a house with a basement so he can have a gaming space that is also able to have guests easily hang out in.I would just have a conversation, tell him you‚Äôre not attacking his hobby but that you‚Äôre not willing to change your life drastically for it. He‚Äôs really young and probably hasn‚Äôt had to be very considerate of someone else to this degree before and he‚Äôs gotta learn now that he doesn‚Äôt get to dismantle a shared space without approval of the people sharing it. If he takes it poorly and insists well then it‚Äôs in your court, do you want to be with someone who unilaterally decides important things? (A bedroom setup is pretty important). You‚Äôre not his mom, you don‚Äôt get to tell him what to do but both of your should be trying to work it out while taking the other persons wants into consideration. It called compromise and your both going to have to do some of this if the relationship continues.He has to understand if he doesn‚Äôt have access to a space that‚Äôs just his he doesn‚Äôt get 100% say.Also don‚Äôt throw it out, destroy it etc. that makes you a way bigger jerk, you have no right to destroy/give away his property. The only leverage you have is your willingness to continue a relationship with him. I know you think you‚Äôre stuck but you‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs hard to leave without support but what happens if he hurts you? Cheats on you? Stops bathing and hordes 50+ cats? You need an exit plan always.Start looking into rooms for rent and other housing options. It‚Äôs not impossible to even find a room to share not just rent on your own if money is that tight. Being free of a bad relationship is worth the hardship it takes to do it.The worst thing you can do for yourself is to let the other person know that you have no choice but to stay. Once they know that they know they can do a bunch of not ok stuff because you aren‚Äôt going to leave. Never let anyone think they have you on their hook no matter what. You are probably a wonderful person who deserves love and respect and shouldn‚Äôt settle for someone who only gives you one of those things.Ride or die is only for people who truly have your back and are willing to work out whatever comes along, not just one dictating how it‚Äôs going to be and the other person has to fall in line.
hro3xn,I really hope she reads this, it's spot on
hro3xn,Exactly I hope she reads this.They both dont really understand but VR although amazing is just not as amazing as everyone thinks. You just cannot play it for extended sessions. Its not a relaxing experience.  Its akin to working out even. Really hope she reads your comment.
hro3xn,Well written, nuanced, beautiful answer
hro3xn,Gatdayum this is good advice.
hro3xn,Love this. It's about knowing your partner. If this is truly out of character for him, I would just give it a little time to let the bloom fall off the rose.
hro3xn,Thankfully, some goddamn level headed answer, all these answer just go in these messed up slippery slopes how he is a horrible person and she must break up with him. The dude is proly just excited and a bit mislead.
nit3wr,I don‚Äôt think this is really about the money. I think that it‚Äôs mostly jealousy towards Amy
nit3wr,Yes. Sarah hasn't dealt with the combining if the two families and is still acting like a young child because if it. She obviously needs some counseling.And so do the parents bc they want to fix things, but are focused on the money issue instead of the jealousy issue....which is probably more if an abandonment/insecurity thing.But no matter what, it's not Sarah's place to expect money from anyone nor to tell her parents how to spend their money.
nit3wr,Ya I was going to say it sounds like a deeper issue regarding her relationship with her father. It could be just jealousy. But it‚Äôs possible something happening in childhood or the dynamics were such that she didn‚Äôt get enough love or attention once the new family move in. It could be either or and I think it would be beneficial for dad to talk to his daughter about how she feels.
nit3wr,My first thought when reading your title was "she needs to get over it. It's your money." But reading the post, it wasn't even your money, it was a gift. You are free to accept gifts as you wish. And your daughter needs to get over it anyway.
nit3wr,Whether it was OP's money is irrelevant. The daughter wants others to subsidize her poor life choices and that's ridiculous.
nit3wr,Yeah, if her sister and parent(s) have been helping her financially for over a year idk why it is unreasonable to believe that her sister could also pay for the trip to see her parents of all people.
nit3wr,A 32 year old married woman has her priorities all wrong. Even if you did pay for that trip...she‚Äôs too old to feel so entitled to daddy‚Äôs money. She needs home truths about being a grown up, solving your own problems and being responsible for yourself more than anything else. Yes it‚Äôs nice to help where possible, but her and her husband can‚Äôt be expecting you to not live your life just because they‚Äôre struggling
nit3wr,Especially since OP has bailed her out already multiple times!
nit3wr,A 32 year old doesn‚Äôt get to tell their father he can‚Äôt visit with his in laws.
nit3wr,Tbh it sounds like deep down she knows her husband is an idiot, but is just focusing her anger at dad for... Name a reason. People do it all the time.
nit3wr,Yeah, this, I'm 32, even when I was younger and definitely just getting by we NEVER asked for money or felt entitled to it. She needs to work this out with her husband and herself.
nit3wr,I wonder if it has less to do with money and more to do with feeling left out. My family has taken vacations with out me and, let me tell you, it‚Äôs really disappointing not to be included or invited in anyway.
nit3wr,This, but I can see her feeling jealous.  I wouldn't but you should sit down w/her and give her an earful.  She's too old for this shit!!
nit3wr,Exactly what I wanted to say.
nit3wr,This is a weird family, it's all about who they married... So obviously they're going to talk to the men that supported them before marriage.
nit3wr,I agree with you on some parts, but even money aside if the rest of my family went on a trip without me I'd feel pretty bad.This post definitely smacks of entitlement but also I do think it's reasonable to be upset if you're entire family and all the spouses do fun things without you
nit3wr,We didn‚Äôt really think about how it would make Sarah feel.Why would you?Stop trying to fix it and focus on the daughters who aren't being daft. Leave the door open, but stop chasing her.
m1ak1z,You should say all of this to your mom and your mom should speak to her and make her accountable for actually doing her chores and keeping herself/her room clean.If your parent(s) will allow her to be disgusting that is not something you can fix.
m1ak1z,I‚Äôve tried talking to my mom about it but she either brushes it off or just recycled the same ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve told you to clean this up, so why haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù lecture with no consequences. I don‚Äôt want to let it be a ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just life‚Äù scenario, you know?
m1ak1z,also...poor dog? that little guy needs to be going outside. if he's not going outside for pee I doubt he's going for walks. maybe use the welfare of her dog as leverage
m1ak1z,It sounds like the mother isn't exactly "mom of the year" material.
m1ak1z,‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to college in a few months so I won‚Äôt be able to pick up after her and I don‚Äôt want this to keep going into her adult life.‚ÄùI think you have partially answered your own question here. Your parents don‚Äôt seem too concerned about holding her accountable and she doesn‚Äôt seem too concerned about getting better.I‚Äôm not one for giving absolute advice most of the time, but to me it seems like the only solution here is accepting that it‚Äôs not your job to parent or fix her, nor are you able to. Let it go and go to college. She will grow up, or not, on her own time. But sheltering her and trying to fix her problems for her isn‚Äôt going to do anything but shield her from the consequences of her lack of hygiene.You‚Äôre going to meet plenty of people in your life who you will feel the need to fix, and often they will be people you deeply care for and don‚Äôt want anything bad to happen to. But this is a dangerous path to follow for yourself. Learning when to let others help themselves is a vital skill to learn in order to not end up in codependent or abusive relationships.So the takeaway here is you can only help your sister and yourself by not helping. Easier said than done, but it‚Äôs possible.
m1ak1z,This is also some really good advice. I didn‚Äôt realize that I was also enabling it by cleaning up after her. I‚Äôll try talking to her seriously like another comment suggested and then stop trying to clean up after her like you have.
m1ak1z,This might be an obvious question, but have you brought it up with your parents?
m1ak1z,I did try talking to my mom but she hasn‚Äôt done much. I would‚Äôve tried to talk to my stepdad about it if my mom didn‚Äôt tell me not to. I don‚Äôt think he would‚Äôve done much either though.
m1ak1z,Honestly thank you for the advice. I‚Äôm really non-confrontational sometimes and I think I‚Äôve been that way too long with this. Thank you!!
m1ak1z,I'm not so sure.When I was a young teen I had friends tell me I stank, but I thought they were teasing me because in my mind I was doing everything that I thought I should do. It was only when I stayed over with another friend and their mum was like, "right mmlemony you have to shower everyday you are here and put a clean shirt and underwear on everyday as well" that I realised. My own parents never told me that or did that themselves so I didn't know.Sometimes you need to be parented rather than just told.
m1ak1z,Its not normal for people to not care if they smell or if their room is covered in feces. Has she been to the doctor to check for any mental disorders or severe depression? Her natural instincts should be going OFF about literal feces in her room, and the fact that they're not is a huge warning sign that she's going through something that is bigger than "she smells".If it's this bad and your parents aren't checking and making sure that she is washing, brushing, and cleaning her room EVERY DAY, despite knowing the situation, they are criminally negligent. She's clearly either not being raised, or has mental health concerns they're not addressing, and either way they're allowing their child to live in a room full of feces and pee so they're not meeting the basic requirement of a safe environment... A call to CPS or a conversation with a school counselor may not be out of order.
m1ak1z,She‚Äôs been evaluated for depression in an issue unrelated to this, but it was said that she didn‚Äôt have it. Also I should probably add that it‚Äôs not like covered in dog poop or anything since the dog is a small chihuahua, but there will be drops here and there that she just leaves while she‚Äôs out in the living room.
m1ak1z,Yeah there's a lot to unpack here. I know OP says that the doctor said she doesn't have depression, but I've been told that, too. I've also had chronic depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder since I was a kid. The doctor told me "I was a nice girl" and "I'll grow out of being emotional, that's just being a teenager."But, the lack grooming and her dirty mattress concerns me, because those are sometimes signs of sexual abuse or having been raped. I don't know OP's life from a hole in the ground, but those aren't normal 15 year old behaviors in the least.
m1ak1z,Talk to your parents. This is not your job as her sister.Also, take with you or put into secure storage anything you particularly value of your possessions, because your sister is going to spend the next few years letting the dog shit on everything you leave at home.
m1ak1z,Your parents are neglecting her (and you, and your dogs) terribly. Like ‚Äúget CPS and/or Health & Human Services‚Äù level neglect. I don‚Äôt care how busy they are, their primary responsibility, legally, ethically morally, etc. is to ensure the welfare of their children, and they are failing her spectacularly, setting her up for a lifetime of poor health. And you, feeling the need to take over the most basic task of providing clean, healthy housing for your little sister, is a tragedy. It probably feels normal to you but it is not.I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. PLEASE talk to a trusted counselor or teacher at school. I know it‚Äôs terrifying and probably feels risky and sort of like you‚Äôre betraying your parents, but your family needs outside help.
m1ak1z,OP, this is the real answer right here. I'm so happy that you'll be leaving home for college soon, and I hope your experience at school opens your eyes to the disfunctional environment you're being raised in. I also know how hard it is to ask for help. You should be proud of yourself for having the courage to make this post.
m1ak1z,Yep.  I had to scroll too darned far to find this comment. OP needs to go talk to a trusted teacher who knows the siblings.  I‚Äôve had siblings come and voice hygiene concerns to me, and I‚Äôve got the resources to be supportive and helpful.Sometimes parents lack the tools or turn a blind eye and having a conversation with someone they respect can help.Frankly, some years I‚Äôve had multiple stinky kids (sometimes in the same class), and it‚Äôs incumbent upon me as a fellow human to gently but frankly sort them out.
m1ak1z,She‚Äôs 15, which is a teenager, not a baby. She doesn‚Äôt need constant attention to be taken care of. She‚Äôs old enough to be able to take care of herself without her parents. I think the issue here is either depression or the less likely cause, laziness, but not neglect. Why do people think of teenagers as babies when they‚Äôre young adults. She‚Äôll be considered an adult in 3 years. If she doesn‚Äôt get her shit together to be able to take care of herself how the hell is she going to suddenly be independent at 18? Whatever is the cause, it needs to be resolved.
m1ak1z,Is the dog old or mobility-impaired or incontinent? Or is it using pee pads because it's stuck in a closed room with your sister and nobody lets it outside regularly?It seems like your family has a case of pet neglect or even abuse going on.If your parents aren't being responsible animal owners, maybe you can start taking the dog outside regularly. Get it into the habit so it will go to the door instead of shitting inside. I know it's another chore you didn't ask for, but instead of picking up old nasty pads you're spending some quality time with a dog who needs some actual love.
jk7rde,Thanks for the update. So glad you have recognized that you deserve to be treated with respect even though being single is scary. Take time to be proud of yourself for making the hard choice.
jk7rde,thank you so much, I needed the reassurance.
jk7rde,Emotional/verbal abuse typically escalates at some point. I recently left my abuser and your story reminds me of our early years. In the coming weeks and months, there may be moments you miss him. Stay strong and remember you deserve better! So proud of you!
jk7rde,I can second this comment, because it also happened to me. I‚Äôm happy for both of you for getting out <3
jk7rde,Be prepared for the extinction burst. usually in these scenarios they beg and apologize, and beg some more to give them another chance.. Then they are on their best behavior until they realize they arent getting what they want, then shit hits the fan.. I would block him on everything.
jk7rde,Second this. Please block him OP!
jk7rde,YUP. Love bombing, apologizing, promising to be better. He may be able to keep it up for a month or two but not forever. He‚Äôs already shown you who he is.
jk7rde,Just read your whole story... you are so strong for deciding to leave. I wish I had done it when I was your age back when I was with my emotionally/financially abusive bf. It just took me so long to realize that he wasn‚Äôt going to change no matter how many times I tried to explain to him my feelings and what he says/does sometimes hurts me. The part where you had poured your heart out and then he ended up making you cry which he then called you ‚Äúchildish‚Äù just brought me back to so many times of my bf doing that exact same thing.I was so numb the first few months after the breakup but then I realized things hurt because I was numb for so long and now my heart had room/time to defrost. Now I am with the sweetest guy who not only is patient when I am emotional/insecure but constantly gives the reassurance I needed. Not saying that having a person makes your life complete, but I am saying that the person you think doesn‚Äôt exist is definitely out there ready to treat you the way you deserve. They won‚Äôt care about what you wear and will encourage you to be who you want to be. Just gotta figure out who you are and what kind of person you want to be with. Don‚Äôt settle for anything less
jk7rde,This comment made me cry. I‚Äôm so sorry you went through that. Thank you for sharing that with me, it makes me feel more sure of my decision. After reading all these comments i think I‚Äôm going to take a break before trying to date again bc my heart is still broken and I don‚Äôt think it would be fair to put that on someone else. I‚Äôm going to spend time trying to figure out who I am when he isn‚Äôt in the picture so I can be a whole person next time. Re-assurance from someone who is older really helped me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
jk7rde,I am SO PROUD of you for getting out of that situation.
jk7rde,All this support is so overwhelming, that means so much to me. Thank you so much <3
jk7rde,Just read your original post, yeah you 100% did the right thing. Go enjoy (in safe way) exploring your sexuality. Dress how you wish and do what you wish (consenually) with whom you wish. As you grow you will hopefully learn that what you had wasn't love.My SO never tells me how to dress, never calls me names, never goes through my phone even though they know all my passwords.Enjoy college life.
jk7rde,What did he do when you broke up with him?
jk7rde,Oh, I called one of my cousins and asked him if he‚Äôd come with me to collect my stuff at out apartment and he took off time, we went yesterday. I don‚Äôt have a license bc my bf had one and I didn‚Äôt travel long distances without him so it seemed like a hassle to get one. It was the first time I saw my bf since our fight. He asked if we could work it out, said he didn‚Äôt realise that his temper was hurting me to this degree, I‚Äôm the only person he‚Äôs ever loved.When I told him that that wasn‚Äôt enough bc we‚Äôve talked about this before but whenever i brought up how he hurts me he made it my fault. I didn‚Äôt have much to pack, the apartment is mostly his and I only had two selves of clothes and textbooks. My cousin was in the car, I asked him to come check on me if I wasn‚Äôt back in half an hour.When I was done packing and I was leaving he said he‚Äôs the only person who will ever love me, that he‚Äôs the only person that can deal with my ‚Äúneediness‚Äù and my ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù (I have GAD and panic attacks) and a more hurtful things. I just told him that i gave him my world and all my time and attention and tried to make him happy but that I obviously couldn‚Äôt succeed bc obviously I‚Äôm not enough to make him happy. He roled his eyes and said I was melodramatic but I was emotional and I didn‚Äôt have anything left to say so he asked for the key to his apartment back so I gave it to him and left.
jk7rde,Thank you. I realise i need to do this bc i‚Äôve shaped all my life and career plans around him including my degree. i wanted to do law, he vetoed it bc his parents were both lawyers and weren‚Äôt around so he didn‚Äôt want that in a gf so I‚Äôm doing a finance degree i don‚Äôt really like instead. I‚Äôm only one year in though so i don‚Äôt think it would be too late if i changed, i think i need to consider if i want to switch degrees or not. Thank you for this advice !
jk7rde,You‚Äôre right, they do! I never really considered therapy before though, but maybe a few sessions will be helpful, especially bc i didn‚Äôt make any friends during high school unfortunately and I don‚Äôt want to dump all my issues on my best friend. Thank you for this suggestion :)
jk7rde,Oh thank god. I was worried about you. Halfway through that original post I was yelling at my phone. Under no circumstances should anyone be yelling at you, calling you names, and intentionally triggering your anxiety. Behavior like his only escalates as you try to do more and more to balance their fragile emotions and get things back to the way they used to be. Good riddance to him.
jk7rde,Thank you for thinking of me! One of the things that I haven‚Äôt accepted is the possibility that he did it on purpose, although the more I think back the harder it is to accept. Sometimes it would genuinely be him losing his temper, but other times he‚Äôd just pick on me out of nowhere and mock my attempts at de-escalating the situation, even apologies weren‚Äôt enough bc ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù would be met by ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm sure you are‚Äù and then back to being cross with me so it felt like a no-win situation. It‚Äôs just so heartbreaking that someone I trusted that much would sometimes intentionally use my triggers against me...
jk7rde,Thank you for the update, please know this was 100% the right decision, he was a horrible boyfriend, please know there are so many good people out there in your future!
jv9s89,It seems to me that even if your uncle is gay, which IMO is pretty likely but far from certain, that would only be only one aspect of the true answer to the question of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the deal with your uncle and John?‚Äù Don‚Äôt take this the wrong way, but my gut feeling is that if he hasn‚Äôt explained whatever is going on with the two of them yet, there‚Äôs probably some aspect to it that would be hard to understand for someone who hasn‚Äôt experienced adult life, and I would urge you not to push him on it.Having said that, it would probably be a good idea to make a point of being supportive of the LBGTQ community to show that you wouldn‚Äôt react negatively if someone in your life came out to you.
jv9s89,This is a really good point. OP should let the uncle passively know they support the LGBTQ community by maybe talking about a friend who identifies with the community, or watch some LGBTQ friendly movie with him, show support and empathy for the characters. They should be subtle enough that if he isn't gay, it shouldn't be out of the norm, and if he is, he should know he's got your support.
jv9s89,I don't call him Uncle John, is that weird? Now that I think about it I feel like that's weird, he's the only adult that I don't use a family word for or call Mrs/Mr. Name
jv9s89,I like this advice.  No one should pressure someone to reveal their sexuality, so this advice of making sure your uncle knows you're in support of LGBTQ rights will make it comfortable for him and his partner to come out to you, if they choose.
jv9s89,I second this comment, it's something personal between your Uncle and his friend, show that you would be supportive and it may help them be comfortable enough to tell you what their relationship is, but don't force the conversation to happen, if that is indeed the nature of their relationship
jv9s89,Having said that, it would probably be a good idea to make a point of being supportive of the LBGTQ community to show that you wouldn‚Äôt react negatively if someone in your life came out to youWas totes coming here to write something like this. I think, if he is gay and he is experiencing some anxiety or trepidation about what you would think of him, then to hear you or see you being supportive to gay people would probably take a lot of weight off of his shoulders.You sound like a lovely young person and you must care about him a lot to be thinking of how you can show him you love him. That is wholesome and heartwarming, OP. üíØüíï
jv9s89,I think part of it may also be that John may or may not be married (OP mentioned that John might have a daughter). I think that opens up a big can of worms aside from the gay aspect.
jv9s89,And I know it‚Äôs his choice but it also kind of bugs me that he doesn‚Äôt feel like he can share his own life with me, I‚Äôm 17 not 7So if he has been raised by religious family, and people can be homophobic without being religious - it's probable that if he is gay he doesn't want to lose his family over it. Also, if he's been raising you alone, he's worried that someone might accuse him of touching you. People love to accuse gay people of being paedophiles.So please understand that if he is gay, and that's if, he might feel too much pressure from his whole environment to admit it to anyone, and it's nothing to do with you personally.
jv9s89,This! Drop pro LGBTQ when you can, and if you are right, hopefully he'll come out to you. Make sure he knows you love him, especially for stepping in.
jv9s89,Thanks for this
jv9s89,My dad was your first paragraph. He and mom were completely platonic after I was born. My mom caught him through letters he was writing to prisoners fantasizing about them, and because he watched gay porn. I distinctly remember them getting in a fight about it because "Oh no! The evils of porn!" And he finally broke down and told her. We could hear the whole thing. They were very religious and although he fought his porn "demons" he was still a "sinner" for thinking about men that way. Luckily my mom came to terms with it (I suspect my mom is asexual. She basically came out to me as such without using the word), and I'm fine with it. But he was sitting on that secret for a good 50 years. Breaks my heart. I once overheard him say something along the lines of "I wish I could just be castrated since I have no use for it anyway." And although I don't know the context, I have a pretty good guess.
jv9s89,There can be a lot of internal homophobia as well. The uncle may not be comfortable completely admitting it to himself. OP‚Äôs feelings on homosexuality may have very little to do with why the uncle is so secretive.
jv9s89,This is a really good point that didn‚Äôt even cross my mind... you are absolutely right, there are people in this world that would accuse Uncle of that for the sole reason that he is gay (assuming of course that he IS gay). Which obviously sucks, but you might be spot on about why he chooses to keep it on the DL for now, especially with OP being a minor.
jv9s89,I‚Äôve read through your replies here, I think you‚Äôre a very kind person who cares about your uncle and wants to share life with your uncle and make sure he feels supported. I would drop little LGBTQ positivity around. Maybe watch that show queer eye in the living room, mention a friend of yours coming out as bi and how it makes you so happy he is living his truth, etc.Also, if you‚Äôre like me, my family had a hard time sharing anything about dating and relationships. I had a really hard time talking to my parents about my own love life. I‚Äôd try to approach your uncle about this and just talk about your own love life. ‚ÄúHey uncle I was thinking about asking this girl to the dance. I think she would like a big gesture, I‚Äôm thinking of asking her friends to help me surprise her‚Äù or like whatever it is. Involve your uncle as a person you go to for advice or even just as a sounding board for your own problems. This might help break the tension around love and relationships and what you two are comfortable talking about, one day that level of conversation might let him feel comfortable talking to you about that.
jv9s89,As a queer person in a very conservative environment:Do not bring it up. Do not talk to your uncle or John or anyone else about whether or not they are together. If he wants to tell you, he'll tell you. If you want him to know that you won't be weird about them being together-- which they might or might not be, who knows-- then just drop some pro-LGBT stuff here and there. Talk about supporting an LGBT friend, or liking a queer couple on TV, or whatever. But don't be on the nose about any of it, just keep it on the dl.Good luck my dude!
jv9s89,Good ideas thanks man!
jv9s89,This is great advice. If they are hiding the relationship there is probably a very good reason why and even if OP is supportive it still might jeopardize their secret getting out to those they are really keeping it from.
i4nbdc,This isn't a white lie, this is a huge web of lies on which he's built the foundations of your relationship. I would forever be wondering what else he's lied about. Get out.
i4nbdc,This is the issue for me. It honestly wouldn‚Äôt be as big of a deal if this wasn‚Äôt like a huge part of our relationship (the bonding and confiding in one another, I mean). I come from a harsh background and I had a difficult life growing up and it was very special to me to have someone who I thought could at least mildly understand. I‚Äôve also told him so many painful and personal things while he was lying to me non stop apparently
i4nbdc,Exactly. These aren‚Äôt white lies at all, this is like [Fry squint] trying to figure out if literally anything he ever said was the truth.
i4nbdc,My hard won advice would be to walk away because I predict/fear there are more lies. I got married to a woman who for the first 6 months of our rs made me believe that her best friend sometimes lived at her house when she was in between places. Her best friend turned out to be her ex who still lived in that house but would leave every weekend when I came over. Her reasoning for lying; she was scared I wouldn‚Äôt date her if I knew she was living with her ex. Back then (I was 25/26), I truly wanted to believe in second chances and also tried to understand the lie, and I ended up marrying someone who lied about so many things, all the time, big and small, and justified cheating on me and treating me like crap all the time. It took me years to build trust with a partner after the divorce and I still don‚Äôt really, am in therapy for it. The thing about your partner lying; what he basically did was forge a connection out of something he knew would touch you in some way; my ex wife did the same thing. I was vegan, of course she was vegan. I was straight edge, of course she never drank either. I loved reading and poetry etc, of course she was into the exact same things. It seems like small things to lie about, but what happens is that you fall in love with someone that doesn‚Äôt even exist. Who is your boyfriend when not the person he made you believe he was? Someone financially not very responsible? Someone who you may not be attracted to in the long run because he determined what your core values are, realized he does not match up, thus created a persona you would like? What‚Äôs more concerning, he lies, keeps lying and seems to show no remorse or deeper reflection on what prompted his behavior in the first place. I don‚Äôt see him do much to earn your trust back at this point. I would put pause on this relationship, call it a break or whatever if you are not ready for a full on end just yet, and think about how this all effects you and how things could go forward from here. What would he need to do to prove he can be a trustworthy partner? I think he probably won‚Äôt do much, and a pause or break will bring up more things that were not true, but I‚Äôd also like to be wrong about this for your sake. For now, I would seriously reconsider building anything serious with this man, and building your future around him. He is 32, not a teenager. If a grown man does not know at this age that lying like this is the worst base for a relationship,  it may be better to let him go. It might save you a world of (financial and emotional) trouble.
i4nbdc,The financial aspect is also troubling. I was pretty focused on just the principle of him making shit up (also probably worth mentioning he has told me funny stories about his past where he is the main character, but then will later tell the same exact story but from the viewpoint of it happening to someone else? When I bring this up he denies ever doing that). But it‚Äôs also deeply troubling to think that he has told me he owned a house, paid off debts, and has enough leftover to send to his parents. None of this is true. Also worth mentioning he gets commission from his job on top of the same salary I make. I save $1,500 a month (with having all my bills paid and sending money to my mom). I don‚Äôt make a ton and live in an expensive city but my point is I‚Äôm frugal and serious about money and saving for my future. I guarantee he doesn‚Äôt save that much because he only has $15k in savings. So once again the numbers don‚Äôt add up and here I am wondering where this money goes. I‚Äôm rambling but I‚Äôm at a loss here so I‚Äôm just trying to get all my thoughts out. Thank you for taking the time to respond. I have this vision of myself at like 35 with a couple of kids and finding out about some other really serious lie and it terrifies me. I‚Äôm also really scared because to be honest, I find it hard to open up to new people over fear of them judging me for my past. It‚Äôs a clusterfuck lol
i4nbdc,None of these are 'white lies'. White lies are harmless lies that make social interactions go smoother. This is a man who's had no problems lying to you for three years about his financial situation, and who only came clean because you're not an idiot and realised the numbers didn't add up. If you hadn't questioned it, how long would he have kept lying to you? And you already know this isn't just a 'white lie that got out of control', you say in your post that he lies to your face about other things! So no, this isn't a small issue. You're dating a guy who literally lies to you all the time about everything, including things that really affect you and your future. So yes, I think it is insane that you're still considering life with this man.
i4nbdc,I‚Äôm not bothered by the fact that his parents help him out either, I guess. But if I‚Äôm being honest it does make me think differently of him because he has complete financial ability to take care of himself and just let‚Äôs them pay his way. And then lies and says it‚Äôs the other way around. And then cries to me about how his life was so hard growing up and how poor he was to try and relate to me, when that‚Äôs obviously not the case. I find it offensive I guess because as someone who actually grew up severely underprivileged and worked my ass off to get where I am, I feel like it‚Äôs a weird form of like stolen valor? Completely wrong terminology I know but I‚Äôm just saying he plays this part of a dude who had nothing and made something out of it and it‚Äôs just not true. I wouldn‚Äôt think he was a bad person if he had a good life, hell I would have killed to grow up the way he did. It‚Äôs gross to me that he lies to either make himself seem more interesting or hard working or manly or whatever I don‚Äôt even know
i4nbdc,This ain‚Äôt no white lies. They‚Äôre just lies. And yes those are huge red flags flying in the wind. Leave now, it‚Äôs good y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt married yet. All the best.
i4nbdc,WHAT ABOUT THESE LIES ARE "WHITE"?!  A white lie is "Yes, of course I lie your haircut."  This is a years-long running web of deceit and you still don't know the truth.
i4nbdc,If he‚Äôs still lying there‚Äôs no recovery from this.If he‚Äôs owning his faults, being sincerely apologetic and willing to go to therapy, I think it‚Äôs possible to continue this relationship. Living together you‚Äôll need total transparency in your finances.I can somehow understand why he lied in the start but I can not understand why he would continue to lie when the cat‚Äôs out of the box.
i4nbdc,This is what really messed with me. Apparently as it stands he has told me everything (obviously not sure if I can believe that but whatever). But what really bothered me is that he went from saying ‚Äúthe debt I had was paid by my parents‚Äù and then he walked out of the room and came back quite literally 30 seconds later and said ‚Äúthat was a lie, my business partner actually took responsibility and paid it‚Äù. As this was unfolding he lied to my face several more times, I just pressed and told him I could tell he was still lying and he would go ‚Äúyeah you‚Äôre right, I am, I don‚Äôt know why‚Äù with a pouty face as if I was supposed to console him. I was baffled
i4nbdc,To me these are not ‚Äòwhite lies‚Äô. A white lie is if he said he didn‚Äôt eat the last cookie but he did really. It‚Äôs a trivial unimportant lie. These lies he has told you are not trivial. They are huge and have led you to question his integrity and personality.I think you are right to reconsider whether he is the right partner for you, maybe some therapy would help unpick some of this.
i4nbdc,White lies aren't just trivial. They are for the benefit of the person being lied to. Eating the last cookie and lying about it is for the benefit of the liar.
i4nbdc,That's just lying...a white lie gives no benefit to the liar and usually in some way benefits the person being lied to.
i4nbdc,Eating the last cookie and lying about it is not a white lie, it's a pathetic lie and suggests the person is dishonest by nature or is 5 years old.
i4nbdc,These are major lies. And if mommy and daddy are bank rolling him what will happen if they stop or die? You are going to have to financially support this lying man baby possibly for life. You should nope right out of this relationship asap. He isn't a partner, he is a burden. Right now he is a burden on his parents and he is looking to be your burden next when the parents are no longer a viable option.
i4nbdc,Forget about the whole past thing and getting to know you and focus on the lie itself. He lied about serious financials. Its not a little thing like missing a payment once in a while. When you're in a serious relationship eventually your finances come together and do you really want to bear his burdens as well as any other things he'll lie about. For your mental and financial health I'd advise you to find some who doesn't lie about their financials to that extent. Just know that people out there exist as this is a reasonable expectation and you don't have to settle for this.
i7wkqu,Lawyer first. Get the divorce filed, and get their advice on if it's ok for you to leave the house while things are processing.As for the other, you need to fill your time. Devote yourself to hobbies, including picking up new ones. Rely on friends - long video calls, watching movies together, etc. Fill as much of your time as you can until things start to process.I'm so sorry he gave up on you without even trying, hon. You deserve far better than that. It's a shame some people are so good at hiding how little respect they have for other folk, but please hold onto the fact that none of this was your fault. There is absolutely zero reason for a partner to cheat, ever, and there is absolutely no justification that can put even a shred of the blame on you.
i7wkqu,Thank you. The worst thing is that he tried to turn it on me this morning, that things had been off. But it only started being off when he started this affair and he began gaslighting me.
i7wkqu,And don't use the same lawyer just to save money. That never works out in the end.
i7wkqu,No property, no kids, no lawyer necessary. Not sure of OP's situation but no mention of those things.
i7wkqu,You can't go to therapy and work this out. It only gets worked out if both people want to put the effort in, and your husband has made it very clear he's not interested in trying to make the relationship work. He directly told you that. You need to find a lawyer and file for divorce.
i7wkqu,Thank you. I guess it‚Äôs just hard to watch him blow up his own life so spectacularly. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm watching a cruel puppet of my husband.
i7wkqu,She can still go to therapy (and should) to work it out with herself. Dealing with that shit is horrific and she will benefit greatly with help while working through this.
i7wkqu,This. Straight to the point, but also, don‚Äôt blame yourself. When people cheat they always try to blame the innocent party. He‚Äôs a dog. He lead you on but only cared about himself and his wants/needs. You don‚Äôt cheat on someone you‚Äôre in love with. Find someone who looks at you like you looked at him. Someone who sees you as their forever. Don‚Äôt settle for anything less. Oh and quit brushing off those little signs that are in your face!!!!
i7wkqu,Call a lawyer. Relationships take two and he's clearly done.
i7wkqu,Have a mantra to help you when things get overwhelming."I'm going to be okay. This sucks but I'm going to be okay." "I am a loyal, trustworthy, hardworking woman, I deserve the same in return." "I am beautiful, I am confident, I am worthy." Even if you don't feel they are true in this moment, it will help to say them out loud until they hold truth to you.I'm sorry you are going through this. You can't trust this man anymore and he is not willing to compromise with you. You deserve better.
i7wkqu,I absolutely have to agree with how helpful a mantra can be. My ex-husband was abusive, cheating, lying, stealing, just the worst possible and we had been together since we were young teens. It was a HARD break up. He kicked out me and our two kids (1 and 2 years old at the time), right after maxing out my credit cards and spending all of our savings. I hadn't been allowed to work since the kids were born because he would threaten me every time. He didn't pay child support or see the kids. He was stalking me and I was scared to file for divorce because he didn't want me to and was legitimately dangerous.I got through the first year just repeating "I can, I am, I will" which was short for "I can get through this/do these things/make something positive out of this because I am doing it, and I will continue to until I come out on the other side." Finished a degree, got a good full time job with benefits, am raising these beautiful children to be better than he was, and it keeps getting better. That mantra pulled me out of some dark thoughts. It wasn't over the top, and was just enough that I could actually believe it.
i7wkqu,This is good advice. If you say something enough you eventually start to feel that it is true. And it is true. He made his choices but you are worth so much more OP.
i7wkqu,I also like ‚ÄúI can do hard things.‚Äù
i7wkqu,I was where you are 5 years ago. My husband leaving me and subsequent divorce was very sudden and traumatic. It took time but eventually I got my emotional shit together and life went on. You'll be thrown for a loop for a while but what absolutely will help is cutting both people out completely. No "gaining closure talks", no coffee dates to catch up, no late night texts etc. Block them on all social media and step back from mutual friends.Make sure you are serious in your conviction that your husband is a stranger who doesn't deserve your time. Same goes for your "friend". That means they aren't allowed to weasel their way back into your life.You loving either one of them is not an excuse to let them back in your life. You have to accept and understand that fact. One or the other will want some form of contact at some point, they don't deserve that from you.Throw yourself into hobbies, friends, getting a new job, exercising whatever.
i7wkqu,The first thing you need to do is work on what your first step in the divorce will be.  Go talk to a lawyer.  Many offer free initial consultations. You are posting here asking for emotional support - and you do clearly need it - but the main thing you to need to do is get yourself out of this terrible situation where you are married to someone who doesn't give two shits about you.  You will feel better if you start taking definite steps in that direction.People post here all the time about finding out their partner cheated or had an affair but they want to work things out and the poster doesn't know how to trust them.  Your husband is making this easy for you - he doesn't even pretend to want to work on things.Don't forget that decision of his even if he later changes his mind and wants to work things out.  He has chosen the other woman in a clear an unambiguous way.  Even if he chooses you later, you already know that doesn't stop him from looking for a better option.  Even if your "friend" decides to end the affair for good, you should assume your husband will look for yet another alternative option to you.Therapy is also a good idea, when you can get around to it.  You might also look around for support groups - maybe r/surviving_infidelity, or maybe a local group of some kind.  Or maybe just a friend or family member or two who you can turn to right now.  (NOT your husband, obviously).
i7wkqu,Thank you. I will absolutely be heading over to that subreddit.
kz6fpy,Honestly? Sounds like you were doing fine.Be polite. Be pleasant. Maybe periodically try to engage with her.It‚Äôs not on you, the kid, to develop a relationship with this older adult. And if you aren‚Äôt there yet, that‚Äôs fine.Maybe ask your dad why this is such an issue for them. What do they want to happen? What do they view as wrong here?
kz6fpy,I second that the onus is on the adults/parents in this situation. I specify parents because something similar happened to me when I was technically an adult, but it was still a parent/child dynamic. It really sucks that not only do you (OP) have this burden, but that your younger siblings are in the same boat and looking to you for guidance. I don‚Äôt really know what advice to give you... hang in there OP and feel free to DM if you need a listening ear.
kz6fpy,THIS.üíØ it‚Äôs not on you- as his child- to start developing a relationship with HIS girlfriend who is in fact an adult.i can‚Äôt tell you how many times my dad has expected- and even thinks- we have golden relationship when he only started to be apart of my life at the age of 18, when i found out i was going to be a mom. he still expects me to give him the relationship i have with my mom, talk to him everyday, and expects me to be able to go to him about things but i literally have no relationship with him at all.either way, it‚Äôs not the child‚Äôs job to develop any form of relationship. if she wants to feel ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù and ‚Äúwelcomed‚Äù then she should be doing more to get to know you and your siblings.
kz6fpy,Her dad needs to be far more proactive and be the leader in this situation. It almost sounds like he expects his 16 year old daughter to take the lead, which is wrong.
kz6fpy,Maybe periodically try to engage with her.My advice for this aspect is to ask her questions that make her do the talking. Most people like talking about themselves, and it takes the pressure off of you.Questions about: her job, her hobbies, what family does she have, where she grew up, pets, etcOf course, this is if you feel like it. I agree, you were doing fine. It's a tough situation. Best of luck.
kz6fpy,^Sounds like u hav to be the adult here (as opposed to your dad) - try and talk to her a bit. Support your siblings.
kz6fpy,Did any of you meet her before he moved her in? It is so bizarre to me that some parents pull stunts like this.
kz6fpy,My mom followed the parenting advice of "don't introduce the boyfriend to your kids until it's serious"... Except serious to her meant that he was moving in I guess, and we didn't even know she was dating anyone until we had a new roommate lol it was awkward for everyone.
kz6fpy,Right? I didn't meet my SO's kid for six months. Then gradual introduction for another six or so, then more regular for the next year. Then a little after two years, we moved in together. And everything was discussed with his son and he was given some sense of choice in the matter (though his answer was predictable). I don't get how people rush into that level of commitment, especially when kids are involved and more care should be taken with them.
kz6fpy,My ex-wife moved her girlfriend in with our kids, after dating for just a month, having met the kids only one time before that. It‚Äôs incredibly irresponsible.We weren‚Äôt even separated yet. She met the girl last April, moved out and in with her girlfriend by May. Divorce was final in November, apparently they got engaged on New Year‚Äôs Eve. What a total shit show.
kz6fpy,My ex best-friend moved in approximately three boyfriends (and let at least four others stay the night from day one and play house) with her son between ages 2-4 within days of beginning to date them, after leaving her husband. She most recently moved in her boyfriend of under a week when we were living together, and slightly under two months later asked me to move out of our home so his cousin/cousin‚Äôs GF could have my room because they all lived together but her BF paid the bills and it was silly for him to ‚Äúhave two places.‚Äù This was after I‚Äôd expressed, again, that I wasn‚Äôt happy about a new dude moving in with us immediately after they‚Äôd met. So, I left. Now they‚Äôre moved out of state and pregnant.
kz6fpy,My parents got divorced when I was 12 and a month later my mom introduced us to a man and said he was her bf and he was gonna be living with us starting that day. I had a terrible relationship with the both of them
kz6fpy,This, I mean it's his house so if he wants to have someone in then he can but, judging by the post, not introducing a woman you are seriously dating to your children is just wrong.
kz6fpy,They had already met her, because she was a family friend, but my ex moved his AP in the day I moved out and never told our young children it was coming. People in the haze of new relationship energy and a mid life thing are selfish to a degree it is hard to fathom.
kz6fpy,Bizarre? More like cruel and selfish.
kz6fpy,It's terribly selfish. The children's feelings should come before the parents in this situation. If my hypothetical kids said they didn't want my partner moving in, I wouldn't do it. Improve the relationship first, then take that step.
kz6fpy,This is not on you - it's 100% on your dad. If he is someone you can talk to, sit him down and tell him how it made you feel that he didn't give you any input into moving someone into your home. Tell him you don't feel like you know his GF at all, and that you feel uncomfortable with the situation. If he can listen and own up to his messup, then you can go from there in figuring out ways to get along with GF.Coexisting with a roommate (essentially what she is now) is perfectly fine - be polite, don't leave a big mess, etc. Kind of prepares you for college life, in a way. But if you can, it might make things easier to be open to getting to know her, once the shock wears off. Your dad should be putting forth a majority of the effort in making that happen, since this was his decision.
kz6fpy,Your dad is expecting you to do the emotional labour of building a relationship with his girlfriend, which is a really shitty thing to do. It is his girlfriend and his children so he needs to act as the bridge not you. Tell him this.
kz6fpy,I agree ! It is their job to cultivate a relationship with you! Not the other way around.
i1chj5,Thanks for posting this.  Although I was not around here back then, it was cool of you to update and recognize those who were trying to help.  I'm glad to hear things have gotten better for you with that creep out of your life..
i1chj5,Sometimes it‚Äôs really hard to leave an abusive/bad relationship because your SO makes it feel like you are not worthy of someone better. Until you truly are able to love yourself and ok with being by yourself are you free from being codependent or settling in terrible relationships to not feel alone.
i1chj5,I'm sorry you had to go through this. Reading the original outloud to my Husband he immediately said he's jealous. Glad to hear the jerk admitted it
i1chj5,Hope your ex didn‚Äôt do anything to damage your relationship with your brother! It sounds like you are both people who care immensely about each other and I hope you‚Äôre still close :)
i1chj5,Nope, but probably because my brother was understanding and realized how manipulative he was. At one point, my ex forced me to ask him to move out in an "it's either him or me"type of move, and I did :(but my brother didn't exactly have anywhere to go mid-semester. I apologized to my brother about that later and explained to him, and he said it was all good - what bothered him the most was that we never hung out anymore.
i1chj5,Isn‚Äôt it amazing how much you can grow in just 5 years? 23 year old you was still a kid.You‚Äôve grown and matured and thankfully outgrew a bad relationship. :)
i1chj5,Bloody hell.Maybe he secretly fancied your brother.
i1chj5,You may be joking, but that's not out of the realm of possibility.
i1chj5,People love throwing the "you're fucking your sibling" in your face if you get along with them don't they? There's been a few recent posts where the conflict has always been the SO being irrationally jealous of the OP's siblings. Over it's just gross people try and shame you for getting along...
i1chj5,I also noticed the comment /u/zizzymoo left in your last post. It was so kind, and I wondered how that checklist went for you at that time.I'm glad you saw him for what he was, and also for checking in with an update. Happy you've moved on to another guy who hopefully treats you - and your brother! - right.
i1chj5,Yeah, now /u/zizzymoo is a moderator for  r/niceadvice :)
i1chj5,So glad you're in a better place now. It's funny how you can view a situation differently after you are removed from it. How is your brother doing?
i1chj5,He's good as well! Was very forgiving of the situation, and pretty much saw through everything and always knew how shitty the guy was, so he was honeslty relieved when we broke up.
i1chj5,I read your first post and it‚Äôs SO much sounds like every abused girl. I‚Äôm so glad you got out and are spreading awareness. A really great example. Good luck
i1chj5,Honestly, same :(I mean, pretty much as soon as we broke up "for good" it was like the cloud was lifted. Going back and reading this was just crazy. I can't believe I stayed as long as I did.
i1chj5,My ex boyfriend once told me to kill myself because I performed at my high-school talent show without him. HE WAS ALREADY GRADUATED. And there was no prior plans to do it together either so it was obviously him being insecure as fuck for no apparent reason other than I did something without him.
i1chj5,Yikes :/That's similar to how my relationship ended. I was in a really bad place during a major argument we had after he told me he was good, started driving us home, and then started commenting about how drunk he actually was, but it's okay because he's "a better drunk driver than most" :-| So we got into a HUGE argument about that, because obviously that's BS, and I ended up spiraling and chatting with the suicide. I finally went into our apartment (I was sitting in the car), and he was asleep. When I woke him up, I told him, and he said "you're a grown adult - you can kill yourself if you want to.That was the point I said to him "Wow, how am I not supposed to break up with you after that comment?" and he just blew up at me and told me we were done.
i1chj5,Happy you are better now! Wow a lot of things you said make me realize how bad a relationship I was in really was... My ex would say the most random things about my parents like "look how your mom is looking with disapproval to me" and she wasn't even looking, and "I won't stop doing these things I know that hurt you because I don't want to chose"... I feel you. Amazing to see you moved on beautifully and thank you for the advices. üíñ
i1chj5,I was with someone who thought having male roommates and friends was weird. I moved in with him mainly because I didn't have the money to keep my apartment and didn't want to go to a homeless shelter. I got trapped there for years because he got me pregnant and I couldn't afford to leave. So if there are red flags, get out.
i1chj5,I‚Äôm not trying to be rude or anything but just genuinely making a remark, do you think in the past years you‚Äôve spent enough time single?Has it been easy to keep your identity strong and personality throughout?Sorry bout the experiences, it‚Äôs tough but we can‚Äôt be hard on ourselves for wanting to see the best in people
i1chj5,Well, coming out of that it was honestly like an instant fog had been lifted from me. I had so much anxiety and depression in that relationship that I thought was *me*, and it turned out to be directly caused by him (he even *told* me he knew what he was doing to me), that has all vanished. So I've been able to be A) much more clear-minded and B) much more myself in this relationship.Yes, I met my current boyfriend about 1.5 months after my ex and I broke up, but that wasn't really the plan lol. I wanted to just experience being single for a while, but I just happened to meet my current boyfriend and had to be with him :)
ndbv44,My friend has 2 autistic siblings who require full-time care, and their parents are older. She got married a couple years ago. One thing she made clear to her husband from when they started dating was that she was going to take over caring for her siblings one day. He decided he was okay with that and married her knowing that was their plan. This really is something that needs to be worked out before marriage though, and it‚Äôs not really an area where you two can compromise. Taking care of a disabled person is hard work, and you‚Äôll resent her if you get forced into it, but she‚Äôll resent you if she has to put her brother in a care home. This might be a situation where your goals are just not compatible, and it is a deal breaker.
ndbv44,My SO has a severely disabled brother and he needs to care for him regularly because his father isn't in the picture and his mother realistically can't do it on her own. He doesn't have a choice in this and while he loves his brother dearly, I sometimes notice he resents the situation he is out in by the father and his mother. He lost a huge chunk of his childhood because he has to care for him. He had to quit jobs, take breaks from UNI, etc. He loves his brother. But he regularly has fights with mom, he doesn't want kids for another 10 years at least, since he's basically taken care of one for as long as he lives... And what's even worse is he feels so guilty and becomes incredibly defensive everytime he confides in me about it.OP, this is a conversation you should resolve immediately if you're planning on marrying this woman. It should have been resolved long ago. Disabled people are incredibly hard work and you two seem to be at an impass. You need to realize you will be giving up things you can't even think of right now if you agree to this.You're not wrong for not wanting to take care of him, but neither is she for wanting to. I know this sub loves to recommend breaking up, but this truly is a dealbreaker situation. You will both be unhappy without finding some middle ground to stand on.That being said, there are also resources you could look into if you're set on making your SO happy, you just have to look into it. Maybe not have him stay with you full time but only on weekends abd holidays, etc.
ndbv44,Right here exactly, OP.No one is wrong with the way they wanna live. Buuuut you two may either need to come up with a compromise or go your separate ways. I hope you guys are able to talk it out calmly and respectfully.
ndbv44,Prehaps if his parents begin to struggle caring for him full time as they age. Rather than him going to a care home /residential place. They could employ carers or a PA to go in a few hours a day at their home.If op isn't prepared to take on such a responsibility (understandably) they need to make a plan for the brother. But do bare in mind that residental placements can be awesome for the individual and give a new lease of life to them, while also improving family dynamics. It isn't necessarily a bad thing moving in to a placement. Some people even do a few days in the placement and a few at home with family (maybe with carers support) it is OK for her and her family to seek out professionals and take some of the weight off, which can improve and evolve relationships immenselyHe's not a child anymore, and change comes with that. Even in disabled people. We become adults and even if low functioning life will need to have stages, and allow them to grow up in to the adult they're able to be. But with suitable support, accommodations, activities, equipment, carers, general wellbeing. I don't know how funding works in your country but that's something to look at.I am severely physically disabled myself (and some struggles mentally and cognitively but not to a severe degree).and before covid I was stable, with my own care plan, PAs/carers, physio, hydro, heath supervision,  maintenance with my doctors. I am in a bungalow down the road from my mums flat. who still is doing half my care. I'd have 4 visits a day and about 7-10 hours of care.I have 4 brothers and no doubt if anything happened to mum they'd step in in a guardian type of role even though I'm an adult. But I wouldnt necessarily move in with them, they can advocate for me and support me in many ways whilst I keep my current independence, or go in to an assisted living placement if needed.When it comes to placements the best ones to seek out would be one that deals with mostly the same conditions and level of ability within the home. With more than just basic functions being covered. One that actually give a quality of life.So someone who is solely physically disabled and needs a lot of physical support but are totally capable mentally and cognitively then a home with mostly severely mentally/cognitively disabled people wouldn't be as ideal or equipped.Hope that makes sense. It's really hard. But she isn't responsible for him and she can be an amazing support and sister without him moving in with you. It isnt even necessarily in HIS best interest. Good luck
ndbv44,Well said, take my cheap silver!
ndbv44,This is a deal breaker.   The only way you can go forward with this relationship and your planned marriage is if you are 100% OK with you and your fianc√© being lifetime guardians and care givers for the brother.This isn‚Äôt something that you can change her mind on without a lifetime of resentment.Even if parents continue to care for the boy they will get too old to do so someday and this subject is certain to resurface in the future.I feel sorry for you as you have a very serious decision to make.  Think of the life you want and choose wisely.
ndbv44,Totally agree. In addition, I feel that the fianc√© doesn‚Äôt have a realistic vision of what it will be like to take in her brother. It doesn‚Äôt sound at all like ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt even notice he‚Äôs there‚Äù. If that was the case he could live independently. I also wonder if the fianc√© even discussed her plans with her parents as they seem unaware. It seems like she drew up a plan where she‚Äôs a kind of Florence Nightingale for her brother, but hasn‚Äôt actually thought it out very well.
ndbv44,This is the correct answer. OP needs to be completely OK, in his heart of hearts, with having her brother as part of his immediate family, and to care for him for as long as he himself, or the brother, dies.His fianc√©e has seemingly already committed herself to caring for her brother, and I doubt there is anything that can reduce or eliminate that commitment without causing deep resentment. So there are no compromises possible that won't trigger that resentment and ultimately destroy OP's relationship with her.Conversely, this does not seem like something that OP is capable of compromising or accepting 100% without generating a lot of resentment and regret. Even if it's possible to put off the main confrontation by having the parents continuing caring for him for as long as they are able to, I strongly suspect such a compromise will in itself cause a lot of resentment from the fianc√©e. Then, once this arrangement ceases to be tenable, it will come to a head and do so fueled by a ton of pent up frustration and resentment on her part.At that point, OP's marriage will already be skating on very thin ice, and even if he agreed to everything his wife suggests about the arrangements with her brother living with them, any sign, real or imagined, of OP not being happy and 100% onboard with this new situation will likely lead to a very heated argument/fight.OP will probably end up feeling like his now wife is going out of her way to find things to fight with him about, and he won't be entirely wrong, even if she won't be able to see that about herself or even hear OP out about it.So yeah, it really is about OP being 100% onboard, or bust. Frankly, just going by OP's post, it's pretty clear that he's not onboard and very unlikely to substantially change his mind about it.So unfortunately, I believe OP will have to bite the bullet and call off the wedding. No matter how advanced the plans for the wedding are, doing so will be cheaper and much less painful than allowing things to continue on the current trajectory to the wedding and beyond.OP says that "I‚Äôm not marrying her for her family", and this is no doubt true. It is, however, also true that no matter why he is marrying her, her family will be part of the deal and can't be negotiated away or ignored, and any attempt to do so will backfire in a big way on OP.I feel really bad for OP, he's in an impasse, and wherever he tries to go from here, there will be pain. To minimize that pain, OP needs to be completely honest with himself, and also his fianc√©e, and recognize that while just letting things go on without trying to address the issues may temporarily put off the conflict and the bulk of the pain that comes with it, but doing so will only make the eventual conflict, and pain, even greater once it inevitably catches up with them.If, at that point, OP and his now wife have had children together, things will not only be 10x more painful for OP and his wife, but it will now also affect their children and cause them pain as well as permanent mental "damage".So however attractive it may seem to just pretend all is fine and not deal with the conflict and pain right now, this is guaranteed to make the eventual conflict and pain so much worse.OP and his fianc√©e will both be better off if they're released from this relationship and free to find someone more compatible with their plans and commitments, even if in the moment of break-up, it may not seem like that to either of them.
ndbv44,I agree with you, but a compromise would be for OP and his fiance to wait until their children are older. Caring for young children and the brother simultaneously will divide their time and energy in too many directions. If they wait for their kids to grow up a bit, it'll be easier to give everyone the attention they need.
ndbv44,If your fianc√©e agrees with your proposal, what is the plan when her parents find that they can no longer care for him? Will you then take him in forever?
ndbv44,What generally happens is they will move into a group home or live with a provider who will be paid by the state to take care of them.They can still maintain a relationship with him and have him over for visits.Edit: Having worked in this field‚Äîit is a full time job to take care of an individual with the challenges OP has described. It is not easy. And the timing is terrible also, after he graduates medical school he‚Äôll be working 100 hour weeks as a resident. There is no way this can work if the fianc√© wants to work outside the home.There should be a day program he can go to for 6 hours a day M-F so his parents get a break each day.Giving the parents a break by taking him in on the occasional weekend is also an option.
ndbv44,Yes. Maybe you can agree he doesn't move in right away but what about in the future?
ndbv44,I'm sorry to tell you, but this sounds like an incompatibility and may mean the end of your relationship...
ndbv44,I agree with this, OP. It‚Äôs okay for her to want to live with her brother, and it is okay for you not to. It just means that you‚Äôre on two different paths. It sucks, but just another example that with relationships sometimes love isn‚Äôt enough. Logistics are very important for a compatible relationship.
ndbv44,This is the answer, OP. I‚Äôm sorry. You‚Äôre not a bad person for wanting this.
nmy29p,Has your therapist mentioned, or have you yourself looked into Maladaptive Daydreaming?
nmy29p,That was going to be my suggestion. It‚Äôs a form of dissociation which can be surprising when you first learn about it but many people use it as a coping skill.
nmy29p,I had no idea others did this or that this is a thing. I do this too, not to OP's extend, but I have to be careful to not let it derail my life.TIL! Thank you for that.
nmy29p,Yeah, that was the first thing I thought of when I read the title.
nmy29p,To what extent is this not normal/typical? I do this, too, but I thought everyone did it. It‚Äôs never interfered with my life as far as I know, although I do tend to be a bit spacey and forgetful. Is this something I should actually be concerned about? Or does everyone do this to a certain extent?
nmy29p,I have never heard if this term before until today and I'm a little worried that I do this. I'm aware of the daydreaming and force myself out of it to pay attention and I tend to be a bit forgetful and spacey. It's not as bad as op but when I was younger going through personal trauma, I used to imagine myself on the moon frequently and often get lost in mind gazing up at it. I guess now would be to figure out if it's just regular daydreaming or maladaptive daydreaming? TIL about maladaptive daydreaming so thank you.
nmy29p,Maladaptive Daydreaming is going to be the title of my autobiography, that's great.
nmy29p,It's common in folks with ADHD, especially adults who were not diagnosed when they were younger. It's a coping mechanism for them.
nmy29p,I can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a name for this. I‚Äôve been doing this for literally as long as I can remember. I‚Äôm never the main character, I‚Äôve kind of had a rotating, progressive and sometimes repeating cast of fictional (often partially plagiarised) characters that have developed over the years, but it‚Äôs like I have literally always had a story that I‚Äôm writing in my head, and it changes every few days, weeks or months depending on how invested I can get.Wow
nmy29p,r/MaladaptiveDreamingWelcome to the club OP, we meet in our imaginations every and any time we feel like, usually between noon and never.
nmy29p,This!! I‚Äôve always done this and it‚Äôs always interfered with my life, but it has presented itself in different ways depending on the circumstances. My daydreams now are about my goals and current life, but when I was in an awful relationship they were exactly like OP‚Äôs.
nmy29p,Thank you for putting a name to this!! I have done this for years and sensed it was unhealthy but never knew how to describe it to anyone.
nmy29p,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs maladaptive. That would mean it‚Äôs preventing her from getting tasks done or getting in the way of other things. I think it is immersive daydreaming.
nmy29p,What about schizoid personality disorder? I was diagnosed with that and one of the main symptoms is preferring to live in your own head rather than in real life and people with schizoid personality disorder can create giant fantasy life‚Äôs to ‚Äúescape reality‚Äù
nmy29p,Maladaptive DaydreamingJesus fucking christ, we can't daydream now???  I mean, living in poverty isn't bad enough, now we have to focus only on reality and suffering?  Fuck whoever came up with this diagnosis!
nmy29p,Oh wow. I thought that it was normal. I talk to my partner about my daydream world frequently. I've had my second world since pre-teens, and I also go by a different name in those daydreams. This is fucked up.
nmy29p,I do this and it is only sometimes harmful imo
kjm5pf,You don't. Stay happy and gitty. Smile and enjoy. He may find it endearing. You'll get comfortable soon enough. In the mean time, have fun.
kjm5pf,Yes. He probably finds it cute that your nervous :)
kjm5pf,Stop overthinking. He‚Äôs in to you. Be you. If he doesn‚Äôt like what that looks like, well it wasn‚Äôt going to go anywhere.
kjm5pf,Definitely this!  It‚Äôs cool to be excited but balancing your expectations goes along with being patient.   Focus more on having fun, how you‚Äôre feeling and communicating.At 3-weeks this more like a tit-for-tat type of relationship.  Whatever you do he should reciprocate and vice versa.
kjm5pf,Yea. Relax and let it be. Learn from the past, but don‚Äôt get balled up by the future. It‚Äôs life, man. Enjoy it.
kjm5pf,I heard bridgette Jones this whole message, and it did work out for her.
kjm5pf,ESTOOOOOOOO, SE TU MISAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
kjm5pf,Remember how great you thought your ex was in the beginning? Allow that hindsight to dial your feelings and expectations back to something more reasonable.
kjm5pf,This is actually good advice, cognitive reframing helps !
kjm5pf,I'm not so sure if this is the right way to go about it. It sounds like in an attempt to dial it back, you're also waiting for it to fail, which would be taking it too far in the other direction.I think it's okay to feel like a teenager because it brings back many wonderful experiences of youth (which just get further away as you get older). He's already gotten to know you with how you've behaved so far. Since he hasn't run away yet, it can't be as bad as you imagine.It sounds like right now, your fears are driven by the oh-my-god-how-did-I-get-so-lucky feeling. But over time, gushing - while flattering - will get old. And your fear of losing him can have subtly damaging effects because it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy simply because you might become too eager to please him.I'd like to think that all of us want an authentic experience in our relationships, so perhaps just take some deep breaths and curb your enthusiasm by just approaching it more maturely, such as just matter-of-factly expressing your appreciation for him. A more measured, positive vibe is  always a welcome experience.Also, take time to share your thoughts and experiences, as he'd like to know more about your inner aspects. And it's okay to agree to disagree. Sometimes the diversity of thought or different perspectives create a richer experience for both of you.I hope that makes sense for you.
kjm5pf,This is great advice, but OP be careful not to temper your excitement too much!  There‚Äôs a fine line that if crosses can end up ruining the chance for something great and short changing this potential partner based solely on your prior experiences.
kjm5pf,Holy crap, this is awful advice. This is just going to lead to fear that any new relationship will eventually become abusive. It‚Äôs also not what OP asked for advice on.Also, infatuation is normal and even expected during the beginning of romantic relationships. It usually fades.
kjm5pf,Honestly, the downsides to my ex were obvious at first. I didn't realize the extent of them, but it was clear he had some anxiety and general neuroticism right off. I even considered not seeing him again and breaking up early on (like at date 2, 3, and month 3) because of it. But you have a good point!Keep it reasonable. And I'm not expecting much right now, really. I just get so flustered I have trouble speaking to him, which is really my main issue.
kjm5pf,imo, this is a great way to sabotage the beginning is something potentially awesome
kjm5pf,I understand why you would give this advice - be realistic! No one is perfect! Take your time! All reasonable and good things to think. However, I think it's could be a damaging suggestion to those with abusive relationships in their past. So, for those who may read this in the way that I did, you are not doomed to repeat your abusive relationship and you do deserve someone who is amazing. There are plenty of partner's who aren't like your ex. As long you put in work to see why the first relationship happened, have a strong support system and listen to your gut, there is no reason why a new relationship couldn't be joyful and respectful and full of love.To OP in particular, you may have some really negative self talk that's a holdover from your shitty, no good ex and the hurt of that relationship. You are probably more attractive than you think you are, and it's not a bad thing to feel butterflies! Take breaths and trust that this nice smart man also has good taste, and spend time seeing if you're compatible. Good luck!
kjm5pf,This. Too many people get caught up in the early relationship and forget a lot of that special feeling is simply brain chemicals firing off. infatuation is a hell of a drug.
kjm5pf,This is great advice!  Thank you!
kjm5pf,I am also an Uruk-hai dating a drop dead gorgeous model-material stunner. This is new relationship energy, bask in it! Just remember when your self esteem drops off a cliff that this man is into YOU. that‚Äôs HIS problem. he‚Äôs allowed to decide to be attracted to you, and you gotta let him! That is all. It‚Äôs taken me three years to get to this point and I‚Äôve needed a lot of validation from him but it‚Äôs so worth it.
m5uznm,The best way to support your family is to support yourself. It sounds selfish, but if you spiral with your family, you won't be able to do anything to help at all.You are under so much pressure, but you are not alone. You can get through this.What can you do to take care of yourself? Would staying with friends or other family help you feel safer? Are you open to speaking with a therapist? Would finding a support group where you can speak with people in similar situations help?Even starting just by opening up to a teacher you trust or a school counselor who can help you find the resources you need could be an excellent first step. But please do what you need to do to keep yourself safe and sane. We love you so much.
m5uznm,In addition to a therapist or school counselor if you have a local library they are used to helping people connect with services like financial assistance for bills, low cost or free mental health services, and of course they have things you can check out that may be of help to you or your family like how to cope with stress. Wishing many positive things come your way OP. It may not feel the most optimistic, but knowing nothing lasts forever has been comforting to me in dark times.
m5uznm,I totally agree with taking care of himself and don't feel it's selfish at all. If we don't self care how can we care for family? We can't. Take care of yourself kid, and listen to this poster. They provided some pretty good pearls here.
m5uznm,This is the best advice! Your school counselor should be able to help find you resources and they are a non-judgmental person to talk to.Wishing you luck, OP. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through all of this!!!
m5uznm,I think this is the best advice you could be given you have to try to muscle through as best you can and get yourself into a good mental space before you can try anything else
m5uznm,The best way to support your family is to support yourself.As someone who had a difficult family situation during my teens, thisthisthis. For me, what helped most was staying out as much as possible (with friends, at the library, etc.) and talking to counsellors.
m5uznm,Just cautioning that teachers and counselors are mandated reporters. Especially if OP is not white (but even if they are), reporting a tough family situation to a mandated reporter can result in placement in foster care. This is something that needs to be tread very carefully. Not saying don't go to them, but please be aware of potential outcomes and make that decision with eyes wide open.
m5uznm,Definitely seconding this. Went through a lot of similar stuff to OP around age 12 and never got therapy for it. It messed me up pretty badly until I finally started therapy on my own at 18. It's taken years of hard work to undo all the unhealthy coping mechanisms I learned to survive my family's absolute mess.I hope OP gets the help they so very much deserve, and I hope they know that none of this is their fault at all.
m5uznm,This 100%. OP will do well if he takes care of himself, ultimately he cannot control his brother's actions and to be honest it will probably mean a lot that one of their sons is well adjusted. They definitely don't want you to be seeing this either.Its a lot of pressure for OP, it can feel horrific to have family turmoil like this.
m5uznm,It‚Äôs normal to want to help your family. It‚Äôs normal to feel guilty that you can‚Äôt help them now because you are 14yo. Spend as much time on sleep overs with relatives and friends as possible. Try to go to summer camp this summer, either as a camper or counselor. Be around as many healthy ppl as possible as much as possible. Join after school activities. Join a homework club. Babysit. Go to the mall. Talk to your youth pastor if you are involved in that world. In short, take care of yourself everyday. Really focus on yourself and your well-being. You will get through this. You will be okay. Take it one day at a time.
m5uznm,This is all such great advice. I was in a similar position around that age and, honestly, what helps more than anything is talking to people and not shutting down.
m5uznm,This is awesome advice. Best thing you can do is take care of yourself so your mom does not have to worry about you, and so you get through this time.I had parents who struggled with depression in my teens. Something that was a lifesaver for me was working at overnight summer camps. Take a look at job applications now (hopefully not all cancelled this year). They are wonderful places to get away from the stresses of the outside world, make amazing friends (simply through the shared experience), and have a great time.Check it out. Spend as much time outside of the house if you can.
m5uznm,Great advice. Staying out as much as possible (with friends, at the library, etc. ‚Äì not getting into trouble) and being around positive people really helped me when I was in this situation.
m5uznm,i feel like I should be mad at the wholesome award but that actually gave me a good laugh lmfao
m5uznm,Your father and mother are going through something similar my parents went through. My father was diagnosed with schizophrenia when I was a kid. He took off. This was back in the 90s (I'm 31).People get into cycles that can only be broken through self improvement. But self improvement is the hardest thing any of us will ever do especially when you are in such a dark place.It sounds cliche but your family needs positivity, encouragement, strength and understanding. I hope your parents can find the strength to understand each other for the sake of you and your brother.Try to understand your parents and not harbour too much resentment. That will eat you up from within.I got more advice if you have questions.
m5uznm,About the only advice I can give is don't drink, smoke, toke, or do drugs. Don't even do it once. Addiction sneaks up on you. You don't even realize it until it's too late, and then you're stuck with it even if you quit and go sober. It really screws up your life.The reason I'm giving you this advice is because you seem to be at the perfect point in your life for addiction to strike. I can't give advice to fix what's going on in your life, but I can give advice on how to avoid what has screwed up my life.
m5uznm,As another recovered addict, hard agree. Plus because the brother has already headed down that path, it‚Äôs possible there‚Äôs a genetic predisposition thrown in there
m5uznm,Exactly this op. With so much going on itll be very easy for you to seek relief through these things as well and fall prey to addiction.As many people have mentioned this isnt something for you to fix. As much as it weighs heavily on you there isnt anything you can do for them. Focus on what you can do, work on yourself and your potential future.
m5uznm,This goes right along with hanging out with crappy people. Stable good kind friends will help you and support you through these hard times. Bad friends will easily drag you down under the guise of friendship and comradery. You are still a good person and you still have the power to control a great deal about your life.
m5uznm,Im in recovery. My family's fucked up situation post 2008 crash was the trigger.OP please follow this advice. Wait until youre 25 and in a good situation before you try any substance if you can.
m5uznm,Word. I started picking up addictions in a similar situation and, huge shocker, it made things worse.
nspxj4,It sounds like he views this as an activity that you two are doing together, so if you're not engaged he tries to fix the activity so you enjoy it too and become re-engaged. I think you should talk about this away from watching tv and with more detail than "I'm not a tv person." Like say, "I really don't care for tv  but I feel connected to you while we relax in the same room. I really am ok just doing my own thing while you watch tv." You might ask him how he views the tv watching, also consider whether you guys have a time to connect together every evening apart from this.
nspxj4,I 100% agree with this. I love nothing more then doing nothing in the same room as my fianc√©. He‚Äôs using playing elder scrolls online (which I just started played and is an awesome game) and I‚Äôll do homework or crochet or whatever else. He‚Äôll let me know when the games about to get interesting and I‚Äôll talk to him about whatever I‚Äôm reading for school.
nspxj4,It took me a while to get over my husband reading articles on his phone during our shared TV time, lol. It sounds dumb but tv watching was always a social activity for my siblings and me.I think your bf will eventually be able to make peace with this idea, but it might take some time. I liked the suggestion to talk about this idea before tv time. Just let him know this is your way of relaxing and he will have to adjust his idea of relaxing so you both can relax in ways you enjoy.
nspxj4,I really agree with this comment.Each time my partner asks if we should pause the tv, I‚Äôve come to remind myself that they just want to feel more ‚Äútogether‚Äù with me, which is so sweet. So sometimes, I make the compromise and decide to be fully engaged with them even if I wasn‚Äôt that into the tv, I‚Äôm into being with them. Sometimes though, I‚Äôll say whichever one of these is fitting:I‚Äôm really glad you‚Äôre enjoying the tv, I enjoy just being next to you and I also need to decompress right now so I might be on my phone sometimes.I need/want to do a few things so I‚Äôm going to try to pay attention and do these things for myself.I‚Äôm really glad we get to sit down together, even if we‚Äôre not entirely doing the same things.And sometimes, if I know myself well enough, I‚Äôll make a preface before we even turn the tv on: ‚Äúhey, I might be doing some other things while the tv is on. How do you feel about that?‚ÄùAlso some have mentioned parallel play ‚Äî I cherish that kind of hanging out with my partner! It‚Äôs another valid form of intimacy.Also you should have conversations about how you want to intentionally spend time together. You might find new ways to respect one another. Or you might find new things to do together.
nspxj4,It's 100% this, I do exactly the same with my girlfriend because I view it as something we're enjoying together. In fact often I suggest stuff I've already seen because I think she'll enjoy it, and if she's sitting there on her phone I'm basically rewatching something by myself.
nspxj4,This! My husband and I had to have this exact talk when we moved in together. Saved a lot of hurt feelings
nspxj4,This is very astute.My boyfriend is the same way. He really likes to watch a bit of TV at night to wind down and I rarely ever watch TV on my own and don‚Äôt really get into shows either. He sees it as a nice thing to do together, I.e. relaxing with each other and spending quality time and I see it as a waste of time and kind of mind-numbing lol. So you just have to understand where the other person is coming from. Maybe you can find a new TV show you guys really like and watch that instead, or you do what relmamanick suggests and tell your boyfriend that your idea of quality time is doing separate things together to relax. He probably just doesn‚Äôt understand your POV and really thinks you‚Äôre bored.
nspxj4,The question"why is this important to you?" can help both of you understand.I wanted to watch football as a family but they kept wandering off. I figured out that it reminds me of my childhood and being in the same room as a family with football on: pleasant memories. Once they understood what it meant to me, they started hanging around. Made me feel loved. I sorta like football but I really liked the family feel.
nspxj4,Yeah being able to be together but doing different things is just an important relationship skill in general.
nspxj4,I agree with this. Sometimes it's as easy as finding something you can both connect on and enjoy as part of your unwinding routine. But also understanding what you each get out of it.Hubs and I watch certain YouTubers. Once, I said I was going to fold laundry during it. But he put way more emphasis on the sitting together and enjoying it than I did. I would still be watching, but not sitting. While the sitting in proximity was important to him. He folded the laundry while I was doing bedtime stuff with the kids. It was really sweet, but also made me realize that he was placing value on different aspects of the watching than I was, and part of what made it enjoyable for him was the calmly sitting close together. While I'm fine with bopping about and folding laundry, I'm also cool with enjoying our YouTube fun and eating ice cream or sipping tea and I can fold laundry either after that "show" or when he's playing video games. This is an easy compromise, because he made it an easy compromise, but also because I have more insight to what he enjoys about it.This may not be the case for OP, as she doesn't enjoy the shows themselves or watching TV. They should discuss what are some ways to decompress that they both fully enjoy.
nspxj4,Exactly. I have never understood why it‚Äôs more bonding to stare at the same screen/ device vs zoning out to different ones, or reading or drawing.
nspxj4,I agree with this take. I also think it would be a good idea to establish a line of trust. As in telling him that you will let him know if you want him to put something else on or if you're bored.Let him know that if you aren't enjoying "blank"  that you would voice it out or leave.So that when you don't, he doesn't have to worry.
nspxj4,This is better advice than my abrupt version above.
nspxj4,You should look up the term ‚Äúparallel play‚Äù it‚Äôs used in child psych but definitely can apply to adults too. You can spend time in the same room doing something else and not necessarily engaging with each other (or in your case watching a tv show with your attention undivided) whereas for him that‚Äôs a problem. So he sees you as being detached or bored of the relationship, not necessarily the tv show. I think it‚Äôs possible to talk through this issue if you‚Äôre both willing.
nspxj4,Are you me? I‚Äôve had the exact same discussion with my fianc√©! We even had a fight about it. I didn‚Äôt understand why he was so offended because I wasn‚Äôt into watching tv with him every evening, he didn‚Äôt understand why I was on my phone or fidgeting with other things while watching tv.When I lived alone I almost never watched tv, when he lived alone he watched movies all the time.We made a compromise that we watch certain shows together and then I give it an hour of my undivided attention (not every evening) and he doesn‚Äôt get pissed when I don‚Äôt want to continue watching after the hour is up. I had to realise that for him watching tv together is a bonding activity and it‚Äôs rude to be on my phone then, and he had to realise that I just don‚Äôt feel the same interest in watching tv as he does.
nspxj4,Another one here! My SO wants to watch tv every single night and he asks what I want to watch - the answer is always "I don't care" because my REAL answer is "nothing". I don't watch TV, in the mornings I'll have the news on before I go to work and in the evening I'm doing chores or hobbies until bed. I didn't have TV and rarely used Netflix before I moved in with him.But every night without fail, he'll ask, I'll have no answer. And if I DO actually have an answer for once, I put it on, and HE gets bored and leaves. So I turn it off, he comes back and asks if I'm bored, and it repeats. What?! I just don't understand.If he chooses, he watches repeats of shows forever. I can list his top 5 shows he's seen every episode of multiple times. If I ask him to pick something new then it ends up literally over an hour of him scrolling through everything trying to find the perfect thing. By the time he chooses something it's bedtime, and then he'll fall asleep with it on and I'm already in bed.I just don't enjoy it. I sit on my laptop, read, or play games while he watches TV so it's not like I'm not there. It's just so boring to me. It's a waste of my evening. Also my parents only hobby together I ever saw them doing growing up was watching tv, and that just seems so sad.
nspxj4,Saaaaaame I didn't grow up with a TV, and I've never owned my own. It just so rarely occurs to me to watch anything! And it always puts me to sleep. I spend all day staring at a screen at work, plus the time I spend staring at my phone afterwards. I have no desire to spend my remaining time staring at another screen. I've run into this problem with every partner I've had. My current one gets it and is happy to watch TV while I do my own thing. My ex was the worst because he's an animator so he took it almost as a personal insult if I didn't want to watch cartoons with him, like I was saying his work wasn't important.
nspxj4,I‚Äôm you‚Äôre fianc√©. TV time after dinner was how my parents and I hung out and unwound. My parents weren‚Äôt awesome, but that time was usually peaceful and nice. So TV time at the end of the day with my husband feels soothing and helps me relax and feel close to him. He doesn‚Äôt love TV, but he gets that I enjoy the time so he gets through it. We‚Äôve found other ways to enjoy that quiet alone/together time that is more enjoyable for him as well. Meets the emotional need for me and is fun for him.
lnciku,Girl you're still worried about sparing her feelings after all of this??? Just be honest with her that the way she acts with you is unacceptable and you're not interested in continuing this friendship
lnciku,It also sounds like she's having an emotional affair with OP's ex and only wants OP there to make it less "affairy".
lnciku,Exactly. She needs to learn how to interact with people properly and the only way to learn is by being told you're making a mistake. Rip the bandaid off.
lnciku,Thank you thank you thank you. Why the hell are you worried about her feelings when you don‚Äôt even want her in your life? You don‚Äôt need to put her through the wringer, you need to be your honest self and tell her what‚Äôs on your mind. She‚Äôs a big girl, with big girl feelings, and big girl words.
lnciku,Seriously. I'll never understand how people are so worried about sparing the feelings of someone who obviously doesn't care about their own.
lnciku,I was gonna say this! Also hard to not hurt someone‚Äôs feelings when you tell them you don‚Äôt want to be their friend anymore, but that‚Äôs better than staying in a toxic friendship
lnciku,This is exactly right!! You need to have a good talk with yourself about why you would care if you ' hurt her feelings'! She is a terrible person, and the farthest thing from a friend. Even if she miraculously realized that it's weird and wrong to want to hang out with your ex, AND tell you about it...she still would be the weird girl that did that and she could never actually be your friend. Just because she wants to hang out with you, does make you obligated you to be nice to her. Cut her off, tell her why, let her be mad or hurt. Fill your life with positive people and don't ever apologize for not letting people drag you around being uncomfortable and creeped out.
lnciku,Yes, 100% what is stopping you from just telling the truth. You're writing a novel in the description but lass, easy enough to tell her this is fucking weird to her face? And them, as a result of this very weird behaviour, we can't be froemds. Sorry. Due to aforementioned, extreme weirdness I hate to blame you but I have to blame you. SAY IT TO HER. If you complain about this but stay her friend, you're weird too. All round NOPE
lnciku,I wonder how her husband would feel or if he even knows about this guy...
lnciku,My initial thought. If I ever heard my SO say "man if I were single" a thousand times I'd have dumped his ass so quick.
lnciku,Yeah total emotional affair. Steer clear of this Trainwreck.
lnciku,Do you want to say something to her because I would just ghost her, she‚Äôs not your friend, she‚Äôs likely having an affair with your ex and is trying to throw it in your face. She only wants you to come around if he is around as an excuse for her husband. Cut ties and move on.
lnciku,I wish I could upvote this more than once. You're totally right. Not to mention op talks about telling her friend "what he did to her" which is never a good thing. Her "friend" betrayed her after she had all the facts and still pursued some kind of relationship with him and expected her to just go along with it.Honestly op you should tell her husband that something fishy is going on and then tell her that she is not your friend anymore because she clearly doesn't respect people beyond her own gain.
lnciku,This is it!! She‚Äôs litterally using you as an excuse to hang out with her crush. Don‚Äôt let yourself be manipulated!
lnciku,Yes! I would just block & move on to be honest.
lnciku,I know you "can't tell people who to be friends with," but someone who cozies up to your pain and rubs salt in the wound isn't a friend."I respect and care for you, but think we've had boundary problems recently.Poopface is still a sore subject to me after the way he treated me. I've made that clear, but you continue to disrespect both your husband and me by speaking about him in a way I find inappropriate.  I care for you, but think it would be best if we took some time apart for now."
lnciku,Very well-worded! OP, say something like this. It‚Äôs clear, straight to the point, and doesn‚Äôt leave any room for her to ‚Äúmisunderstand‚Äù you.
lnciku,Why are you still friends with her? She is having an affair with your ex behind her husbands back.
lnciku,Tell her she is being insensitive and rude, because she is. That is not how you support someone who has just gone through a breakup.
lnciku,Why do you even give a shit about her feelings, block her and move on with your life
i4bc5g,Are you excited about a future with him? Is he excited about a future with you?Also, the pandemic has cast a cold winter on even the rosiest of relationships (my fiance and I are incredibly in love but we have both been miserable to varying degrees over the last few months). Do you think that could be having an impact on either one of you?
i4bc5g,Do you think that if they aren‚Äôt excited about a future with each other they should break up? Genuine question! Promise I‚Äôm not trying to be snarky!
i4bc5g,Is nobody going to point out that he's possibly depressed? Change in behavior, lack of emotions, empathy, and compassion. Change in sex drive. I would have to wonder, has his productivity at work decreased? Have there been changes to his appetite or sleep patterns?He mentions that he's tired or had a hard day at work. The world is crazy right now. We're still in the middle of a pandemic and the emotional toll that leaves is huge. Nothing at all looks the same anymore. Everyone has had to cope with the loss of reality, and that is not an easy thing to deal with at all.I agree, it could be any number of things. It could have to do with the relationship, a fear of commitment and cold feet. You need to talk to him, OP, and you also need to see if this goes out further than you. How does he interact with his friends? Is he even interacting with his friends? You need to keep an eye on him, and remind him that he can talk to you. Please direct him towards resources that can help him if you are concerned.
i4bc5g,If his work involves any social service element, we have been under constant stress for the last six months trying to solve emergent issues with no break and ever changing rules.  If he is suffering from compassion fatigue, then he has nothing left to give at the end of the day.  And I mean... nothing.  I had to force vacation time on myself to reset.  I‚Äôm never going to catch up on emails, but it was worth it.
i4bc5g,This is exactly what I thought when I read through the post. He seems to be exhibiting signs of depression. I also recommend sitting down and speaking with him about it. It certainly can‚Äôt hurt.
i4bc5g,idk i just dont think depression can excuse his response of "nah im not answering that, you're just being needy" when asked for verbal validation from his own partner. theres uninterested from depression and then theres straight up being clearly unconcerned for any needs his partner might have. if being depressed means he no longer gives a shit for his partner and her needs then whats gonna happen in the future if he gets depressed again
i4bc5g,Exactly this! My partner has depression and when it hits them bad they mirror a lot of the things that OP has mentioned. If we didn't communicate about how he was going and how it's effecting him then our relationship would be in a much worse state.
i4bc5g,OP, have you had an honest conversation about the state of your relationship with him?Until then, you have zero idea what's going on in his head. Try to talk to him first, because I can't comment on any of this without his perspective.Most arguments in relationships also stem from assumptions about how someone feels without direct communication.
i4bc5g,Reddit isn't who you should be asking, your fiance is!You list a bunch of issues (no date nights, no non-sexual touch, no sexual touch, aggressive response when asked for support) and do not indicate you have brought these issues up and can communicate about them.He mostly says he‚Äôs just super stressed and anxious from work.Or he's terrified of marriage and too cowardly to tell you that and see if you two can connect working through his concerns.There's clearly a communication gap going on and it's equally yours and his.  Just leaving him seems ridiculous when you have not addressed this larger communication failure in your relationship -- it will happen in other relationships.  Get some books on marriage and communication (Gottman specifically) and read it through, then ask that you and your husband-to-be talk to each other.
i4bc5g,I don‚Äôt want to get downvoted to hell for sharing my two cents, and maybe people have had different experiences with books and seminars, but when I actively sought out a Gottman trained therapist it was almost like signing up for a time share. The first appointment he spent explaining the whole shebang, which I had already researched but ok, I get. The second appointment he spent explaining why we had to pay extra for the online quiz... like, therapy isn‚Äôt cheap and you just wasted 2 sessions without even getting to know us personally. Switched therapists and she jumped right in first session and had us addressing some major issues right off the bat.
i4bc5g,There's clearly a communication gap going on and it's equally yours and his.  Just leaving him seems ridiculous when you have not addressed this larger communication failureIt‚Äôs not equal at all. In fact, as you mention in your post, when OP brings it up he says:He mostly says he‚Äôs just super stressed and anxious from work.So that is obvious communication on OPs part. Even you found his response to her attempt at communication to be trash so you go on to make assumptions:Or he's terrified of marriage and too cowardly to tell you that and see if you two can connect working through his concerns.If that‚Äôs true, then it‚Äôs his responsibility as an adult male to say that. It‚Äôs not up to you or Reddit to diagnose a man who is treating her like a burden and a nuisance and then just says ‚Äúi dunno I‚Äôm stressed‚Äù when she asks.Getting continuously rejected for dates, conversations, romance and sex communicates a lot.My advice to OP is to sit him down and let him know what he does and how it makes you feel. Once he tries to butt in with his BS excuses just say, I hear you, and if work is too stressful I‚Äôd love to work with you on how to destress. But I‚Äôm just letting you know this is not an acceptable life style for me, I don‚Äôt feel appreciated or heard. What do you need from me to change that?We have to stop pretending that if we just tell our partners to stop telling us to shut up on date nights, that they‚Äôll be able to unpack all their issues and fix themselves.If you‚Äôre treating someone like shit and you blow them off when they bring it up, don‚Äôt be surprised when they dump you. Maybe don‚Äôt feel so entitled to being blatantly disrespectful and both emotionally and sexually distant just cause you don‚Äôt expect them to leave. It‚Äôs not fair to trap people like that.Tell him how you feel and if he mocks you or dismisses you again leave. If he apologizes watch for actual changed behavior.
i4bc5g,This should be the top comment. Until you talk to him, this is all speculation and guess work. We haven‚Äôt been in your relationship to know; and I don‚Äôt get the impression that you‚Äôve sat down and asked him frankly what is going on.Tell him what you told us. Tell him that his lack of effort in the relationship is hurting you. Ask him what‚Äôs going on and if somethings been bothering him, or is there‚Äôs something he‚Äôs not getting out of the relationship.From experience, a lot of men are less emotive than women; they go silent and bottle things up instead of talking about them.Don‚Äôt assume the relationship is ‚Äúdead‚Äù until you talk to your fianc√©. No one here has a right to tell you that no matter what they‚Äôve been through personally.
i4bc5g,Which gottman books do you recommend?
i4bc5g,Seconding Gottman!!I went to a weekend workshop by Gottman Institute, it helped soooo much
i4bc5g,You said that so much more eloquently than I could. For sure, talk to him about it. You've been together for years, and a good proportion of that was long distance. Maybe talking will reignite the communication & connection you obviously had to get this far?Sending positive vibes!
i4bc5g,Talk to him and see what‚Äôs going on. Be genuine and express your feelings. If he‚Äôs still closed off then end it.
kqdcl7,Can I ask which book you read?
kqdcl7,Sure! It's called "Coping with Difficult People", by Robert M. Bramsom, Ph.D.
kqdcl7,I was gonna the same thing
kqdcl7,Good for you. You learn to be a better coworker. And your problem magically goes away. That's a double win.
kqdcl7,Paralegal here, difficult people is one of the reasons I came up with checklists for each file I work on. Want to start a file, here is a preliminary checklist for me to run due diligence on, I need all the information to start ... happy to help once this is complete.Then once I hand back the due diligence with reports, here is a list of documents we can create on this file, please let me know what drafts you want started or you have additional data from the client. That way it is all in their handwriting / email, plus I can double check and refer back to it.Also lawyers like that really do not last, glad you got rid of yours. If they get outright rude, report to HR - I once just forwarded a voice mail to the head of HR and got an apology from the lawyer an hour later.
kqdcl7,Legal administrator here- attorneys are not trained as managers and yet are expected to be! I 100% use checklists and notate my work. I write down when I had conversations with people and often email confirmations after conversations. ‚ÄúMs Smith, here is the list of action items I write down after our meeting, can you make sure I have everything?‚ÄùI would also suggest getting some project management training. See if HR has money set aside for employee development
kqdcl7,This is awesome that you grew professionally/personally, but also had the best resolution yet!I was fired I'm 2013 by a manager I could NOT stand. She was awful. Yelled. Slammed doors. Threw things. Would warn us (note: "us"=three women) that she "is PMSing and it is NOT safe to cross her today. General unprofessional crap. Plus she didn't know wtf she was doing in 90% of her role. All her subordinates were far more qualified for ours and her role than she was for any of it.I ended up in her crosshairs and got the boot. It triggered the single worst depressive episode of my life and also pushed me to give up my dream of pursuing med school. In searching for a new job, I finally landed an interview at my current institution and the HR manager who started the long interview process learned that I was fired, asked a few questions about it and said in response to my surprise that my honest disclosure wasn't ending the interview: We understand that some managers end up in roles in which they don't belong, either due to lack of qualifications or immaturity. It's no reason to hold against you in an isolated event.And the reason I share that story with you isn't, obviously bc your situation's outcome was similar to mine, but bc I think it's helpful for you and any other reader to remember that not all managers deserve that role. Sometimes HR should be involved; sometimes you need to employ ideas discussed by the book OP mentioned.OP, I'm glad your story has a happier (I think!) outcome than mine and I hope you don't need to use what you learned in the book again! I look forward to checking it out!
kqdcl7,Oof yeah, I've had that boss in the past! But weirdly, that was easier to deal with- I guess when you know someone is way out of line then you don't internalize it as much?
kqdcl7,Also check out techniques and skills in ‚Äúmanaging up‚Äù and ‚Äúmanaging your manager‚Äù.
kqdcl7,Hopefully you're never in that situation again, but glad to see you found a way to work as much around it as you could and very glad to hear you won't have to deal with her at all anymore. I bet both of those things felt satisfying - but the latter probably moreso. ;)
kqdcl7,Glad to hear you‚Äôve taken control and made things better for yourself !! And sounds as if they have got what you deserved.
kqdcl7,I'm glad you don't have to deal with this any more but it's useful experience to have because almost every office seems to have one of these people ;-)
kqdcl7,Hopefully your next manager is easier to deal with, but at the very least you have now learned useful skills that can be transferred to other difficult interpersonal relationships.Glad things are looking up!
kqdcl7,Nice! I also work at law firms, and have had difficult people as well. It‚Äôs hard because the work demands that everything be done correctly the first time, and if someone doesn‚Äôt give full instructions it is really hard to follow through/follow through the way they want. Congrats on the relief :)
kqdcl7,Unless you are the problem, you can assume the person you are having conflict with is the problem.  If you can direct that persons attention towards someone other than you, they will no longer be your problem and will be someone elses.If they are that big of an idiot, time will sort them out without you getting too involved.I run massive teams of people for one of the largest companies in the world.  That's how I roll.
kqdcl7,Definitely check out the Ask A Manager website too, it's super helpful
kqdcl7,Honestly I have left jobs for less. Condescension like what your original post described makes my blood boil.Glad they cleaned house, and the book sounds very helpful, thanks for sharing!
kqdcl7,What was one thing you did that you think helped the most?
kqdcl7,Basically, I just concentrated on getting myself out of the mentality that this difficult attorney was my "enemy" so that I could stop taking it so personally when she'd correct or condescend me. I actually made a word document for myself where I wrote down a few "rules" for dealing with her, I'll copy-paste it here:[Attorney Name] is not treating me with malice; she is not aware that her style of communication/management is harmful to me.[Attorney Name] communicates in this same manner with everyone and in all situations; I cannot take it personally nor can I expect it to change.Asking question after question until [Attorney Name]‚Äôs instructions are clarified is the only way to get around the problem of her poor communication skills; I need to stop thinking of this as an annoying extra step and instead think of it as enacting a solution.The main hurdle to my asking clarifying questions is my dislike of speaking with [Attorney Name]. I am already angry with her before the conversation even begins, making me not want to initiate necessary further conversation. The solution is to let go of my hatred for [Attorney Name] and have a ‚Äúfresh start‚Äù where I am no longer already angry at the prospect of receiving an assignment from her.I must accept that back-and-forth and clarification is an immutable part of communicating with [Attorney Name] and not attempt to avoid it, as that only leads to me being angry that it ‚Äúhappened anyway‚Äù.
klzbtg,Please stay strong. You've taken the first step but I assure you your insecure boyfriend will be begging you, promising you everything under the sun. It is smoke and mirrors. You gave him 4 year to straighten up and he wasted them on booze and other women. It was not a mistake. He is just pure pond scum. You can and will do so much better. You owe it to yourself to stay strong and to find the man of your dreams. Work on yourself. Any time you think of him or your past, so something positive for yourself.
klzbtg,I‚Äôm so happy for you girl. Been in that type of toxic and fucked up relationship before. It‚Äôs time to work on yourself and detox from all the shit he‚Äôs put you through. Tomorrow is going to be a brighter day. And remember, NEVER allow anyone to treat you like that ever again. Anxiety or not. - someone who also struggles with severe anxiety
klzbtg,I‚Äôm proud of you. Stay strong and know you deserve love and respect.
klzbtg,So proud of you!!! i promise you will feel much better soon
klzbtg,This is the best Christmas gift you could have given yourself. Now stay strong. 2021 will be lighter
klzbtg,Its the best thing you could have done - great to go into the new year without dead weight!Staying with a cheater 99 times out of 100 just leads to bitterness, resentment and pain and is usually a waste of time as months/years down the line the relationship falters. You've saved yourself all of that and known your value. Its not easy,  so well done.
klzbtg,So proud of you. And I hope you know that you are enough. None of this is your fault and there‚Äôs nothing you could said or done that would have changing his cheating ways üíï
klzbtg,Be on the lookout for hysterical bonding and DO NOT let yourself fall for it. This immediate post breakup period, he will likely pull out all the stops to convince you to stay. It won‚Äôt last.
klzbtg,This is a very good point
klzbtg,GOOD IM SO PROUD OF YOU
klzbtg,Good for you! Leaving is the hardest part and you did it!
klzbtg,You will find someone that will be there for you through all of your ups and downs and not make your mental illness about him. I‚Äôm sorry you have to go through this, but I‚Äôm hopeful for you and your new freedom üíú
klzbtg,Congratulations! I hope you enjoy ringing in the fresh, new year.
klzbtg,Good for you! You deserve better!
klzbtg,Good for you too many people don't take this step for fear of the unknown, but trust me it's much better on the other side
klzbtg,Yes!! Your original post made me so sad. As someone with horrible mental health issues who has been happily with my partner, who has never cheated or in any way berated me for it, for over a decade‚Äîif someone loves you, they don‚Äôt use your illness as an excuse to treat you poorly. You deserve SO much better, and I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôve realized that!
klzbtg,Good job!! Best Christmas gift to yourself! Now you can start 2021 with way better energy and leave him in the dust.
klzbtg,Good for you! Now watch your mental health sky rocket.
klzbtg,Great job! Self care is wonderful.  You're brave and smart.
klzbtg,Awesome way to start your new year! Not gonna lie, its going to be painful and there will likely be times you feel lonely and want to answer his calls or text him- but don't. As someone else with anxiety, once you meet someone who actually treats you right you will be floored at how much easier and nicer and just generally great it is. In the meantime, enjoy that freedom and enjoy time with those who love you enough to respect you. Proud of you :)
iju35i,Pro tip: you can practice naming your emotions. Maybe you can do that every day, take some time to think and identify how you are feeling. You can even keep a journal.
iju35i,This is a good idea.It helps you to take the role of observer of your own emotions, and that can help when you feel overwhelmed by them. Plus it helps you recognize different emotions and feelings in yourself and others, which makes you able to sympathize and empathize with others.
iju35i,A journal and practice naming feelings can be so helpful, especially for men like OP who have been trained to suppress their emotions for so long. It‚Äôs such a disservice we are doing to men because when we refuse to allow them to express and process emotions, we stunt their emotional development. I think it‚Äôs straight up abusive to deprive boys of this vital life skill. OP kind of has to start from the beginning, and approach his emotions the way a child might. A journal can be a way for him to practice identifying his feelings. What happened today? How did I feel about that? Was that feeling good or bad? When are other times I felt like this? Why do I think I feel this way when that happens? It‚Äôs basic stuff but it‚Äôs surprisingly effective.
iju35i,Start with the four primary emotions, which are analogous to the primary colors.  They are sadness, happiness, anger and fear.  Identify which of those four you're feeling.  Eventually you can start breaking them down further, but start there.
iju35i,Great advice. If you can't name them download a Feeling Wheel, it really helps to identify and name them.
iju35i,Ah, I see you've discovered the crying headache, drink lots of water and sleep that's the way to get rid of it
iju35i,the crying headacheI didn't know it had a name! Thank you
iju35i,For me it's like this tiredness settles over me for the rest of the day.  I can't do anything too strenuous; I have to do comforting things.  Stardew Valley, books, cuddle with my boyfriend.  My eyes feel tired.Just how it goes.  Crying is an important stress reliever; it's good to be able to cry, to let out some of the sadness.
iju35i,I can tell you from experience bottling up your feelings only ends in pain and hurt. At 22 your probably thinking  im fine but if you keep doing that for say another 20 years you will implode.Its not healthy and you should and need to find away to cope express and deal with those feelings. In a positive way.
iju35i,Oh, I don't think I can keep it up for ONE more year, let alone 20!I'm trying to. I can't afford therapy right now, so I'm looking to other guidance online.
iju35i,Just like John mulaney said (paraphrased): ‚Äúas an Irish person, I just keep my feelings over here, and then one day I‚Äôll die.‚Äù
iju35i,I‚Äôm in my late 20s. I still bottle everything up. Being in healthcare during this year has been absolutely, couple with family stuff and I‚Äôm a powder keg ready to blow. It‚Äôs definitely not a good idea to bottle everything inside.
iju35i,I didn't know Katie's mom very well, and my own mom even less, but based on how everyone described her, Katie was doing an AMAZING job of living through her mom's legacy of love and kindness. For the first time in ages, I felt like my feelings mattered.Tell Katie that. Hell, text it to her now. If someone felt that way about me and told me so? I'd carry those words in my heart the rest of my life.I'm so happy you have someone as amazing as Katie in your life, and I'm happy for her that she has you. You are a good person.
iju35i,Yes, please tell her how she helped you. I will say though, don't forget she's going through a tough time as well, she might need to lean on you also. I realise you said you don't have money for therapy, but do whatever you can to help yourself with HEALTHY strategies going forward (good advice in this thread for a lot of that actually), so that she doesn't become your only source of support, as that can be a lot to take on for any person but especially during times of grief. Ideally, you should be your own biggest fan with her to support you and vice versa.
iju35i,Hey man. I'm 21F and i have SUCH a hard time showing my emotions to others. Not for the same reasons, since i'm not a man, but because i often had to be the caretaker for my siblings and my father would ridicule me for crying when he would yell at me.I'm learning about how to open up too. It's hard. It's so hard. But my girlfriend is a lot like Katie - she's very patient and she *listens* to me, which is something I need. I really hope you guys can stay together for a long, long time.My advice? Sometimes it's nice to schedule a time to cry! If something hard happens or if you're just having a rough day for mundane reasons, say to yourself "alright, at 3pm i'm going to be by myself and have a nice cry". It's super cathartic and it can really help you normalize crying to yourself. :)
iju35i,Oh wow. I'm so sorry you were treated that way. The idea of women being told they couldn't cry was something I thought simply didn't happen (or at least extremely rarely.)I've been working on trying allowing myself to feel when I'm at home, but it's been slow going. I want to let myself cry, but then I remember all the horrible memories associated with it, especially my father getting angry with me or other people picking on me, and I'm too scared to let the tears out. It's like I'm afraid my father's gonna jump out somewhere, and scold me for crying like he did when I was a kid, even though I'm an adult now!
iju35i,Hey nephew, courage and vulnerability are two sides of the same coin.  Good work.  You deserve to be free of that weight.   Keep going.
iju35i,Just wanted to pitch in and validate that yeah, she‚Äôs a keeper. Take care of her.... and yourself. It‚Äôll be hard at first but exploring your emotions will eventually become natural, even enjoyable should you choose so.
jq4p0f,I think you should talk to her, maybe even write to her.My guess is that she doesn't know what to expect from you. So, in my family, there is no such thing as generosity. If a gift seems generous, then there are ALWAYS strings attached. She told your son that she's afraid because she doesn't know what you want from her in return. So she felt obligated to reciprocate the gift evenly because she doesn't have any experience with generosity.My mother in law is a truly generous woman. And the first Christmas I did with her was incredibly confusing. She gave me SOOO many gifts. And of course I had brought her something, her son helped me pick it out. But it was one gift, and she'd bought me a house full. And because my family does gifting with strings, it was very uncomfortable.So, my advice is to be very frank with her if you want to buy her any gifts or give her any money. Tell her the real reasons you want to do this for her and ask her if she's comfortable before you give her anything.Edited to add- Thank you for the silver kind friend
jq4p0f,This is excellent advice. My mother is abusive and it is EXACTLY like this. Any gift received comes with strings. Guilt, abuse, shame. It's so hard to let that go. The first time my mother-in-law bought a gift for my birthday I cried from sheer panic. What did this mean? What would she expect? How long before I was made to feel guilty for the burden of purchasing me the gift? How could I possibly even the playing field by getting her something equally expensive?I didn't even want gifts from my partner, nevermind a woman who barely knew me.Talking to her is really the best bet. If you think she'd be more comfortable with a letter, that's fine too. Just explaining that you care for her, that you're there for her. When my mother-in-law finally explained to me that she felt I was no different than her own daughter, that she'd been introducing me as her daughter for months, and she wanted to treat me as such- well. It wasn't an instant fix. But it made it easier. I still had a lot to work through. But feeling safe with a person takes time and effort. And talking helped.Over time, you'll be able to show her that you're safe.
jq4p0f,I am sorry. I do love to buy gifts but I should be more aware of how it looks to her. Thank you for sharing this. It is more helpful than you know
jq4p0f,This.  She is probably used to being manipulated, so she is seeing this as a form of manipulation.  She might be thinking that if she always reciprocates in kind, then no one owes anyone else anything.  Or, she is just trying to please you because she thinks you'll hate her or punish her otherwise.I think the first direction of approach should be a hand-written letter.  That is something that she can read and digest on her own time and at her own speed.  A face-to-face conversation might be intimidating to her.  Simple physical affection like hugs also go a long way.If you are looking for a way to help her in the form of some sort of fiduciary way, I would suggest contacting the bursar office of her college and paying for a portion of her tuition.  Maybe a class or two.  Maybe some overdue debt that she owes.If you do it anonymously, then when she goes to pay a tuition bill, and they tell her that she has a credit on her account, she might just think, "Heh.  Okay.  I must have overpaid somewhere".  Or, if she catches on, then she might realize that you are trying to help her better herself, that you are a source of safety and security for her, and that gifts do not have attachments.
jq4p0f,What if he did something for her through his son? Do you think that would remove some of the burden?
jq4p0f,Also, OP could explain that gift giving is one of their love languages and that it's just them showing love. I used to be incredibly uncomfortable with gifts due to my childhood and one of the main ways my partner and his family show love is with gifts. Once I made that connection it was easier for me to accept
jq4p0f,omg how awful! I didn't even consider this, but sounds like it's a common family dynamic, based on the comments here. Gifts should be a time to enjoy each other's generosity :/ This is probably exactly what's going on in the gf's mind: She was stuttering and panicking because she was stressed over being able to reciprocate the gift with one of similar value! Seesh how sad...
jq4p0f,I love this.I come from a poor family and my in laws are incredibly generous. It made me so uncomfy at first because I thought it would come with strings or if I didn‚Äôt reciprocate (because my husband and I aren‚Äôt  wealthy)Her love language is gift giving. It‚Äôs how she shows her love and she likes to do it.
jq4p0f,I also came from an abusive home, and I have always had difficulty with receiving gifts, especially expensive ones. In my home growing up, gifts weren't given without strings attached. Any time I did something considered "wrong," I was reminded of the gifts I'd received or things that were done for me in years past and called ungrateful, or worse. It's possible her situation is similar. My upbringing caused me to feel like I'm constantly on one side of a scale with each person and I always need to keep it level.When you've been raised that way, it can be hard to get out of that bubble and realize not everyone you meet has those expectations. I had the same issue when my in-laws started including me in holiday gift giving before I married my husband, or when they first asked to celebrate my birthday with me. My best advice would be to sit down with her and have a conversation. Maybe take her for coffee and spend some one-on-one time. When you feel comfortable, and when she seems more comfortable with you, explain that you gave her your gift to show that you care about her and that nothing was expected in return. If she seems receptive, then bring up that while you like and appreciate her gift, you don't want her to feel that she owed it to you. Go from there.It took me a while before I was comfortable opening up completely around my in-laws. Now, I'm closer to them than most of my own family. Your care for her will do her lots of good.
jq4p0f,This! I have the same experience. I received gifts if my father did something wrong also. It was a way to buy his love. But they were never just gifts.Also I never knew what people expected me to buy. If they gave me something expensive, I thought that I needed to give them something equally expensive. Gifts were about things someone did or wanted and about money. Even though we weren't poor, but that gift cost so much so you better give me something like that in return. It's hard to explain. But I needed to learn that gifts are just gifts.So I would suggest talking to her. Tell her that you really love the gift she has bought you, but you don't expect something from her. You see her as a daughter and that she is part of the family. Don't expect her to open up easily. It takes time. You can always take her out to coffee or dinner or a day of shopping. And just show her you care for her.I'm sure she is lucky with a person like you in her life.
jq4p0f,Same experience with my ex wife.  Anytime she gave me a gift it was with strings attached.  I gave you this so you owe me.  Also if a gift wasn't in the same realm of price I was showing her up or wasn't trying hard enough.  I still have triggers even after 10 years of divorce. Our oldest son is out of the house and she gives him money occasionally and I shudder to think when he pisses her off, the loyalty she thinks she bought is going to  blow up in his face.
jq4p0f,Whet a shitty upbringing. Your olds can go fuck themselves. I hope you‚Äôve forged a family of your own filled with joy, laughter and generosity.
jq4p0f,My mother in law noticed that I was kind of freaking out whenever she was really generous with me, and she gave me a nice little speech that made me feel better. She said something kind of like "One of the nicest things about being my age is being able to spend more money on whatever you want. I like to be able to give you and my kids nice things, and I have no expectations that you get me anything. It's something I do for you because I love you." It was really sweet and helped calm me down a little.
jq4p0f,One of the nicest things about being my age is being able to spend more money on whatever you want. I like to be able to give you and my kids nice things, and I have no expectations that you get me anything. It's something I do for you because I love you."I feel really lucky to have had people in my life who share this attitude and it's something that I've tried to embody more as I age. I don't give gifts that I can't afford and I try not to offer help or favors unless I'm comfortable with the answer being "yes." I want to be able to give without any expectation other than the recipient appreciating the gesture and telling me when they like the gift. Intentionally making people feel good is a potent drug.edit: added a word
jq4p0f,Wow, what a nice person! You're very lucky!
jq4p0f,This is actually a great way to put it. It‚Äôs really thoughtful of you to want to make sure she is ok and safe. And she sounds really sweet and good hearted for wanting to return a favor.
jq4p0f,This is my favourite. I related to the gf in this case and struggle with accepting gifts as a gift and not feeling that fear of how do I reciprocate and what is expected of me. Starting with the above is a quick comment really. It‚Äôs a no-obligation comment. If she‚Äôs nervous of the mom the idea of meeting for coffee alone would make it a ‚Äúbig thing‚Äù and the anticipation of the time approaching would fill me with anxiety. I wouldn‚Äôt want to go without my partner as a buffer.Start with a statement like this and then act like it‚Äôs not a big deal. Continue on with the evening of whatever it is. Then as time goes on, reinforce this with your actions. If your birthday is coming up set the expectations ‚Äúah when you get my age, you don‚Äôt care about the gifts, I just love seeing everyone.‚Äù Or ‚Äúyou know what I‚Äôd love to do with my birthday this year? Let‚Äôs not worry about gifts but man, a homemade cake would be amazing. I strangely love a good box cake!‚Äù Or something.If you have no daughters, or other young women in your life you could throw a ‚Äúhey. Sorry if I go overtop at times. Please don‚Äôt feel pressure, it‚Äôs just so nice to be able to buy a necklace/feminine thing. It‚Äôs probably more for my own enjoyment than you!‚ÄùI had one bf‚Äôs parent who would do that sort of thing because she could sense we didn‚Äôt have a lot of money. She asked for things like a cooked dinner. She was like ‚ÄúI want to buy all the ingredients but then I just want to relax and not have to cook or clean for one night. That would be amazing!‚Äù
jq4p0f,This is a great way to phrase it.
jq4p0f,Somebody's cutting onions in here.::: hug :::
jq4p0f,I'm saving this for later. Well said and sweet
niaytx,Ok I can see I'm gonna be the outlier here but I'm not sure this is actually about your disability at all, at least at the core of it. I'm reading a lot of things that tell me you are overly dependent on her emotionally.Outside of my family she's the most loving and caring person I know and she's my motivation to do better and improve myself. Honestly, I never thought I could find someone I trusted enough to share my more negative thoughts and problems. I always tried to seem happy so I don't worry others. The emotional support she gives me is really irreplaceable.This can be great but if she's the only person you are sharing your negativity with it can also be a lot, and just because she's a caring person doesn't mean it doesn't affect her. You have said stuff like you don't have your license (why not? Who drove you places before? Does she drive you now?) And that she's the reason you smile (being responsible for someone else's happiness is a huge burden). I suspect that she's already feeling some caregiver fatigue from the emotional stuff and having her mom whisper in her ear that you may someday need physical help as well is just a bridge too far for her. Hypothetically getting arthritis early because you have mild cerebral palsy which manifests as a limp just doesn't sound like a serious deal breaker to me if someone is really into you.I would say that in addition to being proactive about your condition, you need to get a larger support network so she's not your only emotional outlet. If you can't talk to anyone else about your problems, hire a therapist. I also think more independence (getting your license, moving ahead on buying that house, etc) will show that you are and will be capable of handling your own shit when the time comes more than taking her to talk to a specialist or something like that.  Besides my gut feeling is that this particular girl is probably not worth chasing after (not that she's not worth it but that chasing after someone who isn't into it anymore is a losing game). These lifestyle changes will make you much more attractive to the next person that comes along and less desperate to keep them.
niaytx,That‚Äôs what I got out of this, too. OP needs to learn how to be physically independent and emotionally independent. Your partner should never be expected to be your therapist, your happiness or your reason. Do better because you want to do better, not in the hopes that a partner will stay.
niaytx,It's almost never worth chasing someone. If this person wants to leave, no amount of convincing and contorting yourself is going to make that relationship rock solid again. There are plenty of people to love, but if you don't love and respect yourself and your worth first... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI totally agree with your comment. Even beyond the lines you've pointed out, the way OP speaks about her is bordering on problematic. OP, I think therapy is a great idea. You don't have a lot of practice with romantic relationships and I think you owe it to this partner or future partners to practice some of these skills.
niaytx,I had the same thoughts when reading. If she's his main outlet for his emotions and he doesn't know a lot of people, she might be feeling like this is too much for her.Caregiver fatigue is real, and it's a thing, and for such a relatively new relationship, if she's already taking on significant care burdens (whether they be emotional or physical) she might be questioning if she wants to do it for the long-term.That doesn't mean that this isn't fixable, but it also doesn't mean that if OP resolves her concerns that she will stay or even has to stay.The unfortunate reality is that people can be compatible, but not their situations, and this might be one of those cases.
niaytx,This is an excellent perspective. I had a slightly similar situation when I was 18 and my bf at the time was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis. I was prepared to stick around, help him, do whatever he needed. But he was most interested in accepting it as the way things were. The doctor told him he had to be proactive if he didn't want to get worse but he took his diagnosis as his final excuse to be taken care of. Literally wanted us to move states in with his parents so his mom and I could take shifts caring for him.OP sounds more realistic about his situation. As long as he focuses on getting better for himself and improving his life FOR HIMSELF, he'll be okay even if the relationship ends. Frankly though, I think if she can see an effort to improve she'll be relieved and feel more comfortable seeing where the relationship goes.
niaytx,I picked up on that as well. I was a caregiver and it can be emotionally exhausting. She needs support too, and she can't be his sole emotional support.
niaytx,This also stick out to me. She's a girlfriend, not a therapist. She's your partner, not a caretaker.Get a therapistGet a driver licenseParticipate in physical or occupational therapyEssentially, be a strong and independent person. You can also be sensitive and show weakness but you need to be a whole person on your own. This attracts friends and partners.
niaytx,Yes, thank you. I didn't know how to Express this lol. What OP is describing physically vs her and her mom's reactions doesn't seem equal. This feels like an excuse or even a subconscious want to run. Be careful, OP. There are billions of people out there to love of this doesn't work out.
niaytx,Ok I can see I'm gonna be the outlier here but I'm not sure this is actually about your disability at all, at least at the core of it. I'm reading a lot of things that tell me you are overly dependent on her emotionally.On top of that, shes 24, the relationship isnt that old, sometimes 24yo's just want to break up. Add in that the relationship started during covid, which is on its way to being over with which means more opportunities to meet new people.  Im sure the disability contributes to whatever her reasoning is, but even without it, this is an entirely predictable situation.
niaytx,On top of that, she‚Äôs probably also thinking about possible future children, she‚Äôs obviously going to be caring for her kids and trying to feel normal after having them but then also worried about him in a caregiver role, since he doesn‚Äôt drive, she‚Äôs going to have to be driving to dr appointments and maybe be driving herself to the hospital to give birth, otherwise just rely on Uber or something. It will be a lot mentally and emotionally for her.
niaytx,Yeah, that‚Äôs what I noticed too. Super thoughtful comment and better written than I could‚Äôve put it :)
niaytx,This is a good catch. It also reminds me I need to stop glossing over it when people gush about their partners on here. Usually I just skim that part as it‚Äôs rarely relevant
niaytx,nice analysis. I don‚Äôt even need to comment now.üëç
niaytx,Ya dude, your reason for happiness, that's childish teen thinking and I'd never put up with that. She doesnt want to be with you because your super attached to her and that's a huge turn off. Youbhave no confidence or self respect and she can smell it. She probably should break up with you so you can get some life experience and learn to stand on your own two feet.
niaytx,Definitely read this u/jrkong I think this is exactly what's going on
niaytx,Are her fears valid? If these are real possibilities, and she is unwilling to take that on, then there is nothing you can do.If you think her fears are unfounded or unlikely, then maybe sit down with your OT or SW and have them explain prognosis, occupational potential, etc.I also wonder if your negativity might be giving her doubts. If you unload on her a lot, cool it. You might be making her feel like more of a nurse maid than a gf, which may be priming her anxiety about looking after you. If she sees that you are independent and resourceful in having your emotional and physical needs met, then she might be less anxious about it all falling on her. Otherwise you are making it impossible to see your disability as anything but limiting.
niaytx,As someone who is disabled, this is spot on. If her fears are valid, she has every right to not be in a relationship. Hell, she has every right to not be in a relationship anyways. No one owes anyone a relationship. My health has gone downhill significantly in the last year. If my boyfriend broke up with me because it's too much for him to handle, that's completely in his right. Being with someone who is disabled isn't easy, and frankly is too much to deal with for many.
niaytx,I don't know if they're valid and they weren't even things I was worried about. For example, the early arthritis is an issue I wasn't even aware of. This was something she found when looking up the disability.I don't think I unload on her a lot or have been negative. My attitude has always been "if it's something I can do or try then I'm happy to do it" and "if we have a problem let's look for a solution together".I never thought of the possibility where I couldn't walk but that's the scenario that scares her. I just know that my disability isn't progressive so in theory it shouldn't get worse but she's afraid that the side effects like early arthritis is possible and that could take away my ability to walk.What stings the most is it feels like I'm going to lose this relationship to a "what if" and that really hurts.
o4zzmz,Yes, she had three years to "work through this" and she did just fine, simply by ignoring what a terrible thing she was doing. Now it's Bill and Tom's turn to work through it, and it seems like they are doing a good job of acknowledging their responsibility to the child.OP is not "prioritising" her BIL over her niece, it would be important to the niece to keep a consistent relationship with Tom and build a relationship with Bill. OP seems to be smoothing the way, if anything.
o4zzmz,This right here.Why should everyone else have take responsibility and to put in the work, I.e. 'work through this', all due to the choices SHE made!?! Boggles my mind
o4zzmz,Yep, can confirm. 1 year long I was told: ‚ÄûWe can work through this.‚Äú and I kind of tried a few month long. But cause I had to think of it too often, was really depressed and nearly never really happy she eventually decided we won‚Äôt. Maybe that was cause she met someone else‚Ä¶.Anyway what I want to express is: It should be his decision if he wants to work through this and even if he really wants it‚Äôs likely that he won‚Äôt be able to. Also it‚Äôs quite ignorant to imply that the other way (namely breaking up) would be an easy way or something and that he‚Äôs not brave enough to try out the ‚Äûhard‚Äú way. It‚Äôs not. Both ways are fucking hard and at least for me, even after years - I couldn‚Äôt really work through this. Neither with nor without her.
o4zzmz,Damn.So your sister lied to both of these men for years and now expects them and everyone else to bend to her will? It sounds like you, Tom, and Bill have Jane's best interests in mind more your sister or parents do.Kudos to you for doing the right thing.
o4zzmz,Writers of cheap romances couldn't write a character with this level of entitlement even with 10 pens. OPs sister fucked up and has to face the music.
o4zzmz,I'm still surprised anyone is listening to your sister.She married Tom, cheated on him with Bill and became pregnant (unbeknownst to Bill), and then decided Tom was who she wanted to be the father. She doesn't get to decide that ffs. If I were Tom I'd skedaddle too, and the fact that Bill contacted them to stand up and be a father speaks to his character. Maybe it will rub off on your sister.You are a great person OP. You actually seek harmony and what is best for Jane. She is lucky to have you :)
o4zzmz,Are Bill and Tom going to slowly transition father roles so Jane doesn‚Äôt end up with abandonment issues ? Maybe they can slowly pull Tom out of her life if he played a big role and then get Bill in there full time so she can have a bond with him
o4zzmz,I'm not entirely sure there. Tom has been in therapy since finding out but it hasn't made being around her or talking to her easier for him, and his presence has slowly been tapering off. I gave Bill and my mother information for a center that counsels children because they absolutely do need some professional mediation to help Jane through this and with the transition. Tom has been teaching Bill all of Jane's likes, dislikes, favorite shows, characters, stuff like that so Bill can be better prepared.
o4zzmz,Jane is 3 years old. That is actually somewhat good timing for this to happen. Children don't develop any memories until they are roughly 3 years or older. If Bill enters her life as her dad now and Tom gets out of the picture, most likely Jane won't remember much of him and Bill will be the dad she knows best and remembers in her 'childhood'.
o4zzmz,OP, you truly are a stellar human being.If you are not a counselor or mediator, you should probably look into it as an alternative career.  Just amazing how you brought everyone together.Hugs to you.
o4zzmz,As far as I‚Äôm concerned, you‚Äôre doing everything right. Helping out Tom and Bill is a good choice. Good job.
o4zzmz,Anyone else really confused that he called his BIL Tom and the other guy... Bill.
o4zzmz,I totally support your decision. My brother cheated on his wife/ left her for a 19 year old. I supported her after. I wasn't mean to him, he is still my brother, and I understand we all make mistakes. But she is the Aunt to my children. They all know and love her. She had every intention of being married to him forever and was a good wife. She was a great friend and sister in law. She's STILL a great friend. I was recently a bridesmaid (just me and her sister) in her (very small) wedding. My family luckily agreed. My brother made a vow, promised to love her and be loyal. HE brought her into the family and promised it was now hers as well. We all took that seriously.
o4zzmz,What is your relationship with your brother now and the 19 year old? Curious.
o4zzmz,I understand we all make mistakesAh yes, emotionally abusing your wife is just a mistake.
o4zzmz,How is Jane doing in all of this? It must be hard when your dad disappears one day. Is she ok with it?
o4zzmz,Yeah. It‚Äôs not just Bill and Tom who are hurt.  Jane is a victim too.3 people‚Äôs lives have become emotional wrecks due to the actions of one person.  I can‚Äôt  understand why paternity fraud isn‚Äôt a crime.
o4zzmz,Jane from what I'm told is doing good aside from missing her dad. I'm not sure what she is being told about it but after speaking with mom this last time, and talking to Bill, I've given both of them directions to a nearby center that can do counseling for young kids, both in case she needs it and to get better, professional direction in how to explain all of this to her and introduce Bill into her life. If things stay on a good track with my mother I'll wind up swinging by when she has Jane for a day to visit with her.
o4zzmz,Seriously, what is anyone in this situation doing to help the child at the center of all this violent upheaval cope with it? Because it kinda sounds like fuck all because they're too busy bickering.
iyx7ew,"Hey, guys, this year has been unusually rough on everybody's mental health, including mine.  I want to suggest that instead of physical gifts this year we do something special together to celebrate our friendship, like ice skating/spa day/wine tasting/etc [suggest the activity you most would like to do but have a backup just in case].  I can start doing the research now and we can try to plan it for early December?"
iyx7ew,Ooooh this is actually a really nice way to transition out of gift-giving and into spending time! Thank you so much for this suggestion!
iyx7ew,THIS. About 10 years ago, bff and I switched to kinda fancy dinners instead of gifts. We look forward to them so much more since time together is precious with changing family dynamics.
iyx7ew,My girlfriends and I started doing this. We live in NYC and would pick an off-Broadway show or concert and go to a nice dinner together. It‚Äôs now trailed off now that we‚Äôre all married and busier but we still do a nice dinner for special occasions.But if your friend genuinely loves gift-giving, maybe still let her give you a gift and you splurge on a nice dinner/concert/other activity for the two of you.
iyx7ew,Maybe now isn‚Äôt the time to be planning in-person celebrations lol
iyx7ew,This wouldn't work for a friend, but my husband and I often buy art together for big events. When we were poor newlyweds we would buy art from students at an art college and now we have really nice meaningful pieces in our home that remind us of anniversaries and holidays past.
iyx7ew,I think that's such a good idea. OP could give her "experience" gifts instead of physical gifts (if money allows).
iyx7ew,Personally I sound like you're friend - I LOVE giving people gifts and it brings me so much joy than actually receiving a gift (not to say I don't appreciate presents because I do very much no matter how "pale" they seem in comparison)Giving a gift means more to me than just spending money on someone I love and if my friends felt they couldn't "keep up" I would want them to talk to me about it but please keep in mind that she may enjoy the act of gift giving and not be bothered by the kinds of gifts you get her as at the end of the day, you have thought about her! It makes me happy just to know someone has thought about me rather than what the gift actually is.I honestly wouldn't think too hard into it about not getting her gifts of the same level as we are all different! She probably loves you just for thinking about her and getting her something!It would definitely upset me if my friends didn't want to accept anything from me in terms of gifts as it really is the way I process my affection and love for people.Hope it works out for you but communication is key with keeping a good friendship alive! X
iyx7ew,You do sound a lot like her!And that last bit you said about being upset about your friends not wanting to accept your gift is what is really bothering me. I've been a lot more firm with not giving and receiving Christmas presents from other friends and family, and so I feel I need to tell her the same because it's not something that I think I can do. BUT I also don't feel like I could accept Christmas presents from her, knowing that I won't give her one.Do you have any advice for ways I could broach that subject? Because it's not as if I was saying no to ALL presents, just reducing the yearly rate, you know?
iyx7ew,OP, I also LOVE giving gifts. What I‚Äôve found that my friends do now is get me something like a plant and just tie a ribbon around it. It‚Äôs not incredibly thoughtful but I haven‚Äôt had to buy a plant in years, and I love plants! Other things I get from them when they get to the party are things like really fancy snacks they know I love, a fancy bottle of wine or whiskey + a regular bottle for us to enjoy at the party, like regular things that I would have needed for the party but they just upgrade it, and we all consume it together and then I have one for later. I get the joy of throwing the party and they don‚Äôt stress about the gift, and then I also spend less on prepping for the party.I know you said you guys are 20 so the alcohol thing will be for the future, but maybe for her birthday this looks like you go to a bakery and buy her favorite type of cake so she doesn‚Äôt worry about it. Another idea, before the party you say I‚Äôd love to buy you a new top or some fun earrings for your party! Let‚Äôs go shopping, I‚Äôm thinking around $30?
iyx7ew,I was going to say something similar- I would be crushed if my friends told me they don‚Äôt want gifts anymore, it‚Äôs definitely my primary love language. And the top comment mentions ‚Äúthis year has been rough on everyone‚Äôs mental health‚Äù as a reason to forego it, but personally giving my friends gifts has helped me pull through the isolation. Of course if a friend wanted to set a budget or something that‚Äôs one thing, but especially if their reasoning is thinking I don‚Äôt like the gifts they get me when I haven‚Äôt implied that at all, that‚Äôs disappointing. I would talk to her before I‚Äôd ask her to give up something that clearly brings her joy, when the likelihood that you‚Äôre truly an inadequate gift giver is very small.
iyx7ew,Side note: if you do ever need ideas for presents - I just end up googling "present ideas for best friend" and then inspiration pops up!
iyx7ew,I definitely agree with this. I absolutely love giving gifts! To me it's a fun way of figuring out how to show how well I know someone and that I'm thinking of them.I never expect the same level in return because what I end up giving is also a gift for myself. I've been making really fun knitting projects for some people. I in no way expect them to either make me something in return or spend a lot of money to make it feel equivalent. Same goes for how much I spend. If I see something I know they will love, even if its over an agreed upon price (within reason) I get it anyway.I want to see a giant smile on their face and excitement in their eyes when they see whatever it is I gifted them because that's what gives me warmth and happiness, to see them happy.
iyx7ew,I feel the same as you! Gift giving, not the actual material things but the love and care put into making something meaningful and personalised is my love language to family and friends, and it brings me joy
iyx7ew,I also LOVE gift giving and I have friends I get gifts for every year that never get me anything in return. It doesn't bother me one bit because I truly love finding the perfect gifts for my friends and seeing their reactions. They provide their support and that is a gift enough. I feel like I can't always be there for my friends emotionally so finding that perfect gift makes my own short comings not as bad.
iyx7ew,Ha- I wrote almost exactly the same comment!
iyx7ew,This is literally the plot of a Parks and Rec episode. Leslie is super thoughtful and over the top and Ben and Ann can't keep up. Season 5 episode 19. Watch it for some good ideas on how to navigate your situation!
iyx7ew,Hahah I read this post and thought ‚Äúis this being written by Ann, the beautiful tropical fish?‚Äù
o374g6,> Taking time for myself isn't nice when I know I'll just get lectured on how the kids were screaming and it was so hard on him the whole time.Don't give into the guilt trip. I'm sure they scream when you are watching them and it's hard for you too. Such is the life of a parent.You want to go out for drinks? Make a date and go.
o374g6,I fall into the guilt trips really easily because I wonder if I really am pulling my weight. The Drs appointment is because I think I have ADHD and want to get assessed for it. I really struggle with keeping the house organized and clean. I will go to wash the dishes and get side tracked into deep cleaning the kitchen drawers instead, find an old Christmas ornament while tidying the living room which leads to me reorganizing the basement storage, put away the kids laundry and end up rearranging the furniture in his room...forget to turn off the oven a lot which wastes electricity, forget to put the laundry in the dryer, forget where I put important things...it makes me easy to guilt trip
o374g6,You went 5 days without a shower?? And then when you took one, he considered it "me time"? I'm so offended for you üòÖ
o374g6,Right? Every day after his shower she should be like "damn all that me time, you definitely won't need a night out this week."
o374g6,He wasn't even helping when he was on parental leave. https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/m2wmf0/husband_set_up_gaming_computer_in_babys_room/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareThis is your life now. My sister has a similar situation and so did I 10 years before her. We both realized that being a single mom was actually easier. If you're doing all the childcare and housework anyway, may as well not have the added grief of a man that doesn't help and also wants his meals made for him and wants to be c leaned up after. My ex even called it "babysitting" while he cared for our kids when I was at work. I had my me time when they went to daddy's for visitation.Advice from me is to tell him that you two get marriage counseling or he can start cutting child support checks.
o374g6,Her post history breaks my heart. OP was 21 when she got with a 31 year old, did not have any other support, and was already dealing with mental health issues. The 10 year older man started making ultimatums (to just... stop/fix her mental health issues) and OP did not have anywhere else to go. Now she‚Äôs had 2 kids in the last 4 years, the husband has been going through job after job because he continually gets into altercations at work, he has been harassing her to lose weight over and over, and also expecting her to do everything for the kids while he doesn‚Äôt help at all. Oh and yep, he put his gaming setup in the baby‚Äôs room and gamed all day while he was on ‚Äúparental leave‚Äù instead of using his leave to, you know, be a parent and help his wife care for their children? He complains at her about ‚Äúwhat does she do all day when he‚Äôs at work‚Äù if things aren‚Äôt cleaned when he gets home, after she‚Äôs been dealing with a baby and a toddler all day.OP this man sucks. There is a reason why a man like this went for a vulnerable, young woman without other support. So that he could trap and control you and have a wife that doesn‚Äôt fight back against his bullshit because where would you even go? Also preventing you from going out and having any time to yourself/to go see friends, is a pretty efficient way of also preventing you from building or maintaining any support system of people outside the marriage who could help you if you wanted to leave. That‚Äôs how abusers keep their victims trapped.
o374g6,Scrolled down way too far to find someone else who looked at OP‚Äôs posting history. OP, you are in an emotionally (and possibly financially) abusive relationship. If he can‚Äôt make an effort to change then you need to start planning for an exit. You‚Äôre waaaay too young to keep going at this rate.
o374g6,Yup.I read in a "divorce?" thread here once..."How did you know when it was time for a divorce?"At first, it's "I can't do it without you!"Then it's, "ugh, well, this is annoying, but we're a good team."Now it's, "not only can I do it, it would actually be easier to do without you."The moment you realize that your spouse is actually hindering progress of things... You start wondering if it would be easier to accomplish something without their help or without them around... Yup. DONE.
o374g6,One thing I‚Äôm worried about though is with the age gap and his clear anger issues (mentioned in her post history several times) that he will try to harm or kill her. Statistically younger women are more likely to be killed by their older partner + abusive men are more likely to attempt to kill or harm their wives or girlfriends when they try to leave...  and his anger issues worry me, there‚Äôs a lot of red flags here that can lead up to him harming her or their children if she tries to leave. OP needs to first establish a support system with her friends and family.
o374g6,He understands it. He just doesnt care and doesn't want to do more work.
o374g6,Look at the age gap. OP is starting to get a rude awakening as to why a man 10 years older than her ‚Äòchose‚Äô her and baby trapped her. There‚Äôs a reason why these type of men can‚Äôt get women their own age, an older woman wouldn‚Äôt put up with this type of behavior.OP I hope you get the help you need, your husband sounds like an unsupportive POS.
o374g6,He knows full well a doctor appointment isn't "me time".He's being deliberately obtuse in the hope that it's too much trouble to explain to him (argue) that it's not and you just walk away.Start scheduling time away for yourself. When he announces that he's going out with the boys on Friday, be ready with "cool, I'm going out with the girls on Saturday, you'll be fine with the kids".Also, when he gets out of the shower, ask him if he enjoyed his "self care" time. Make the point that if your shower counts as "me time", so does his.Finally, it sounds like he's babysitting or "helping with the kids". The whole mindset needs to change. "You're raising those kids buddy, you're parenting! Either step up or ship out"He's taking the time away to enjoy himself. You don't need permission to do the same. Make plans and see them through.
o374g6,Oh he understands perfectly, he just doesn‚Äôt give a shit about it or you
o374g6,You work 24/7 because "watching his kids for a minute" is not him parenting. You don't get to "come home FROM work." Meeting children's needs all day is work.I am a parent and was a preschool teacher for many years. Being with children is exhausting because their needs are many and constant.  Washing your hair, using the toilet, feeding yourself IS NOT ME TIME.Children need a type of constant physical and emotional availability, planning and execution that takes being 100% on top of everything including everything else that is going on in the home, like maintaining it and doing laundry, cooking, Dr appointments, Dental appointments.....Your husband just thinks you can do it all with your eyes closed and that it's no big deal. He leaves his work at work, and gets to come home and have a change of scenery, a change of pace, some fun with his kids who were taken care of all day by you, so they are probably feeling pretty great when he gets home, if a little hungry because maybe it's dinner time.You need to get out of the house, away from everybody. Get a calendar where he can see it and write in your time. If my husband goes sailing or goes off with friends, I count those hours and demand them in return. At first this pissed him off because it tapped into his own childhood crap of being forced to do more work if "caught" having fun, and he would complain that if he wanted to have fun he had to suffer for it or pay for it, and I had to raise my hand and remind him who would be doing it while he was out.He tried to tell me that I was doing those things anyway, so it was not like I was working harder, but I reminded him that I deserved time away to do fun things too, and I deserved to have someone take up the work for me while I got to choose what I would do with several hours at a time just like he was doing. You deserve it too.
o374g6,That this needs to be explained to a grown adult you are raising children with is beyond frustrating!!!
n73ed6,My ultimate advice is to make a huge thing about it. Next time he brings it up say something like‚ÄúWhy do you think cheating on your spouse is okay? Is there someone you‚Äôd like to tell us Uncle? Is this your way of telling us that you have a secret affair-child that you have hidden away? Or that your current wife actually use to be your mistress?‚ÄùLets see how much he likes it. You and your husband, and your mother apparently, have already tried being civil about this. If he can say it to you, why can‚Äôt you say it to him?
n73ed6,Or that your current wife actually use to be your mistress?FUN FACT: She did.
n73ed6,Not sure why you would think this guy would care.
n73ed6,I think your uncle wants to validate the situation going on between his daughter & the baby daddy. I dont think it really has to do with you & your husband. He just feels like that everyone goes through this dont judge my daughter. And her let me place you two in the same scenario. It's going to turn out that way to. Dont judge my family, kind of thought. Even thought, he probably feels bad truly about the scenario of his family. I think you dont have anything to worry about with your husband. Its a situation that can be tough for everyone, who wants to discuss the scenario. I think its something thst is going to get dragged through thr dirt. I think the situation doesn't need to be given anymore thought. Your cousin's situation happened deal with the outcome and move on. As of right now, your husband had not cheated or had a child out of wedlock, so think of happier things and be there for your family in a supportive way.
n73ed6,What did he say when you asked him WHY he was doing this?
n73ed6,"It's just a question/joke".
n73ed6,Both you and your husband need to put your foot down. Any time your uncle brings this up say something like "Wow, [uncle], what is wrong with you?" And then leave the conversation. You don't have to completely cut ties, but you do need to give him the message that everything stops when he brings this up and that he only gets to talk to you if he's being appropriate.
n73ed6,Yes, this. ‚ÄúJesus, you need to stop being so rude.‚Äù Or if he says he‚Äôs only joking: ‚Äúnobody is finding this funny - just pathetic.‚Äù
n73ed6,Has your husband tried the old 'play dumb' trick where everything that comes out of your uncle's mouth is something he doesn't understand and needs explanations on?It's like when someone tells you an unfunny racist 'joke' and you keep asking them to explain it because you don't get it, when you're actually just letting them lengthen the rope they're hanging themselves with.
n73ed6,You could also try to turn it back on him and say he seems to have alot of knowledge about this situation so is he talking from his own personal experience? Then I would ask him loudly in front of the whole family how his secret/real/side family is doing and how many kids he now has
n73ed6,List time! OP needs all the ammo she can get."Are you saying that you think my husband should cheat on me?"
n73ed6,YES. And immediately make it homoerotic somehow. Fragile dudes like this cannoottttt take any implication they may *gasp* find other men hot.BUT GUESS WHAT - he thinks your husband is a fox and you should point that out. "Wow your crush is really obvious." "So you think about my husband having sex  a lot, huh?" "Why are you so invested in another man's sex life...?"
n73ed6,but if the rope gets too long they won‚Äôt get hung
n73ed6,God i love that trick. I once pretended to never have heard of "The Simpsons". It was great. Even better, because the coworker that was explaining it to me was someone i had talked about the Simpsons with like a month before.
n73ed6,Gah, your uncle sounds horrible.  Passing off an insult as a joke is still an insult, just without repercussions. It's great that your husband does not give your uncle any room but the fact that your uncle has now enlisted his kin in this thinking is a line too far.  Kindness hasn't worked.  Firm denials haven't worked.  Time to get ugly.  If your uncle denies access to your grandparents, then your mom/dad need to step in.  What your uncle is saying and doing is not okay.
mumlol,I used to be the exact opposite of your girlfriend. I used to vent a lot to my then boyfriend and he seemed eager and open enough to give me time and empathise/sympathise with me and assured me i wasn't a burden even though at times i did used to think that i was and let him know that he could tell me when I'm getting a bit overboard. Later when things got bad between us (different reason), he admitted that i had been a burden on him all along. Crushed me to bits and I'd probably won't ever do it again with anyone.I get where she's coming from, and she's not completely wrong. I think you should try to be as open as possible to her BUT also suggest her some therapy.Edit: not exactly opposite
mumlol,My girlfriend read your comment and said this is what she fears regarding me‚Äîshe wouldn‚Äôt want me to do that, and I never will. I want her to flourish. I‚Äôm so sorry that you had go through that. I can‚Äôt imagine how it must feel for someone to say that during bad moments, and I can see how that prevents you from opening up again. How are you doing now?
mumlol,I was the guy in this situation once. I didn't want her to feel like she couldn't come to me, but I also wasn't equipped to deal with two sets of burdens at the time. I still feel shitty about my lack of communication and emotional maturity.
mumlol,This was me with my ex. I even told him to let me know if he needed space or was at capacity. Most of our time together wasn't even spent with me venting. But then when stuff started going downhill he told me I was a burden and it was my fault for feeling the way I did. I don't talk to anyone anymore about my feelings and even though it's made my depression much worse and I'm more distant from people now, they like me more.
mumlol,My first boyfriend wanted me to share my anxieties with him. I saw a therapist and only talked about my anxiety in therapy because I didn‚Äôt believe it was his burden to carry. But he always told me he would be there for me. Then he dumped me without so much as a word that we were having problems. A year later he said he dumped me because of my anxiety and that it made him anxious to date someone like me. That is the kind of shit that really fucks a person up.
mumlol,jesus christ why are you MEthis was me with my last boyfriend.I was trying so hard to keep things to myself, but he was really hurt when i wasn't, so I finally let go, and then later on....UGH.Even when you communicate, even when you do the things you're supposed to do in a healthy relationship, it doesn't matter if you're doing it alone.
mumlol,The same thing happened to me...with my current boyfriend. It crushed me and I have withheld a great deal from him since. We are starting therapy soon to try to get over this bump.
mumlol,Same thing happened with me and my boyfriend. Not sure what to do from here. I got a therapist but my insurance ran out so ... now i feel like i have no one to talk to.
mumlol,Wow, I‚Äôm currently the guy in this situation. When things are bad she vents at me most of the day. She‚Äôs done therapy here and there in the past but refuses to go now because ‚Äúthey will just say the same thing‚Äù.It got to a point where I felt like I was carrying the stress of two people (the other being my own stress). And because she was burdened I didn‚Äôt want to share my burden so as to add to the stress - it did come out at points here and there and she couldn‚Äôt deal with it - so I withheld everything. It‚Äôs really affected the relationship but I don‚Äôt know what to do...
mumlol,Very similar situation with me and my bf (and looking at the comments this isn‚Äôt unusual). I used to keep most stuff to myself, especially that which was difficult or hurt me because I didn‚Äôt want to burden my bf - who repeatedly insisted he wanted me to let him in, he wanted to be there for me and understand me etc. Then when we had a rough patch and some of our worst fights he threw it back at me that I was emotional, couldn‚Äôt handle life or myself etc. It really hurt and for a long time I avoided opening up at all and always put on a fake smile for him. He regretted his behaviour and we‚Äôre getting back to a better place now but I definitely still have those moments of doubt where my instinct is to keep it to myself.
mumlol,I highly recommend therapy- I find that when I'm in therapy, and have a safe space to vent, then I can talk about these issues with my partner before/after talking to the therapist in a less heavy manner. So it's more like, problem solving together or discussing rather than emotional dumping (which I save for my therapist) and I don't feel like I'm placing the emotional burden on my partner. It usually makes me feel like I have better tools to discuss these things, and make progress outside of talking with my therapist because all the extreme emotions have been dealt with, and I have a different perspective of how to approach them.I sincerely hope this helps!
mumlol,t hurts because I‚Äôm there for her all the time andwanther to use me and talk to me, she‚Äôs the person I care about most in this world, but when she goes elsewhere I feel entirely useless. How can I help her in general with her feelings and how can we change this mindset together? Any help is appreciated. Thank you so much for reading.I agree. I have a therapist and it's very helpful for sorting out the pressures and feelings in my mind. The first try may not work out, it may take several tries. If she starts to enjoy venting to the therapist instead of you, don't take it personally. At the end of the day the reason for the therapist would be to calm down her feelings of self-consciousness and if that works, it's not reflecting anything negative of you.
mumlol,This is what therapy is for! Honestly, it's great that she trusts that she can vent to you, but mental health is like any other health. She would talk to you if she has the flu, but she needs to go to a doctor to get medical support. She can vent to you about problems, but therapists are trained to support people through issues beyond a partner's level.I used to be a therapist and would often get friends/family venting to me about problems. I would listen and help with what little I could, but the whole point of a therapist is someone who doesn't know you, is trained in listening and asking the correct questions, and is non-judgmental. They are not your friend and they don't tell you only what you want to hear - they are a professional, and often the conversations and experiences you have with a client are ones that could only occur within the safe space of a therapeutic bond.Don't feel useless - feel pleased that you and your gf have such a great relationship that you want to help each other so much.edit: I was having the opposite problem with my dad recently - my mum passed away last year, and I've had discussions with him that would have been far more appropriate for a counselling session. I told him repeatedly that he should get some therapy, but unfortunately the waiting list was massive. I listened as a daughter and as someone who loves him, but I felt unable to challenge some of the things he said - he's my dad, after all! He is doing much better now, but a grief therapist would have been exponentially better.
mumlol,Also, it's important that venting is not the same thing as sharing your problems and asking for support! Venting is more like when you just word-vomit all over somebody, generally without looking for any productive conclusion or checking in with the listener first (to make sure they're in a space to receive it). It's not healthy to vent to anybody a lot. But as your partner, it's still important that she communicates about the things in her life that are ailing her. I would highlight this distinction in your conversation with her!
mumlol,I would just say that you shouldn‚Äôt be everything to each other and it‚Äôs ok for her to have other people she relies on and talks to.
mumlol,I have said the same to her before, she‚Äôs more than welcome to vent to anyone else; the issue lies with the fact that throughout the whole day, I was asking many times if she‚Äôs okay, what‚Äôs wrong, what‚Äôs on her mind, etc, and the entire day I got dead responses or her just saying she‚Äôs fine, she promises, and then she went and vented to someone else straight away without them even asking when I was there asking the whole time.
ktohyr,Support your grandmother in her move. Refuse to acknowledge him. You‚Äôre entitled to feel how you feel
ktohyr,I agree, but also if you do have the financial resources available you could find a person who would be willing to come and do the things your dad can‚Äôt when they get too much for her until her move. If your grandma is involved in a church, or even if not, there might be people who would volunteer to do those things as well.
ktohyr,As hard as this all is I think a community will do wonders for her just in socializing again. As soon as you stop being active in older ages everything catches up quick. For her health, joy and piece of mind this could be a great thing. And who knows she might be using his lack of checking in too as the reason to really push her to make the decisions even if she could still make it work. Hope it all works out.. she and you sound like great people!
ktohyr,OP, I understand that you're angry, but it sounds like she is making a good choice for her future. Even if he were a doting son, assisted living might be the right choice in the longer run. Living alone as an elderly person is pretty dangerous.And it's very possible that has no regrets. That she would make the same choices all over again, with her head held high.It's totally ok to be angry with your sperm donor, but I'd suggest making sure that in the process you're not making your grandma's decision any more painful.
ktohyr,I def agree with that first part. My grandmother stayed in her home much longer because we hired someone to be there every day, but it ended up still being worse for her in the long run. She didn't get all the medical care and assistance she needed.
ktohyr,Yes. These are her choices as a grown woman with agency. Don‚Äôt let your father live rent free in your head via your anger.
ktohyr,I fully agree with this.Also, I just wanted to give you (and your mom) props for you going to college, and not allowing this man to drag you down with him. I've seen many times where the child wants to be in the toxic parent's life so bad, the other parent allows it, and then the child turns out exactly like the toxic parent, if not worse.Staying away from that man was/is the most healthy thing, so good job to both of you.There are extremely toxic people on my kid's dad's side of the family. I've done a good job of keeping them away from my kids so far, but pretty soon they will be legal adults, and I'm terrified of what could happen. I can only hope they will be smart and strong enough to resist being dragged into their drug addicted hell.
ktohyr,100% agree. Bio father sounds like a real loser but maintaining an entire home as an elderly person is a challenge even with help. I‚Äôm sure your grandmother is sad about leaving her home, but it‚Äôs likely for the best.
ktohyr,Yeah, and she might just want a change in addition to everything listed here
ktohyr,Assisted living is not a good option right now because of covid‚ÄîI write this as an EMT who has been working in hotspots since spring of last year. Assisted living facilities and NHs are death traps rn: if there are alternatives that can be explored, especially since your grandmother is healthy and active, I would help her do so or be a point of contact for people who are local and would like to get involved.
ktohyr,My grandma called us all one day about 5 years ago and said she‚Äôs selling her car and house and moving to a retirement home.My mom and aunt lived in her neighborhood and were always over there helping and would always come if she needed something. She said she just felt like it was too hard and she was tired of cooking for one and cleaning up all that space.She loves where she lives now. They have a dinning room the residents go down to and sit together and the staff comes and takes their order (they have three options for each meal and a weekly menu is given to them). She has a small ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù (super small fridge, sink, counter) so she can still make her own coffee and toast. They have a housekeeping staff that comes once a week and cleans the bathroom, vacuums the whole apartment, and washes the bedding (she has to wash her own clothes, but has the option to pay a little more for them to do that too). Plus she gets to go various events they have and spend time with other residents on a regular basis.Since COVID, it‚Äôs been a little harder. We can‚Äôt go visit at all, except my mom who is her medical caretaker. The dinning room has been rearranged to make sure everyone is 6ft apart, which makes conversation a little hard when most of them can‚Äôt hear well. But she is still happy there and doesn‚Äôt have any regrets.
ktohyr,This is a best case scenario for your grandma. Taking care of an elderly family member is hard for people who have their shit together. I don't think you really want to trust your grandma's wellbeing to your father in particular. Assisted living will provide your grandmother not only with the help she may need in a medical emergency, but also with the companionship of the other people living there. My great-grandfather lived about 10 years after my great grandmother died and the first couple of years he was miserable. When he medically couldn't live on his own anymore, be agreed to go live in assisted living. It was exactly what he needed. All of a sudden, he didn't just have his daughter as his only friend, he had dozens of friends his age and things to do. I know it can seem like he's abandoning her because it's what he did to you and there's pattern recognition there, but if seeing her isn't an obligation, they may both enjoy their time together more.
ktohyr,My grandpas place was awesome for that. It wasn‚Äôt super super high end but it actually felt more like a hotel than an assisted living facility. They had coffee and donuts everymorning(that had the acidity taken out..it was really good coffee), movie nights, bingo, wii, a dining room that had menus and felt like a hotel, and you got a little thing of ice cream at every meal if you wanted. Shoot, it even had a barber shop and hair salon.
ktohyr,I think your grandma is making an excellent choice for herself. Even if he all of a sudden stepped up, there is always a risk of him dropping off again. So it is probably the safest decision for her. What if her mind goes and he starts stealing her money? She's is protecting herself. And I think you should support that. And I agree that your bio dad is a piece of shit, don't talk to him about it.
ktohyr,I think she is making a good decision too for the long run. There are factors I did not think about and the more I sit on it, it does seem like the best decision. I just want her happy and healthy
ktohyr,I think its important to mention here that your anger isn't serving you. I have dealt with intense anger before, and I know I might not reach you here. You will be happier if you start taking steps to let go of his actions.Your biological father's presence in your life is larger than it needs to be, and your feelings are keeping him there with you. Don't let him hurt you further, and let go of what you want him to be and live your own life separate from him.
ktohyr,I hate wasting my time and emotions being upset because of him. And I know anger will get me no where. I don‚Äôt know how to let go even though I know I need to.
ktohyr,I can‚Äôt even begin to tell you how much this resonates for me. This is such important advice.
ktohyr,In ordinary times assisted living is usually the right choice, but during the Covid crisis you should encourage her to stay in her own home for as long as she can possibly manage. She can use the equity in her house to pay for the help she needs with yard work and errands, and you can step up , take responsibility to call her daily to check up on her, and then make arrangements for outside as necessary. Seriously, she should stay at home until she gets a vaccination at very least. Residential health care and assisted living facilities are Covid hotbeds with very high fatality rates.
ibv7wz,I had similar issues with my mum and previous boyfriends. After years of her siding with guys who were emotionally abusive to both her and me, I eventually told her she had to choose. Either break up with the guy or I would estrange myself from her. She broke up with him and things got better after that.Not saying you should do something so extreme, but continuing to accept this guy's behaviour will not improve the situation.
ibv7wz,Thats not always the response you will get. My mother chose her boyfriend over 2 of her kids. So i cut off all contact with her.  And then said boyfriend almost killed her in a fight gone wrong and she apologized. Life sucks too often.
ibv7wz,I did the same thing, but it went the opposite direction. My stepdad was physically abusive to my mom, and mostly verbally/psychologically abusive to myself and my two step sisters (his bio kids). It started when I was about 8, and when I was 15 or 16, he and I got into our one and only physical fight. I left after that and moved in with my (at the time) bfs family. My mom said she was going to leave, but ended up forgiving him. I was estranged from her for about 2 years after that, but I eventually forgave them both. Truth be told, I just missed my mom.Fast forward to when I was about 26. I lived 1,000 miles away and my mom called me from a women's shelter. They'd gotten into another bad physical fight, and she swore she was leaving. For the last few years, she'd call me every time they fought bad. It was very stressful because she was suffering but wouldn't take concrete steps to end it. I was afraid he was going to kill her. I offered to help her move the 1,000 miles down to my place and I was elated when she accepted...and heartbroken again when she went back. I told her that I had to cut off all communication for my own mental health unless she actually left for good. I didn't talk to her for a few years...until I forgave them both again. I just missed my mom.She finally got away from him when he put a bullet in his brain in 2017. I thank the cosmos every day that he didn't take her with him. She still mourns.I'm so sorry that you are going through this. It's a hell I don't wish on anyone. It's heartbreaking and mentally taxing. I don't have any advice, because there was nothing I could do to stop the abuse. I guess all you can do is speak your mind to your mom, try to be as supportive as you can until you can't anymore, try to take care of yourself and maybe consider therapy if needed. As the saying goes, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.
ibv7wz,OP this is the best advice. My mom always chose the men in her life over me. She's still dating a guy that kissed me. She let her friends keep touching me even though I asked her to make them stop.Get out now because you don't want to find out who your mom will pick if this guy ever tries to touch you.
ibv7wz,I am so sorry you went through that. I do not understand what in the world possesses some moms to accept abuse directed to them and their kids.
ibv7wz,This is what my DH had to do with his dad. He stuck with his abuser for several years but then he eventually kicked her out.
ibv7wz,I'm sorry. I have no advice. My mother is also in a relationship with an abusive man. I have told my mother how I feel. I am very low contact with my mom because of him. This may sound bad, but at this point, I'm waiting for him to die first. She won't divorce him. It's sad but she is a grown woman who has the made the choice to stay with this abusive person.
ibv7wz,I‚Äôm in the same situation. He was my abuser and she didn‚Äôt leave him, even after I went to the police about it. Police didn‚Äôt do anything except interview him, but i guess spanking a 15 year old‚Äôs bare ass so hard i couldn‚Äôt sit for a week for not doing the dishes isn‚Äôt abuse to them...Fuck him. I can‚Äôt wait for him to die. I hope it‚Äôs sooner than later. I want my mom back.
ibv7wz,My mother is still with my abusive father, and we've never openly talked about it until I snapped at her one day when she was hounding me on why I missed my dad's birthday so I talked about the abuse with her even saying she go the worst of it.Cue 2 hours later I get a gaslight txt about how that never happened and kids see things differently and how they gave me just love.Worst part is my father has openly acknowledged to me what a shit parent he was and is doing amazing with my son.They just get wrapped up in their own narrative
ibv7wz,Great advice. OP is under no obligation to tolerate this abusive treatment. Her mum is a grownup who can make her own decisions, but placing yourself in the line of fire doesn‚Äôt help anyone.
ibv7wz,Your mother is a fully grown adult and you can‚Äôt help her if she doesn‚Äôt want to be helped. All you can really do is say you‚Äôll be there for her when she decides to leave, and you‚Äôll only see her without him from now on. If she brings him anyway, you just leave.Has he always been like this? If it‚Äôs new he was either hiding it well or he has some sort of physical issue like a brain tumour or chemical imbalance.
ibv7wz,I believe that something like dementia can also cause angry outbursts like this. If this is new behaviour, a visit to the doctor is probably a good thing.Regardless, I agree, OP should continue to support their mom, but not the relationship. Just remind your mother that this isn‚Äôt normal or acceptable behaviour. How would she feel if YOU were in a relationship like that?
ibv7wz,Dead right just leave them.I'd avoid their negative energy. Continue to see your mother but not with that toxic man she chooses to be with
ibv7wz,I was in your position for almost ten years. My mother married an alcoholic who would verbally abuse and humiliate her every. Single. Time we came over. My birthday with my family - ruined. Thanksgiving - ruined. Everything was about him and you never knew when it was coming but you knew it would. The hardest part was seeing my mother, who had always been my role model, tolerate and allow herself to be treated like that. I couldn't watch it any longer. I didn't tell her that I was making her choose between us because I have always found the choice after an ultimatum to be disingenuous.  I told her that I could only choose for myself and for myself... I could never be around him again. I was removing myself from the situation.  If she wanted to stay with him she would have to come to terms on how difficult it would be to schedule time together and that holidays would never be all of us again. She made the decision to leave him and I have never been prouder or her. I had to help her with a place to stay and money to help her transition but it was well worth it for her to find her value once more.I am sorry you're in this situation. Its a very hard place to be. I hope you and your mother find the strength to do what you need to do to be happy.
ibv7wz,My Dad had and has been verbally abusive towards my Mum. I stood up to him and call him out on his ridiculous behaviour."I believe you are ridiculous one; throwing a temper like a God damn child without reason which is why everyone is staring at YOU. If you can't calmly express yourself, leave the restaurant to prevent further embarrassment to yourself. We'll find our own way home."Be cautious though, as I'm not sure if your step father is being physically abusive too. Regardless your Mum needs therapy to see that this isn't normal male behaviour.This is what makes my blood boil.
ibv7wz,If this happens again (in a public place around other people), pull your phone out and start recording him.You can also ask your mom what kind of advice she would give you if your boyfriend was screaming at you in public.
n68mt9,Don‚Äôt spring the announcement on them in front of him, even if they know he exists. Have dinner with them alone, and let them know you‚Äôre serious enough with your new boyfriend that you‚Äôd like them to meet him. Mention some concrete, good l qualities and how he makes you feel.  Gauge their reaction, but it‚Äôll hopefully lead into a nice dinner meeting.Edit- I‚Äôd recommend a restaurant so anyone can make a graceful exit, and there‚Äôs an organic time limit.
n68mt9,I like this response because it focuses the OP's efforts on the new introduction and ignores the overstepping with her previous partner. I feel like that will sort itself out. My mom kept in touch with my first boyfriend for too long, and it fizzled out eventually.
n68mt9,I <3 things with organic time limits
n68mt9,I learned some good advice from an advice columnist which might help. When you are sharing news that someone else may not like [and they are not impacted at all but just may not approve], don't approach them with, "Now don't be upset, but..." Instead, act "happy and stupid," meaning pretend that the other person has no reason not to be happy for you too. It prevents them from immediately getting defensive and reactive, and instead frames any negative reaction as a non-sequitor to your happiness and almost irrational. Compare:"Mom, I know you really liked Ex, but I met someone new." Her focus is on Ex and comparing the two."Mom, I met someone and I am so happy." The focus is on you being happy.[Edited to clarify that the advice is in a situation where the person receiving the news is not impacted at all by it so that no one else gives the "this is a gaslighting abusive tactic" warning]
n68mt9,This is also good advice towards kids who tend to react poorly in exciting circumstances! Literally a tool for moving forward without them pre emptively getting overwhelmed. Funny how it applies to adults too!
n68mt9,I really like this idea and it makes a lot of sense! I really do hope the fam embrace the new partner, OP deserves to be happy.
n68mt9,I second this! Sometimes it's worth acting like you don't have the awareness to understand the nuances of an awkward social situation
n68mt9,This is how I go through life. It works, can confirm.
n68mt9,Even in writing that advice is so powerful. You can feel it!
n68mt9,Sounds like you might need to prepare yourself to set boundaries.I agree with others that you should tell them without your bf being there. If they try to bring up your ex that‚Äôs when you set the boundary. They‚Äôre adults, give it to them straight. ‚ÄúI understand you liked him, but it‚Äôs been a year and that relationship is over. It makes me feel uncomfortable and like I can‚Äôt share my relationship status with you when you keep bringing him up. I‚Äôd like you to meet my boyfriend currently but I need you to be as over my ex as I am before that happens.‚Äù Or something like that.
n68mt9,Have a frank conversation with them about it and let them know your concerns. It's natural to want your family to like your partner, but it's more important that you like your current partner. Your family should be more invested in your happiness and your current relationship than they are loyal to one of your exes. It's their job to be happy because you're happy. Their opinions and preferences are immaterial.
n68mt9,Need to set the boundary that your relationships are for YOUR life happiness, not THEIRS.They need to be respectful and realize that you are happy with this new bf and you & ex broke up for a reason. They dont have the authority to make that decision. They can make suggestions but it is your life and your decision.
n68mt9,I mean of course it is. But you brought someone into their lives that they grew attached to. Now you're taking it away through no fault of their own.  I could see why they're miffed.
n68mt9,I went through something similar after a breakup. When I told my dad it was over the first thing he did was ask if they could still he friends and told me to tell him he still wanted to come help him fix his sliding glass door. It was clear he thought/hoped we would get back together.Telling him I was dating someone else was tough but you just have to rip off the bandaid and do it. Make it clear it‚Äôs not up for debate and politeness is a requirement moving forward. It DEFINITELY took my dad awhile to warm up to my now husband while he and my ex had been super buddy buddy from the get go. But now they‚Äôre very close and definitely see each other as family. It may take a little time and awkwardness but unless your parents are totally unreasonable it‚Äôll get better.
n68mt9,My mom adored my ex and swore up and down that we were supposed to be together and questioned if my now fianc√© is ‚Äúthe right guy for me‚Äù.She worked with my ex for about 5 years, so they became good friends. I think my ex is a good guy, but just because he‚Äôs a good guy doesn‚Äôt mean my mom couldn‚Äôt have been happy for me.It‚Äôs your love life, not your parents‚Äô. They‚Äôll get over it in time just like how my mom did. Pretty sure my mother in law had similar feelings too. I would hear about his ex often and how she basically raised her and was surprised they broke up yada yada. Really weird moments where she meant no harm. People just get close with people regardless and that‚Äôs ok. But making other people uncomfortable and not knowing boundaries isn‚Äôt. Just let them know how you feel.
n68mt9,This actually makes sense. OP is fully responsible and entitled to meet the kind of guy she wants to meet. And that her parents cannot dictate or control that.But it's just that, OPs parents are humans just the same and must've made connection with her ex. They may feel that OP breaking up with the ex is like them, losing a friend. It hurts them just as much.The issue of course is when they start projecting and hoping that they'd be together again.
n68mt9,I don't think it's acceptable or really healthy for parents to be so involved in their grown up children's relationships. OP it's not like you're in your early 20s. You are truly a grown up.It just doesn't make any sense for them to anoint themselves a more qualified judge of the situation than the couple themselves. It's unfair to cast their judgment unto you like that. The relationship is about the 2 involved. Not about the parents. "But we liked him.." is purely their subjective sentiment that has nothing to do with how the 2 felt about the relationship.If you are on good terms with your ex is it possible that he help explain to your mom that you guys have broken up and it's for the best for both parties? (if he agrees with that sentiment) That is definitely outside of typical expectations though so he shouldn't feel obligated to get involved in any way.Otherwise, just shut your mom down. Don't care so much about what she thinks about your new BF. I don't think it's really all that necessary to speak about your own relationship with your parents until it's serious enough to discuss marriage. Let her sulk. Let her pout. Don't reward such childishness with attention.
i1tbez,You do not need to be ruthless, just be consistent.  ‚ÄúThis is not working out for me, I need to stop seeing you.  I wish you the best‚Äù.  Then leave, and go no contact.
i1tbez,I agree, and no contact is ABSOLUTELY what's needed!
i1tbez,. ‚ÄúThis is not working out for me, I need to stop seeing you. I wish you the best"  And repeat.
i1tbez,Exactly... I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs normalized to hate each other after a breakup. When all it comes down to is, we are not a good match.Also. It‚Äôs not fair for OP to stay with this person bc he‚Äôs scared to be alone.
i1tbez,Do it in a public place. Don't do it at her place. If op wants to do it at his place, make sure his family or friends are around.
i1tbez,Take that dive. Don't waste your youth trying to change someone else. Be brave. Go find yourself, then maybe someone else. Jerk off for a while. Take up a hobby. Watch a movie she hated. Life goes on, don't let it go on in misery. For both of you. If you grow to resent her, it'll all explode later.
i1tbez,This! Do it and move on don't spend another month or year or even more in a relationship you aren't happy in, in the end you'll regret all the lost time you could be single and work on yourself or maybe find someone right for you.
i1tbez,I needed this. It's hard to leave someone you have a history with, a rough one at that. But yeah, I needed to hear this
i1tbez,The first time is always the hardest. It may seem like you'll never recover, but with time you will learn to love your independence.
i1tbez,it‚Äôs important to learn how to be strong and confident to make difficult decisions in your life. everyone deserves to be happy and one should never be in a relationship just to make someone else happy.It‚Äôs called building character and something positive always comes from it. You got this! :)
i1tbez,Love your positivity. Keep encouraging people to be themselves. Have a wonderful day.
i1tbez,There's a girl (hell, plenty of girls)  out there that won't have any of that negative bullshit. Go find one and be happy.  You'll look back at this relationship and say to yourself,  "what the hlll was i thinking? "
i1tbez,Okay, so let me get this straight... She's now 21, you are now 18, correct? You have been on a relationship for 14 months, meaning: You were 17 and she was 20 when the relationship started, right?This may not seen like a large thing to many, but, it is, and I don't know how I'm the only one seeing it!This age difference doesn't mean much when you're over 25, but it means a hell of a lot right now.No 20 year old young woman looks at a 17 year old young man (honestly, BOY is the right word to use for a 20 y.o. train of thought) and thinks, "I want to be in a relationship with that kid." That's the first red flag here.I personally don't know of any single 20 y.o. who's family wouldn't react negatively or give all the side eye to them if they were to bring an underage person home as a date! That's the second red flag. Do NOT let these people be any factor in you leaving! They've assisted in her behavior by encouraging the relationship in the first place.The third red flag bis her being great and then starting to treat you like a toy, being a bit better once you demand it, then falling back into a pattern and blaming you for it... This is called a CYCLE OF ABUSE!She is grooming you to the abuse, she's been doing it since the beginning. Women CAN be predators, too! This isn't exclusive to only men being the abuser and aggressor. This relationship has BEEN abuse from the start. You were underage and she took advantage of you, made you comfortable and then started using you as she truly sees you. When people show you who they are, believe them!Here is the good thing: you are obviously a very intelligent person and are aware of the damage she is doing to you and have called it out and are seeking escape from it!The not so good thing: you are being abused and statistically, an abuse survivor generally tries to leave 7 times before they are successful in breaking free.You SHOULD, most certainly, leave the relationship! Then please get some therapy for you to have the proper tools to navigate your healing process so that you don't hold on to the abusive behaviors or the reactions to them. The last thing you want is for you to become a victim again or to adapt into the abuser.
i1tbez,Immediately recognised that and don‚Äôt think many others have noticed it. Could not fathom how I‚Äôd even meet a teenager when I was 20 let alone pursue them. Or even want to.
i1tbez,Some people throw around the word abuse waaaaay tooo easily. They are 3 years apart. Yes it‚Äôs at a fairly crucial age, but not anything worth blinking at. Besides this, OP hasn‚Äôt even said anything remotely ‚Äúabusive‚Äù. ‚ÄúTreated like a toy‚Äù can be as simple as taking him for granted. Besides this, when OP has brought it up his GF has admitted as much and tried to change (not very effectively, but that‚Äôs FAR away from what abusers typically do which is to deny there is even an issue to begin with).Understand that patterns of behaviour can be difficult to change. That doesn‚Äôt mean OP has to put up with it.... but that jumping to: you are abusive because when we first met you were great and now I kind of feel like you take me for granted and don‚Äôt care about my feelings anymore... well that‚Äôs how a FUCK TONNE of relationships develop over time. Because it takes work to maintain a healthy relationship and the initial hormone jumping phase (which OP may not of had so much but his GF likely did) meant it didn‚Äôt really take ‚Äúeffort‚Äù to maintain a good/supportive space.I mean, it‚Äôs called the honeymoon PHASE for a reason. Let‚Äôs not turn typical relationship milestones into abuse cycles. The fact is (and this might sound cynical) people want what they can‚Äôt have and once they know they have it typically get complacent. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fair, doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be happy with it or stick it out, but don‚Äôt accuse the other person of being abusive just because they got lazy.Anyway, OP is young and if he was never totally into this he‚Äôs certainly not obligated to stay. Sounds like he may need to ‚Äúsow his oats‚Äù so to speak anyway given how young he is.
i1tbez,THIS! THIS! THIS! I think OP being a guy is maybe one of the reasons people are willing to look past what is most definitely grooming. It sucks, but there is 100% a double standard when it comes to recognizing that a child (which OP was when the relationship started) is being preyed upon. Break up with her ASAP, & go no-contact as soon as possible. Wishing you nothing but luck!
i1tbez,20 and 17 is not weird
i1tbez,Why are Americans so obsessed with therapy? This absolutely does not require therapy. It‚Äôs literally just a guy who wants to break up with his girlfriend.
lk3bta,Just make sure he does not have full information: date, time, place. And that no one who does will give him the information. Less he knows, the less damage he can do.No more discussion about any details with him.
lk3bta,This is good advice. A friend arrived at her expensive restaurant party to find the color scheme and flowers completely changed because the manager thought a controlling and kooky acquaintance had permission to do so!
lk3bta,Also make sure the venue has a list of people allowed to make changes, presumably you, Fianc√©, and if there are any family/friends etc helping you organise things, so if he does find out, they don't allow him to change things without your say so.
lk3bta,He knows nothing else other than the colors I was going to choose before we fully decided on a courthouse wedding.
lk3bta,Maybe tell him that due to Covid you are thinking of postponing, appreciate his offer of assistance and will let him know if you need anything.Naturally, you won‚Äôt need anything, so you won‚Äôt be updating him. And since you were only thinking of postponing no harm done when you don‚Äôt.Just don‚Äôt talk about the wedding in front of him.
lk3bta,Nah fuck it. Give him the wrong date and place. Later on just say "oh, we decided on a different time and place."
lk3bta,You can find some inner peace, and keep walking away from conversations you don't want to be a part of.You can keep saying No to Jack, but you already know that won't work.Jack is either a bully who thinks he can weasel his way into something by making himself unpleasant enough, or he just isn't playing with a full deck. Either way, you don't have to play along with a bully or an idiot. There is no contract and there will not be. You've told him he doesn't have a florist job. Sounds like you've told him in earshot of others. You're golden. You just keep on walking away.
lk3bta,Thank you for this.
lk3bta,Dont tell anything else about the wedding to anyoneAsk others to not tell him anything about the wedding eitherTalk to your vendors and make sure no one but you and your fiancee are allowed to change stuff, also make sure to set passwords with them(that means that you need to give then the password to change anything. It's to prevent others from changing things without your consent)Make sure you do that last one to the florist, explain  them the situation and ask to report to you if a guy calls in trying to cancel their servicesKeep walking awayIf you want, you could try talking to the person in charge of both of you and ask them to talk to Jack to back offCheck with your HR if it's possible to just make a report but ask them to not take action yet(HRs can do that apparently but ask to make sure). This way they'll be aware of the situation and will only interfere if it escalates or you ask them to. This could protect you if Jack tries to report you for excluding him or something elseGood luck
lk3bta,Going to HR could put OP on  notice as much as Jack. They are there to serve the company‚Äôs interest, not yours. Bringing things to them could blow back on both Jack and OP
lk3bta,Yeah just never talk to jack about your wedding ever again. Change the topic, don't even invite him. Avoid him. Seriously that's so weird of himIve had similar experience. I've invited coworker A, and there are other coworkers (from my dept) invited. But she still wanted to bring coworker B as a plus one (I didn't invite B because she's not from my dept and I have no budget to invite the entire Co).B is great at baking. So somehow A just told B she should bake for my wedding. Without asking me. And B got excited too. I had no budget to pay B and of course I don't want her to bake for my wedding for free.Due to other reasons A dropped out of the guestlist. Thankfully.
lk3bta,Well as I‚Äôve said we‚Äôre doing courthouse with my best friend and her husband as our witnesses. We don‚Äôt want a huge event because our family is high risk and also we both hate crowds.
lk3bta,So what happened with B?
lk3bta,Just treat it as him being weird (because wow he is), while still saying firmly no every time."Wow, I can't believe you're still hung up on my wedding, just drop it already", and then change subject to something work related. You can say it in a "haha you're such a funny guy" voice so it doesn't sound as aggressive, but the script isName the behaviour: still talking about your weddingName the change you want: just drop itChange subject so it's harder for him to keep discussing it (and also so he has a way to save face by engaging in a work appropriate subject of he so chooses)Any more discussion about it will just give him a chance to argue his point and you don't want that, because you clearly can't reason with him.
lk3bta,Tell him the wedding is canceled due to COVID, and maybe next year.
lk3bta,Is he invited to the wedding? If not I would honestly just ignore him when he starts his ramble.
jiwh65,Have you told her you're now filing for divorce? Have you hired an attorney?Don't allow her to manipulate the situation. She made her wants of meeting others clear. Those feelings won't go away. Do what you have to do for your own piece of mind.
jiwh65,I haven't told her yet.i have told my parents and I will give myself two weeks to make preparations: getting an own bank account, writing lists what accounts I need the passwords to change and what companies take money from the account, set up rules for the time we live in the house together and talk to a lawyer. Now that I have seen how far I have been in the rabbit hole I see that I need to make a swift and firm cut and I have to be ready for that.
jiwh65,My ex wife had some narcissistic tendencies and tried some manipulative stuff during the divorce process that I did not expect given how relatively nonhostile things ended (she ended it unexpectedly, and while it was pretty devastating, there wasn't a major blow up or fight). Lawyer up, and let that be an insulating barrier between you and her. The legal system has handled this situation before and there are precedents that you probably won't be aware of without a lawyer that could screw you over (or help you a lot) in the long run. Do not try to navigate this by yourself, especially if she has a history of manipulation.My ex would take a mile if you gave her an inch, so personally I found it to my benefit to avoid being generous out of any sense of past affection when negotiating. Be as selfish as you can comfortably be and know that compromise will move things towards fairness (instead of in her favor). YMMV. Good luck!
jiwh65,If she acts on the feelings and cheats can't you win all your stuff in court? because she wasn't faithful. I'd worry with her being a narc she will try to take you for everything you have and it will get messy if you leave especially if she's about to end up rejected by them when they go back to where they're from. I know it's probably hard but the worst possible case should be prepared for, I worked at a bank and I saw too many people end up pennyless because of a divorce
jiwh65,OP. Google grey rock technique for keeping your sanity during this trying time when you deal with her.
jiwh65,I already read about it. it will be definitely helpful!
jiwh65,What are other good strategies when dealing with a narcissist?
jiwh65,she has feelings for them she wants to act them out. And if its not okay for me, I can end the relationship. Its up to my choice.That does sound like something a narcissist would say to put this on you. SHE made the choice by putting her time and effort into some online game and random dudes instead of your marriage.I've been divorced for one year after leaving a narcissist that had an affair with my "friend" for a year. I'm now in the happiest place I've been in my life. Divorce is tough, but I promise there is light at the end of the tunnel.
jiwh65,Thank you!
jiwh65,Why would you even entertain the idea of letting her stay in your flat if she's going to go visit some random video game guys and maybe act out feelings she may or may not have?  She's stringing you along because your the safe option in her back pocket. You want to be that safe option for her?  Cut her loose and divorce.  You deserve much much better. Hit the gym and delete all social media. Also check the bank accounts.
jiwh65,I am talking about 1-2 months. We own a ton of shit together. Afaik the laws in my country don't allow me to kick her out if we are married. I need to talk to a lawyer about that.
jiwh65,True. With COVID do you want to live with someone who is dating around?
jiwh65,Hope you are doing good now!
jiwh65,It's absolutely insane the damage caused by people who blurt out shit like this.  My exwife said I might have aspbergers because I was antisocial from a chronic illness.  Of course it's only coming out now that she has major issues and working through them on therapy, but holy fuck, letting thoughts like that ruminate in your mind for MONTHS does some incredible damage
jiwh65,Getting out from under a narc is HARD. She is trying now because, though she still wants what she wants -- the other guys ... whatever, she is at risk of losing. Narcs hate to lose. You are a supply. Attention. Validation. Supply.CBT ma dude. Even if you can't get into a therapist, get the book Mind Over Mood. It will help anchor you so that you can reclaim your reality. Because a narc loves to fuck with your reality with the projecting, guilt trips, pity parties and gaslighting, some or all of which you may have encountered. CBT helps you frame your mind to reorient your feels.I am sorry you are going through this.
jiwh65,Better write out those abbreviations. CBT just as well may mean cock and ball torture and not what OP needs. Though you never know.
jiwh65,What's CBT? Yeah, the gaslighting is rough to realize! Thanks!
jiwh65,Cat Butt Tits? I dunno how that's supposed to help, but interesting suggestion nonetheless...
hmbenr,Being upset over being invited and then not invited is pretty understandable. So is being upset over him not going and then suddenly going.So no, you are not insane. As for gender issues, I don't think they plan orgy or something and I can understand only close friends thing. I was only woman in otherwise guys trips and husband knew about it. But, all my friends also accepted partners unless it was work trip (he just dis not wanted to go)And I fully understand why you would be uncomfortable with the whole thing too, especially the way it was communicated.
hmbenr,I feel like if my friend invited their significant other, I wouldn‚Äôt then tell him to un-invite her. Even if I wanted it to be just close friends, I think it sets a precedent for how these friends may be ok treating his girlfriend. I‚Äôve definitely met girls who try to stake claims on platonic male friends and are unnecessarily unwelcoming to the male friend‚Äôs girlfriends, I‚Äôve even had it happen to me with my own fianc√© and one of his female friends. I would look into how these girls treat OP to specify that she is not allowed to come, after she was already invited.
hmbenr,I think it‚Äôs ok for dude to go but the girls friend has to meet the friends and be comfortable with them.
hmbenr,I can understand OP feeling upset boyfriend said she could come (maybe assumed without asking?) and then it turned out not to be the case. Or they changed their mind?But I'm honestly confused as to what is wrong with OP's boyfriend hanging out with a group of several woman? Does someone want to explain? What are people worried is going to happen on a trip of 1 guy annd 4 girls that wouldn't happen in a more evenly mixed group of 2 guys and 3 girls?I understand not liking the one-one girl/guy trip because that seems date like. But what are 4 woman going to do with him? Have a big sexy pillow fight in their underwear? If you are afraid he will break off from the group and try to hook up with one of the girls, then he could do that in a mixed gender group?It just feels sort of . . . sexist? Like what would a man be doing with woman? They can't be real friends, must be some big sexy scheme for them to want him there.
hmbenr,It‚Äôs really weird to me that he said he‚Äôd only go if you went, they said it was him or not one, and then he said he‚Äôd go by himself. Is he being sketch? Are the girls? It‚Äôs just... all parts of that are weird!
hmbenr,Also it went from seven women to four, SO invited and then not invited, that makes it feel like a bamboozle is afoot. How upsetting would it be if the next statement is, none of the other women ended up making it so it was just me and (woman I have the relationship with). If he couldn‚Äôt/wouldn‚Äôt bow out when he realized SO couldn‚Äôt go, I wonder if he has the backbone/desire to back out if none of the other women show (or just one woman who is actually a wingman that will give their privacy while providing the appearance of it not being an intimate trip).It‚Äôs not the trip or friendship with a woman that is a problem, it‚Äôs the boyfriend not demonstrating to the girlfriend that he has the savviness or backbone required to navigate the potential pitfalls of these situations. This is my view if I am assuming he has no intentions to use the appearance of a group trip as a cover for cheating.
hmbenr,Yes. I am seeing red flags.
hmbenr,It's not really about it being all women... and then your boyfriend. Some SOs would be fine with this and some would not. It's a boundaries thing that each couple needs to figure out between themselves.I thought it was a solid move on his part to invite you to go (though, he should have asked them first). When they said you couldn't, I think he should have bowed out. I would have a problem with this too.But all you can do is tell him how you feel and what you are comfortable with. If his values don't match up, this isn't the right relationship for you. And that's why you date people - to find this stuff out.ETA per your edit/update: this makes it worse OP.however i was always very worried about the girl hosting as bf was always talking about her / to her on the phone/ going for walks together and bought her a rather expensive birthday gift after sort of jokingly telling me he wouldn‚Äôt spend as much money on me. when i met her she was a bit stand offish
hmbenr,I think there are a lot of issues at play here.Why doesn't OP feel like she can express her feelings to her SO openly? Why can't she say "I don't want you to go?" Would he not respect that? If so, there's the answer - they're incompatible. Also, why doesn't OP have more information about who these women are or what they're planning on doing?
hmbenr,Soooo much worse. Maybe it's just me but I have more self respect than to allow myself to be treated that way
hmbenr,With your edit it seems like the friend is trying to get some alone time with him under the guise of a girls trip. He‚Äôs letting you know where you stand in his life. Don‚Äôt try to be the ‚Äúcool‚Äù girlfriend and push aside your feelings.
hmbenr,Agree. I wouldn‚Äôt care if my SO wants to go on a friend‚Äôs trip, but to be specifically uninvited because the friends don‚Äôt want you there? That‚Äôs awkward.At the very least, he should have checked before inviting her. He put his girlfriend in a really uncomfortable position.
hmbenr,Personally I would not go on a trip with people who made it clear my partner was not welcome. You're right to be suspicious when they specifically exclude you after your boyfriend invited you. There are a lot of possibilities for why they are doing this, but none of the reasons can be good. At the very least they are being disrespectful to you and if I was your partner I wouldn't go based on that principle alone. I also think that if your boyfriend chooses to go on this trip with these people who have told him that his girlfriend is not welcome then it says a lot about his boundaries and how he values his relationship with you.
hmbenr,Eh I mean sometimes you want to hang out with friends without any partners involved. It changes the dynamics of things and some things such as sleeping arrangements can be more difficult.I wouldn't put it in the disrespectful bucket seeing as OP doesn't know these friends very well
hmbenr,Damn, they just want to have a get together with people they know well, they don't know OP well. What's with this scaremongering?I'd be pissed if I had a disgruntled GF insist on coming every time I tried to hang out with a buddy. It sounds like they just don't like OP very much or don't know know her well.
kgb5i0,Leave and let him work out this tantrum on his own. Come back only when he agrees to treat you with respect. He HIT you. He PUSHED you. That is physical abuse. It is NOT okay. You do not have to stay and be his emotional punching bag until he feels like stopping. In a few days when he has calmed down, tell him in no uncertain terms that you will not tolerate that kind of treatment and if it happens again, even once, you're gone. Personally, I wouldn't agree to return until he agrees to go to therapy.
kgb5i0,Good advice, thank you!
kgb5i0,I agree with this apart from telling him if it happens again you‚Äôre gone. I would keep that to myself, not actually tell him and if it happens again go.
kgb5i0,Depending on where you live leaving the house can be a starting point for who gets to stay in the house.  Talk to lawyer before threatening to leave.
kgb5i0,"He's yelling at me nonstop and forcefully pushes me out of the way when I'm standing in his way. I tried to comfort him and gently touched his arm but he slapped my hand away."It's time to pack a bag and go visit someone for a bit. If he is angry, you are not his emotional or physical punching bag. This is not normal, and you should not have to deal, endure or cope with it. It's a car, it can be replaced. He is placing the value of his car over you. That is not ok. Big red flag.
kgb5i0,My husband is a man who loves his cars- they are his hobby, his passion and his first love.And I‚Äôm telling you right now that if he pushed me after one of them got wrecked, he would be wrecked.This is not ok. Being upset, irritated more than usual, mourning- sure. Taking it out on you, PUSHING you? NO.He needs counseling. He is unable to deal in health with big emotion. What if something more serious or upsetting comes up (and it will... that‚Äôs life). He needs to learn to handle disappointment and anger without using you as a punching bag.
kgb5i0,You are less than one year into this marriage and he is already being abusive when life doesn't go his way. There are a thousand other things that can go wrong in a marriage. Is this an indicator of how he will handle them? The hard thing to realize is that if you do nothing, it won't get better. You will end up remembering this as the FIRST time he was abusive.You really can't sweep this under the rug. All the red flags are flying. Find someplace safe to stay and don't go back until he apologizes. And not an "I'm sorry, but..." apology. He doesn't get to blame the situation or you for his behavior. You obviously know this isn't OK because you are here posting. You are right. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. While you are taking a break, read up on the early warning signs of abuse and do some serious thinking about whether there are other things that you have missed or excused. Take your time and don't go back until you feel safe.
kgb5i0,If it‚Äôs that way with a car think about if it‚Äôs something bigger than that happens.
kgb5i0,Or if he learns that he can treat OP this way with no consequences, it will take less and less for him to lash out. Can't find the remote? Throw a glass. No milk in the fridge? Throw OP against it.Once a pattern is established, it becomes more difficult for OP to see & leave, because she's already dug herself in to excusing his behavior and seeing his abuse as somehow her fault because she couldn't calm him or help him.
kgb5i0,For example, what would happen if your future teenager accidentally crashes your husband's favourite car?
kgb5i0,Pack a bag and leave. He physically abused you, on your own home. And the yelling is also not acceptable. 11 months. Not even a year in and he thinks he can pull this. To hell with that.
kgb5i0,Your husband is physically and verbally abusing you. You are in danger. Right now your priority is being safe, not being victim and rehabilitator for your abuser.Call family or friends and let them know what is going on. Have safe family or friends either move in with you or move in with them, and take everything you can't live without especially identity documents like your birth certificate, social security number, and passport. It may be safest to do this while he's out of the house. Get in touch with a divorce lawyer to make sure you aren't doing anything to endanger what you're entitled to in your marriage (e.g. leaving your home may be construed as abandonment and could cause you to lose it). Talking to a divorce lawyer doesn't mean you have to get divorced, it's just to cover your ass, okay? Do NOT tell your husband anything about your plans to talk to a divorce lawyer or move out/move anyone in until you already have and you're safe. This is the most dangerous time and if he thinks you're going to leave he could escalate dangerously and/or do things to fuck you over like drain bank accounts.Do not worry about your marriage until you are safe. I don't believe in forgiving abuse like this but I'm not going to tell you how to live your life, I'm just going to say there's nothing stopping you guys from staying married if he's not a total monster and decides to get therapy, go into anger management, or snaps out of it when he realizes his behavior is so unacceptable it's scared you off, and then you can choose to re-cohabitate and resume things.If you have pets, get them safe too. Abusers often abuse pets or use them as leverage to get their victims back. You need to act as though he may do the worst or the unthinkable because you can undo removing pets from his care, you can't undo them being killed or abused. Don't worry about protecting his feelings. He is not worrying about protecting yours.This is a put on your own oxygen mask before helping someone else with theirs situation.
kgb5i0,My boyfriend gets very stressed at work sometimes, especially during this pandemic. Know what he doesn't do? Push or slap me away. Despite being at his wits end, he'll calmly tell me to leave him be for a few minutes while he processes X problem. I'll give him physical space, and if I accidentally get in his away passing him in the hallway or whatever, he does NOT slap me away, he'll remove himself, not me.I'm worried fir you. Please find somewhere to go for the time being.
kgb5i0,Even this sounds like he's on the edge.Maybe he was a very angry dude who learned mitigation strategies?Please don't let this escalate.Emotionally healthy adults who are neuro-chemically balanced don't get angry to the point of having to isolate themselves completely to avoid hurting others.
kgb5i0,It‚Äôs not okay that he pushes you. He needs to learn some coping mechanisms.
kgb5i0,I want to add that it is extremely easy to seriously injure or even kill someone by pushing them. If they lose their footing they can fall and hit their head and if they land poorly even break their neck. Trauma to the head can result in anything from a mild concussion to death.
kgb5i0,forcefully pushes me out of the way when I'm standing in his way.This is not OK. Or slapping your hand. Now if you're standing in his way to block him from leaving, etc., that's shitty too (blocking/preventing someone from leaving is abusive), but the way you wrote this, I can't tell if that's the case. But he should not put his hands on you for any reason.This happened to my dad about 10 years ago. Someone hit his car in front of his house and totaled it (the neighbor called my dad and was like, "Did you hear that noise? Go look outside, someone just trashed your car and drove away."). It sucked because after paying insurance premiums for like 40 years, they told him if he didn't have the name of the person who hit the car, there was nothing they could do for him. It's not fair, and it's shitty, but ... shit happens. That's life. If he can't deal with troubles without lashing out at you, he needs to get therapy. It should be non-negotiable. I also agree with walking away when he gets like this. He doesn't get to use you as a punching bag, verbally or literally.
kgb5i0,First of all, you're not responsible for making your husband deal with his feelings like a grownup. Second... this is not normal. This is so, so not normal. One or two instances of temper would be one thing - everyone has bad days sometimes - but your husband is "yelling nonstop" (which he almost certainly knows is extremely upsetting to you!) and escalating to physical assault (!) over something that you weren't even responsible for. Behavior like this is a MAJOR red flag. Please, leave as soon as you safely can.
k3hgmp,8F's violent behaviour is stressing me out really bad and I wish I didn't have to babysit her, but I promised my mom I would do it.What?  You promised to babysit.  Not to manage a child that needs inpatient care.  You should feel fine saying this isn't what you signed up for and that you can't do this anymore.You should NOT do this anymore.
k3hgmp,I‚Äôm with this. That is not normal 8yo behaviour by a long shot. She needs a full eval and some kind of treatment plan weather or not she get a diagnosis for her behaviour she needs therapy and coping skills. I‚Äôve been around a lot of 8yo and hitting and name calling isn‚Äôt great but that can be bad behaviour. The biting and 4 hour tantrums are not age appropriate behaviours.
k3hgmp,Your half sister needs help, a kind of help you cannot provide.If your mom can afford a baby sitter and won't do anything to prevent you from being hit, then she will have to pay for a babysitter.You are under no obligation to put yourself and your child in danger. What if she hurts your baby? You are already too stressed and honestly, your baby comes first. It's going to be a hard conversation but you have to tell your mom.Your mom and his partner are enablers and if they really love their child they should have her talk to a therapist.
k3hgmp,Sounds like she can also afford therapy for the child
k3hgmp,Um she shouldn‚Äôt be forcing that on a babysitter either.
k3hgmp,What is your mother and father's childcare plan for once you give birth and are not able to babysit anymore?
k3hgmp,I was wondering that too. They will at least temporarily have to find an alternative, so why not make the alternative the permanently solution.OP I'm so sorry you are having to experience this on top of being pregnant and on top of a pandemic. I think you did the best you could and no one should fault you for wanting to back out, despite the previous arrangement made. Please discuss this with your mother and let her know that your half sister's behaviors have crossed many boundaries and that you simply cannot continue for the sake of your health, your unborn baby's health - both physical and mental.Also, as others have said, your half sister could benefit from therapy.
k3hgmp,Yeah this. What if something happens to your own child because of this? Do they expect you to bring your newborn around an 8 year old that hits, bites and screams??!Get out of this situation now. Your mum isn't offering an alternative because she doesn't have to. This works for her. But those children are not your responsibility. Please take care of yourself and your baby first and foremost. Listen to your husband.
k3hgmp,My thoughts exactly. I'm a parent and I know full well a new mom is not going to be in a position to be taking care of a new baby + these two other kids. There's a lot of life changes and a steep learning curve when you have your first kid. OP if your mom thinks you will be able to physically manage that + your sisters you need to tell her to put the crack pipe down.
k3hgmp,Yes, I hope OP isn‚Äôt planning to babysit with her newborn. She shouldn‚Äôt say there isn‚Äôt an option there‚Äôs always an option
k3hgmp,Omg that child needs SERIOUS mental help. This is nowhere near normal for a child to do - especially an 8 year old.This is not your problem. You NEED to stop babysitting. Either your mom changes her schedule around or her husband does or one of them quits. I personally would have quit the first say your half sister laid her hands on you.
k3hgmp,I was waiting for this comment. Perhaps there‚Äôs an unknown diagnosis on the spectrum, or perhaps the child has experienced some trauma. Could just be being raised not knowing the word ‚Äòno,‚Äô who knows. But she needs evaluated. As a nurse who worked with a violent child in home care- please remove yourself from the situation before you are hurt. Also, I doubt very highly a professional sitter will stick around long with the above described behavior either.
k3hgmp,Yeah, this child really, really needs help. Screaming, hitting and biting on a daily basis, at age 8? OP, your parents are in denial about how bad it is. Tell them you will stop babysitting unless they get her to see a child psychologist and a developmental pediatrician as soon as possible. You promised you would babysit; you did not promise you would get assaulted every day. Even if you weren‚Äôt pregnant this would not be acceptable. Your half-sister has serious problems.
k3hgmp,You aren't a bad daughter or person if you break a promise. This is something serious.Your responsibility lies with your baby and your husband.Your mother's responsibilities lie with her two daughters and her husband.Do you wonder why they won't get a professional babysitter? I bet you it's not cause of the pandemic. I believe it's because they know they would quit asap if they were bitten or hit. Still that shouldn't fall on your shoulders. Seriously ask yourself this:What's going to happen after you give birth? Are you rushing over there straight from the hospital with the baby?What's to stop your sister from potentially harming/killing the baby?How can you rest up and put the baby down for a nap with a constantly screaming child in the next room?How can you go to the bathroom but leave your baby in their bouncer or bassinet with 8F roaming around unsupervised? Bring the baby into the bathroom with you?What if you need a C-section and must stay home and rest?What if you're holding your baby trying to warm it's bottle and your sister bites your arm that's holding the baby?There's too much at stake here. Please listen to your husband and just say no. I don't know what kind of situation you havw with your mother or if you feel responsible cause she stuck around and raised you but you are not obligated to "pay her back." She did what she was supposed to do, she birthed you but does not own you.Rest well and good luck with your baby.
k3hgmp,This!!! Not only is this an unsafe situation now, but your baby will not be safe around your half-sister once they are born.Your half-sister needs serious help, and you need to stay away from your mom‚Äôs younger daughters to protect yourself and your family.
k3hgmp,Lots of good points, but I do want to gently point out that if you're watching a baby on your own, there's definitely gonna be some times you bring the baby into the bathroom with you. I have a 14 month old so I speak from over a year of experience on this one ;)
k3hgmp,I'm no expert but a child hurting adults (a vulnerable pregnant person at that) and insulting you is really, really, really serious stuff. Does your mom know that this is happening?I know pandemic makes any job more important, but so is your life and the life of your child. You're not helping your mother through a pregnancy; you're putting your life & your child's potentially at risk too. I don't know your family dynamics... but I do not think it's fair to put you in danger first when other options are available.
k3hgmp,no, you absolutely DO NOT have to help them. you‚Äôre PREGNANT and your mom doesn‚Äôt care her awful child is ASSAULTING YOU. What kind of parent is that.
k3hgmp,You have full power to just walk away from this situation. "No, I cannot babysit anymore because I will not let myself be subject to your child's violent behaviour." You are the only one keeping yourself in this situation.
lmwytt,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt keep making a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it.‚ÄùThis quote helped me a lot.
lmwytt,So true! At a certain point I realized it was the sunk cost fallacy, but I just kept hoping I could make it work if I tried harder.
lmwytt,I was you a few years ago - probably anxiously-attached to someone who was avoidant. We broke up, and I took a year to work on myself. I made myself a "single girl checklist" of things I wanted to do prior to getting into another relationship (things like travelling by myself, getting a tattoo, going skydiving, living by myself). It sounds crazy, but it really helped me come to terms with myself as a person, and my own bad habits (ex and I were together for 4.5 years, and I learned that I need to see all sides of things, and work on being more independent). After that year, I waded into the dating pool, and discovered online dating (which was AWFUL in itself - do not recommend lol). However I kept my identity, focused on the present instead of what I wanted from the future, and stopped giving free passes to people with shitty behavior, and also stopped giving more than I was getting. It took a lot of hard work, a lot of tears, alot of wine, and the help of my very best friends, but I did it. I got out, and I learned how to be strong individual. These days I am in a much happier relationship, and my mental health and sanity are much much better. Hang on. Distract yourself with a bucket list, and you will get through it.
lmwytt,The bucket list is a fantastic idea! Some things will be harder to put into practice during the pandemic (at least in my area), but there are definitely some small goals I'd like to set for myself and try to achieve at home.  Maybe I'll finally finish writing the album I've been trying to write for years.I know by the end of the relationship that I was totally codependent and will need to work on strategies to deactivate my anxiety before I am ready to start dating again.  Right now I can't even stand the idea of entering anew relationship any time soon, haha.  But I will be taking the time to work on myself!Thank you.
lmwytt,same! I see so much of myself in OP and you. was in a relationship for 2.5 years where I struggled so much to get him to communicate in a way that worked for me, that just didn‚Äôt work for him. it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault, and everyone can make mistakes in a relationship, but it comes to a point when you just gotta face the facts if you‚Äôre ultimately incompatible.OP, definitely take a solid chunk of time for yourself. for me it was months of crying and sort of drifting along in daily life, but I feel worlds better now. the truth is you just have to distract yourself just long enough that it becomes a subconscious habit. you‚Äôll still think about the breakup/relationship sometimes, just less and less. I‚Äôm sure it sucks to have this come to a head during a pandemic, but try to lean on your friends and really focus on you. move your body, do something creative, overall just keep your mind doing things besides going over and over the breakup in your head! sending love to you. you‚Äôll get through this sooner than you think!
lmwytt,I love the idea of a bucket list.... i think i am going to try this too! Thank you!
lmwytt,It's cliche but time does heal- and you've done so much growing and you've gotten so much better at recognizing things within others and yourself that you can continue to do so moving forward, to your own benefit. That growth will help you heal too. I used to beat myself up all the time for sinking years into an ex that I truly wanted to marry... but we were never going to be compatible after some of the things that were said and done. Now I'm in my 30s and I've been married for 8 years to someone so different from my ex and completely wonderful for me. I never saw myself marrying after that breakup, but here we are and it's shocking how much happier I am and how much better he treats me. Hindsight really is 20/20. If I'm honest, that breakup (and the months following) were some of the most painful moments of my whole life. It sucks bad. But if you focus on the reason you broke up, what you want and deserve from life, you'll get better and better and one day it won't hurt as much, and then another day it won't hurt at all. I'm sorry you're hurting, OP- but I'm proud of you for doing it. There's no shame in taking longer than you'd have liked to figure something out- and the stuff you learned in the meantime will help you immensely in the future. Good luck!
lmwytt,This comment was like a virtual hug.  Thank you so much.  I feel so seen, and I teared up reading it haha.I'll keep reminding myself that what I want from a partnership and from myself were not achievable in that relationship.  It sucks that love was not enough, but I am proud of myself for walking away too.I'm so glad to hear you found a fulfilling love :) My ex told me recently that all relationships have problems and that the grass isn't always greener...but I like to think I can find a relationship with problems I am more able to handle.
lmwytt,I‚Äôm going to tell you what people keep telling me: you are defending him too much. The things you have described, even if we assume you are presenting a biased account, are not things a nice or good person would do to someone they loved.It‚Äôs still second nature for me to defend my asshole so I understand where you‚Äôre coming from. But a good partner wouldn‚Äôt snip away at you until you were so raw that tears became an automatic and conditioned reaction. ‚ù§Ô∏è
lmwytt,I really appreciate this comment.I have heard that sometimes couples therapists are bad at pointing out when one person is clearly the problem in the relationship, and I worry a bit that this has happened here. It doesn't sound like they are both good people who just want different things of life--it sounds like he is an incredibly selfish asshole who will make the next person he dates just as miserable, and she is not fundamentally a selfish asshole.I could be completely alone on this, but I am also a bit skeptical of the whole "attachment style" thing. I once had a boyfriend accuse me of having an "avoidant" attachment style. And with him, I was avoidant, because he gave me no space. The next person I dated found that idea completely ridiculous, and thinks I am always affectionate and available.OP, for what it's worth, I think you should date a few more people before you decide that you are permanently "anxiously attached". I think anyone dating your ex and getting as little emotional support (including when your father had just been diagnosed with cancer, WTF) would end up acting "anxiously attached." It's like accusing someone of having a problematic appetite when you're not feeding them enough, and they're just constantly hungry.The way you phrased it, and I suspect your couples' therapist phrased it, you both have "attachment disorders". I would perhaps reconsider--I think there is a very reasonable chance that he is just an asshole, and there is nothing wrong with you.
lmwytt,Haaaahaha. My mom says the same thing.  And I think it's true.  I love him and want to protect him from judgment as this is definitely a biased post.  But you're right - I need to stop downplaying my emotional pain and his role in it.
lmwytt,I can see myself so clearly in this post. I was in a relationship for 4 years that had communication problems too.Except I was the dismissive avoidant. These last three years after the breakup, along with its new semi-relationships I had, made me reflect a lot about it. I had serious communications problems, commitment issues. I think I'm doing a bit better, still not sure I'm 100% ready for a relationship but I'm starting to yearn for this kind of connection.Anyway, one thing I can say for sure: I wouldn't realize how bad of a boyfriend I was without the breakup. It was shitty, but it was necessary for me to feel how serious that was.You did the right thing. You do deserve someone that prioritizes you. Hopefully this breakup makes him realizes his issues and you two can grow (apart)
lmwytt,Thank you so much for your response and for sharing your experience.  I feel for my now ex, as I really do realize that he never meant to hurt me.He did tell me today that he's scheduled an appointment with a therapist, which I'm really happy about.  I hope it helps him sort out his emotional needs, among other things (he's been having trouble staying focused on work/chores lately as well).  I wish the best for him.Breaking up with him was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, and I guess it's yet to be seen whether or not I cave and crawl back to him.  I'm feeling alright for now, though, and will keep reminding myself that I need to take care of my needs first.
lmwytt,I appreciate your input, but I think a better thing to do would be to normalise men getting therapy rather than normalising the idea that women need to be hurt to be part of a man‚Äôs redemption arc. I see this too often, it‚Äôs the crux of the often-cited in this sub ‚ÄòShe Divorced Me Because I Left The Dishes By The Sink‚Äô where a woman pleads with her partner to not treat her like a maid/manager for years, until she breaks up with him and he realises he had been treating her like a maid/manager.
lmwytt,I have to ask, why were you like this with your ex? How did you feel about them as a person? To be blunt, it doesn't seem like OP's ex gave a damn about her, and I've always wondered what this kind of relationship was like from the avoidant's perspective.
lmwytt,It is so hard to be in a bad relationship like this, where you carry all the weight on your shoulders and the person who's supposed to be your partner just... doesn't help in any way. You think that if only you put in a little bit more effort, your partner will do so too and the relationship will become healthier. But it won't.If you find yourself in a situation like this in the future, keep in mind that the appropriate response to someone not putting in any effort is not giving more and working harder yourself. You'll be setting yourself up for failure because the SO will see that they don't even have to try and you'll still be there, accepting all their shit. It's not healthy for you and you deserve better.The bad moments were bad, but the good moments felt like a relief so you stay... right? If this sounds familiar, look up intermittent reinforcement. If someone is occasionally sweet but is then distant or neglects you, it literally has an addictive effect. You probably don't miss him, but the idealized version of him. The version you got to see every now and then, but less and less often. This is probably why you let it get this far and didn't leave. It literally creates a response in your brain that makes it so hard to leave and so, so tempting to just keep trying.Maybe also look up codependency. It sounds like you have the tendency to help others at your own expense or to try to fix things that you can't fix.Take it from someone who is currently going through the same thing. Don't look back now. You have given it your all, and it still wasn't enough. Love alone is not enough to make a relationship work, unfortunately. Your future is not with this guy, but I am sure that in time you'll see that that's a really good thing.
lmwytt,I'm not the OP but I really value this advice. I'm going through it too and will really try to take your words to heart.
nut6ss,This is normal and healthy. And you‚Äôll continue to grow and expand your mind as you get older.This is my advice to you:Learn boundaries. Toxic people try to steamroll your boundaries. You‚Äôll actually have a better relationship with them once you respect yourself enough to stand up for yourself.Water your relationships. One of the people I got closest to during the pandemic is my best friend. Who lives across the country from me and I haven‚Äôt physically seen in 3 years. But we took the time to text, zoom, watch movies together. Closeness isn‚Äôt necessarily connected to physical distance. It‚Äôs about the effort you put into maintaining that relationship.This time in your life is when you‚Äôre going to really start deciding and understanding who you are and what the world is. Your understanding of your family and how and who they are will change multiple times as you go through new experiences and understand on an empathetic level what they‚Äôve gone through. This doesn‚Äôt mean you accept toxic behavior. But it does help you decide how you want to react in different situations and relationships because you‚Äôve seen where certain paths have taken your family.Be as involved in your new life as possible. Build a community. Find friends. This will help with the pain and homesickness.You are not losing your family. They are still there. You‚Äôll just need to be more thoughtful on how you spend time with them.Good luck to you on your journey!Edit: thank you for all the awards, you lovely people!Edit 2 misspelling
nut6ss,Thank you so much for your input, it was very thoughtful. I like how you said to be more involved with the new life. Focusing on the future is much better than dwelling on the past.
nut6ss,This is terrific advice. Thank you.
nut6ss,This is advice that every young adult starting their journey in life should be given.
nut6ss,This was great advice.
nut6ss,Yes, this. never leave family, completely behind, if you love them. Just hold your hand up, as it were, to the toxic. and engage with the love. Family usually end up yeaning for one another especially later in life. Meter the contact if needed, but keep the channels open, phone, chat,, zoom whatever. We all move around these days. I live in Oregon, have close cousins in Texas, up & down the west coast. Family in medicine, pro sports, loggers, and so on. some wonderful some not so much. But in some ways all keepers. By the way I am old. Really.
nut6ss,Toxic is toxic, wether family or not. If it's better for your mental health to keep a distance, then do so.I have dealt with this. Personally I felt I was able to maintain a decent relationship with my immediate family once I stopped living with them because I was able to control when, and what I dealt with from them. I keep most conversation cordial and light, I avoid sharing my feelings or deep conversations (but that's just me because I know my family). So far it's worked out - I felt that when they stopped seeing me everyday, they try to avoid drama and just want to have fun.Change can be scary, but things might turn out better than you expect. Stay positive, I'm sure it'll all work out for the best!
nut6ss,You are right, I‚Äôm sure things will be fine in the long run. It really does feel scary right now! Trying to stay positive :D
nut6ss,I needed to hear this but the only caveat I have is that I also contribute a lot of money to my mother because she is older and retired and I make more than my siblings.
nut6ss,I went through the same thing and so did some other people I know.  We all agree on a point: we have better relationships with our families by NOT living with them.It‚Äôs ok. You‚Äôll be ok. You‚Äôll establish a ‚Äú new normal‚Äù.  Good luck to you!
nut6ss,It‚Äôs soo nice knowing I‚Äôm not alone! I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more. I haven‚Äôt lived with my parents for a year and I have not had trouble with my dad since!
nut6ss,So I‚Äôve gone through this, I‚Äôm 38, moved away from home, career woman with a partner but no kids (from a traditional Midwestern family) and it‚Äôs still hard and probably always will be. Family dynamics are just one of those things that never gets much easier. My best advice? Surround yourself with a family of your choosing - friends. Develop your own traditions like friends giving, annual birthday parties, etc. or if that‚Äôs not possible, develop your own routines and traditions. Go out and do things by yourself, concerts, shows, nice dinners. Live life to the fullest don‚Äôt be afraid! Some of my happiest most peaceful days are the ones I spend alone just doing whatever I want.
nut6ss,I love this! I have always 100% believed in living life to the fullest! Thank you for the advice!
nut6ss,Thank you so much for sharing your experience. I think you truly understand and I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through all that. I feel like alienation lies ahead for me as well and it feels way less hard knowing someone else dealt with this and made it out okay!
nut6ss,The thing with life is people come and go. I think the key point is treasuring the good memories.You could choose to stay and accept them for what they are but I don't think that's what you want. Once you make choices, you have to deal with the consequences.
nut6ss,That is very true. The scary part is nobody knows if they are making the right choice till after the fact. What you said reminds me of that saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be sad it‚Äôs over, be glad it happened‚Äù.
o2zlnw,I mean... It sounds like trying to get him to talk about this is gonna torture him. You're right, sounds like he's buried so many layers deep in the closet that he isn't going to come out until he's 50.I'd say you've got three choices;Keep having casual sexual encounters with him and just accept that it is what it isRefuse to keep doing sexual stuff with him until he can talk about it like an adult and acknowledge what's happeningPeace out of the whole thing and go back to just being friends.Your pick.
o2zlnw,Yep I don‚Äôt see OP fixing anything. So I think 1 and 3 are the options here.
o2zlnw,wasn't going online fishing for straight dick, it was pretty much always friends or acquaintances.I guess this is being a bit pedantic, but I don't think those guys you hooked up with were straight.
o2zlnw,You don't have to have robotic sex if you don't want to. Just stop coming onto him and wait for him to initiate, clearly without code. He's capable of being blunt, he offered you a blow job that first time, but I think he's settled into this idea that its not gay if you guide him to it.
o2zlnw,I really agree with this. Just stop trying to make it happen, go back to acting like he did before when they really were just friends. Give his friend space to either initiate or bring the issue up.
o2zlnw,It sounds like this is all it‚Äôs going to be.If you try to make it more than just hush hush hookups it‚Äôs probably going to be emotional torture for you so I would back away personally. If this guy really is gay or bi or whatever he sounds like one of those late in life dudes who will finally come out in his 40s.Bottom line, you‚Äôll be better served dating someone who is out, unless you want to put in a bunch of unreciprocated emotional work with potentially no payoff.
o2zlnw,Dude there‚Äôs no ‚Äúif‚Äù about it. Lol
o2zlnw,So‚Ä¶. Here‚Äôs the thing. I remember realizing I liked girl (I‚Äôm a woman, 28). It scared the absolute shit outta me and took me a long time to come to terms with it even after coming out of the closet. And coming out the first time was traumatic for me as I wasn‚Äôt ready and my parents found out by accident.There is more to it to each person than we may think. For me, I‚Äôm Catholic and so I not only had to wrestle with societal issues with liking women but also dealing with my God about it. On top of THAT I had to deal with the affect it had on the relationship with my parents who I was close to. (Which my parents came around and were super close. And then I married a man. Go figure.)So really at this point, don‚Äôt make him talk. He has to deal with all those feelings on his own. What YOU can do is decide if you want to keep doing this or stay friends or cut off contact altogether. I would wait for him to be ready to talk. If you want to a simple ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to talk to me now but whenever you‚Äôre ready to talk about what you‚Äôre feeling I‚Äôm here‚Äù is fine I think (hard to gauge from just a post) but don‚Äôt try to make him. That just turns out bad for everyone.
o2zlnw,Honestly, I would stop hooking up with him. I‚Äôm a lesbian and this situation would completely weird me out. I‚Äôve hooked up with girls who have identified as ‚Äústraight‚Äù before but we‚Äôve always been able to talk about it more or less. He sounds like he‚Äôs waaayyy deep in Narnia‚Äôs closet and I wouldn‚Äôt expect much from him if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre hoping for. I feel bad for him and the internalized homophobia he appears to be struggling hard with. How does he act when you‚Äôre, ya know, cleaning up when you‚Äôre done? He‚Äôs completely silent the entire time and changes the conversation to something else, avoiding it all completely?If you value his friendship, stop having sex with him. Continue hanging out and keep it strictly platonic and see what happens on his end ‚Äî if anything. I won‚Äôt be surprised if he doesn‚Äôt bring it up.If you want to be bold (like I probably would be), ask him gently what‚Äôs going on and what he‚Äôs thinking about. Make the space seem safe and open. I only advise you to be careful. He could be so uncomfortable at the very thought of any kind of conversation surrounding this that he could lash out aggressively/physically.
o2zlnw,It doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs his expectations you‚Äôre worried about but your own. You can‚Äôt make someone be more comfortable with something than what they are, and frankly you shouldn‚Äôt try to. If having sex with men in the closet isn‚Äôt your thing, then stop having sex with a man in the closet. If you‚Äôre going to continue engaging with ‚Äòstraight‚Äô men who are in closet, then this type of thing is exactly what you should expect.
o2zlnw,Aww poor guy!If a relationship doesn't work for you, stop doing it. You can work out with him, but don't have sex. If he starts using code words, just ignore like you don't know what he is talking about.I mean, he's old enough to be introspective and stop using using you. Being afraid to come out is no reason to treat other people like trash.
o2zlnw,Yeah I would dip. This has the potential to turn into a huge mess.
o2zlnw,Unless you want to keep on doing it like this you need to tell him to either talk about it or stop doing it. He'll probably say he doesn't wanna talk about it, in which case say okay but we can't keep having awkward sex, let's just go back to being friends.
o2zlnw,doesn‚Äôt sound like the safest situation to be putting yourself in sexually tbh
o2zlnw,This scares me. Anyone this deep in the closet is going to be unpredictable. I think its safest to break things off.
o2zlnw,I very much agree with this sentiment. What if he suddenly snaps and realizes he doesn't like what he's been doing and then takes it out on OP?  Denies that he's been consenting? Possibly gets violent?I'd be worried about that and keep my guard up OP.
o2zlnw,I feel the same. This could be dangerous, not just emotionally.
o2zlnw,If the sex (the whole experience) feels good,  keep doing it if you want to.If it doesn't,  stop doing it.You can't solve this guy's issues,  whatever they are.All you can do is decide what YOU want to do.
nb1jcp,First off talk to a lawyer. Find out if you have any claims to custody whatsoever where you live.  This is going to be controversial and I'll get downvoted for this, but find out if there are things you can subtly do right now before telling Bob you want to leave that might help you obtain custody in the event that you and Bob separate.  Example: Legally adopt Ben. You can also be strategic in setting up some fail safes now in case things escalate when you do tell Bob you're leaving (send both boys to a summer camp away from Bob this summer and pay in advance, for example). Also find out if Ben has options for emancipation. Look for a local organization that serves teens who are gender and sexual minorities. Ask if they have referrals to some legal advocates or lawyers.  It doesn't matter what Ben's sexuality is, someone who can legally argue that the homophobia constitutes abuse (if it has reached that level) might be able to point you in the direction of next steps here. Also look into laws where you live in regards to other services.  Can Ben, for example, access therapy where you live without Bob knowing about it? In some places he can do that the second he turns 16.  Getting him established with a therapist now and making sure the therapist is appraised of the situation might be very helpful to Ben. Think about other ways to ensure he has some independence.  Make sure, for example, that both boys are able to get a driver's license the second they legally can and, if you have the resources, provide Ben with a car solely in his name or in yours. Make sure you have copies of any legal paperwork he may need (social security card, if applicable, any information on inheritance he may have from his parents and maybe even documents needed for FASA). Put the boys cellphones in your name. Depending on how well he is doing in school you could talk to his teachers about options to graduate a year early, take college classes now (which means he has enrolled in college and his guardian will need to have already filled out that paperwork), summer programs that involve living outside the home, and/or boarding school options that might not be the military school.Also consider who else is in Ben's life who might be watching out for him, even people you haven't really thought about or who Bob might have alienated before you came along but who would be happy to step-in. Did either of Ben's parent's have another sibling, for example? Are there grandparents involved? It may be that there is someone out there who could not step-up four-five years ago who now is in a different position to be involved. If that person or people exist. Foster some connections with them now.From there, you need to talk to the boys (the children, not your partner). As others are suggesting it makes sense to have an idea of what you can and cannot offer Ben before doing so. Be very clear that you support him no matter what and that you want to make sure he is okay. Be very clear that you'll be fighting hard for him to come live with you and that the second he legally can he is welcome to do so, even if that means he shows up at your door on his 18th birthday.  Keep paying for the phone (or maybe even a different one Bob doesn't know about), keep paying for the therapy, keep paying for the car. Keep trying to have him over or have custody. And make a safety plan with him for surviving the next year or two with Bob.  Be clear about after school jobs, school programs, applying himself so he gets the most funding for college away from Bob possible, etc. Basically you need to be able to help him get out of that house whenever possible and help him feel empowered to call for help if things truly reach dangerous levels.If they do reach dangerous levels, that's when you have the best chance to try to get him out of that house.
nb1jcp,Can I just say OP, you raised a damn good boy in Kevin, the emotional maturity and empathy he‚Äôs shown in this situation is astonishing. It warms my heart to know Ben must also be a wonderful kid to bring out such a fiercely protective response from Kevin.With that being said, the first thing I thought after finishing this post was ‚Äúokay, so play nice until you can legally adopt Ben and build your case, then drop that facade with quickness and get away from this sorry excuse for a man.‚Äù I agree with absolutely everything this user has said, it was super well thought out and points out some awesome resources. Once you get closer to having this plan in place (and I mean a day away from being able to implement everything if the green light is given,) I would say discuss the details with Ben. It would be unfortunate if anything was leaked to your husband while you‚Äôre planning an escape route and he iced up and made things much more difficult. At 15, with Ben being your legal son, he most likely wouldn‚Äôt be forced into a situation with split custody if he wanted to only live with you and Kevin. Depending on the state teenagers are very rarely forced into living arrangements that they‚Äôre staunchly against. The implication of Ben‚Äôs choice to live purely with his adoptive parent will not go unnoticed from a judge when it comes time to make a decision.
nb1jcp,Thank you so much for your comprehensive comment, your suggestions have given me a lot to think about in terms of putting together a back-up plan!
nb1jcp,I agree with finding an attorney. Ben shouldn‚Äôt be forced to live with a guardian who is openly hostile towards them. I can see bob taking out his anger at this poor kid.
nb1jcp,"...this is going to be controversial"Doesn't look like anything to me.  Good advice here.
nb1jcp,Is there some kind of event or thing that OP can encourage Ben to participate in that would be easier if she were a legal guardian?That way she could use that as an excuse to seek legal guardianship rather than bringing it up out of the blue. It might be kinda suspicious otherwise.
nb1jcp,So you've gotten good advice here.Just to reiterate:Talk to Ben. Tell him that he always has a home with you, and that you're not going to do anything which will make his home situation unstable. Tell him you love him and appreciate him for who he is, and that you know things are fraught. (I know you don't particularly think Ben is gay - but I think you should talk to him in a way that makes clear that you don't care, without saying as much.)Talk to a lawyer. Find out how, if you kick Bob out, Ben can stay. How old does he have to be to make that choice? You want to avoid a legal fight, but it's good to know what the law is.Talk to your son. Tell him you appreciate him standing up for Ben to Bob. Tell him that you agree that Bob is behaving unacceptably. Tell him that you're trying to figure out a way to keep Ben safe from Bob, and that you will never take Bob's side over him and Ben. Tell him you recognize that the current situation with Bob is unhealthy for everyone, and that you're actively trying to figure out a way to resolve it while protecting Ben.Don't tell Bob any of this. Have all these conversations quietly until you're ready to take action because you've had the discussion with a lawyer. Furthermore, once you're ready to take action, talk to Ben and Jason BEFORE you tell Bob.
nb1jcp,Thank you very much for saying this! I must admit in all of this I have gone from trying to smooth things between them and Bob to trying to find a way out for all of us, and have not prioritised communicating with the boys as much as I could have. I am going to try to get some alone time with each of them this weekend to at least reassure them that I see what's happening and value them.
nb1jcp,Awesome advice! OP is definitely in a terrifying situation and I‚Äôm worried and sad for her and the boys. Why do men have to have this fragile masculine that they feel the need to project onto young boys?!
nb1jcp,Have you talked to Ben about how he feels about Bob? What sort of rapport do you two have?If you haven‚Äôt, I think you should sit down with him and tell him that, no matter where he came from or what his preferences are, you love him and you want to support him. Let him know that you are upset with how Bob treats him, and that you want to make sure he is ok. Tell him you want to be a positive part of his life, and that you need his help in understanding what this looks like.If it takes more than one conversation to build this rapport, keep trying. Then, when you feel confident you know what he needs, reach out to an attorney and ask what your options might be for emancipation of Ben from Bob.
nb1jcp,Also, be sure to let Ben know that he will always have a place in your home.
nb1jcp,Try to find out how Ben can become emancipated. He will likely be granted this if he can present evidence that living with Bob is detrimental and that he is mature and of sound mind. The fact that he would be living with you and his "brother" would also likely be a huge benefit.Edit: I just found out he has to be 16 but by the time Bob is out of the picture completely it will probably be at least 6 months.
nb1jcp,This is the answer. No need to adopt, help him become independent.
nb1jcp,It‚Äôs good to get an early start anyways! Prepare everything he‚Äôll need, get him a job, start recording evidence, and researching the matter fully.
nb1jcp,I wish I had a good answer for you because I can't imagine how awful you must be feeling.  I think you might be best off consulting a lawyer?  After 4 years I doubt you can try to fight for guardianship, but maybe with your help Ben could get emancipated?  Because I don't think staying together with Bob for Ben's sake is feasible, it sounds like it would destroy you.  Maybe letting Ben know he could always call you for help and is welcome to move in when he's 18 would help him get through the next couple years?  If Bob got actually abusive left to his own devices then Ben could escape sooner.  Poor kid, he's lucky to have you and Jason in his life at least.
nb1jcp,I would sit down with the boys and think of a game plan for the 3 of you. What is the age of emancipation in your state? That may be an option, and you would only have to stick it out with Bob maybe another year?
nb1jcp,Talk to Bob and let him know you want to legally adopt Ben. Probably wise not to mention it's as break-up custody insurance. Just say that you've really come to see him as family, and both boys as your sons, and you want to make it official.If Bob agrees, you'll have some play for custody.Also, you aren't morally obligated to be in a sexual relationship with someone who you dislike to stay in Ben's life. That's not a fair requirement. I know you are worried the boys will hate or be mad at you, including your son Jason. But I'd talk to Jason honestly one on one if/when you do break up with Bob. Tell him that you love Ben and want to look out for him and stay in his life as much as you can, and you've been staying in the relationship for a while for that reason, but you've reached the point where you just can't keep being with a man who you don't see as a good person. I would hope that Jason, who you say is naturally protective, will understand and be protective of you his own mother if you show him your feelings/good intentions, rather then condemn you for not prostituting yourself. I very much doubt your son would expect that of you. None of us expect that of you.As for Ben, if you break up and Bob won't let you have any custody, talk to Ben about it. Tell him you love him, you see him as a son, and the way Bob treats him is wrong (and why you don't respect Bob?). Tell Ben that he has done nothing wrong, and you very much want to stay a part of his life, and you will try to as much as Bob allows, but current situation is [blah]. You'll be talking to a lawyer. And that if nothing else Ben should know that he's always welcome to move back in the minute he turns eighteen.
nb1jcp,Also, you aren't morally obligated to be in a sexual relationship with someone who you dislike to stay in Ben's life. That's not a fair requirement. I know you are worried the boys will hate or be mad at you, including your son Jason. But I'd talk to Jason honestly one on one if/when you do break up with Bob. Tell him that you love Ben and want to look out for him and stay in his life as much as you can, and you've been staying in the relationship for a while for that reason, but you've reached the point where you just can't keep being with a man who you don't see as a good person. I would hope that Jason, who you say is naturally protective, will understand and be protective of you his own mother if you show him your feelings/good intentions, rather then condemn you for not prostituting yourself. I very much doubt your son would expect that of you. None of us expect that of you.Thank you for saying that. You are right, I know Jason would understand if I explained to him. I think my real problem is that if something happened to Ben I would have a hard time forgiving myself. At the moment I'm hoping it won't come to either of those situations, the comments here have given me some hope and I am going to speak to a lawyer about our options.
nb1jcp,Have you asked Bob about you adopting Ben? Surely if you two were contemplating marriage you discussed it at some point?What about emancipating Ben? Honestly, I feel like from what you've said Bob would not be super upset about letting Ben live with you until he's 18, when you and Bob break up.
nb1jcp,You‚Äôve received some good advice OP so I just wanted to say how lovely it is that Ben has you and your son. Thanks for caring for him I‚Äôm sure it will have a lifelong impact on him. I hope that you manage to have Ben live with you long term without bob using the advice given here, definitely sounds like you need family law advice. All the best, please share an update in time?
kothne,I have a different take. Does she have issues with her  nose/sinuses? I have allergies and seem to be prone to sinus infections. One of the things my husband noticed is that during a flare up, I will unthinkingly eat with my mouth open... because I can't breathe. You can absolutely frame your noticing as a concern for her.If that turns out to not be why, feel free to let her know you are struggling with something that you need her help with. Yeah, she might feel embarrassed, but if it's as bad as I imagine, you might be saving her from a more embarrassing situation.
kothne,I have a different take. Does she have issues with her nose/sinuses? I have allergies and seem to be prone to sinus infections. One of the things my husband noticed is that during a flare up, I will unthinkingly eat with my mouth open... because I can't breathe. You can absolutely frame your noticing as a concern for her.That hadn't even occurred to me, but yes it's possible. Don't want to go into identifying levels of detail, but... very possible. Thank you! Useful thing to think about.
kothne,This. My ex was always mad if my mouth came open while eating, but i do have horrendous allergies. Fucker couldn‚Äôt be fussed about his own epic snoring though.
kothne,I was totally going to mention this. My das has a deviated septum and because of this he chews with his mouth open. And snores horrendously...
kothne,Or TMJ. It might hurt to chew so she chews that way without thinking about it.
kothne,This is 100% me. When my nose is to stuffy I eat with my mouth open since I cant breath and eat when my nose is clogged up.
kothne,So so true. I struggle with sinus and during flare ups i eat and sleep with my mouth open and my snoring gets horrible.
kothne,You could atleast bring the topic up gently and tell her that it's a little bothering. Maybe she knows it already? Someone must have told her about this at some point, I guess. But maybe hearing it from you again will force her to be mindful of it in the future. Specially in public places and professional settings where she could be stared at and judged. So yeah bring it up gently.
kothne,My dude, you have to tell her. It's not something that you will be able to live with without getting mad about it in your head and that won't help your relationship. Just tall with her, it's not the end of the world.My girlfriend ate normal when I met her, but I have misophonia and I couldn't handle her eating chips. So we talked and now she eats them differently and more slowly so I don't get angry af every time she chews a chip down her throat.
kothne,This is the tricky thing though. If I could just say "there's nothing wrong with you, it's me, I have this condition" then I wouldn't feel nearly so concerned about hurting her feelings, but I don't think I do suffer from misophonia to any meaningful extent. I haven't had the chance to ask other people if they're bothered by her eating habits, but honestly I'd be surprised if anyone isn't. How do you tell a 30-year-old woman that the way she's been eating this whole time is obnoxious to the vast majority of people without completely humiliating her? And what response can I really expect anyway? I'd be amazed if nobody's told her before, but she's still doing it...
kothne,I also have misophonia and my boyfriend does this for me as well.
kothne,I had a similar problem with my girl. Not chewing, but swallowing when she drinks. Its like a loud, cartoonish GULP, GULP. GULP. One time I tested it, and I heard it across a mediul sized room with cars driving by outside.I've simply learnt to live with it and ignore it by now. But not necessarily saying thats the solution for you OP. I think its easier to change how you eat rather than how you drink.
kothne,Be honest with her. Be kind to her about it and try your best to get your point across. I think that it will benefit the both of you if you talk to her about it.I had this conversation with my partner. We are so comfortable with each other and I guess after 7+ years of being together, not much is off limits to say or do around each otherüòÖ I told him that his eating habits were really stressing me out and if he could try to work on it, that‚Äôs all I could ask for. If he forgets, I remind him about it, nicely ofcourse. Now I don‚Äôt get randomly anxious and he doesn‚Äôt get confused why I‚Äôm anxious and aggravated with him. It‚Äôs much better to be open and honest with your partner, even if it‚Äôs painful or scary sometimes. Best of luck, please keep us updated! üòå
kothne,More info required. Does she have her mouth closed while chewing? If so, not sure if there is something she can do differently? If not, ‚Äòhey babe, you are eating with your mouth open today, can u not? ta‚Äô.
kothne,She's eating with her mouth open. You make it sound very simple to casually point that out, but what if she's mortified? Shouldn't I be taking the conversation at least a little bit seriously? And shouldn't I acknowledge the possibility that it might be bothering me more than it does other people? The whole pandemic situation has meant that we've never really eaten together around other people, so I have no way to check at this point.
kothne,I think it depends a lot on what kind of person she is - self-conscious and insecure vs laidback and unbothered. If the former, just bring it up directly. "Hey, this could just be a 'me' thing but sometimes the way you chew your food is a little loud (/insert adjective here)." If you think a more subtle approach might be better, frame it as "I just read this post where someone was worried about telling their partner about some embarrassing behavior. If there's ever anything I do that's weird, here's how I would want you to bring it up to me. How would you want me to bring it up to you?" and then wait maybe a month, if you can, and say "So you remember when we talked about telling each other about embarrassing behaviors? Well....."My partner sometimes eats his food very loudly with lots of lip smacking, but I don't really remember how I first brought it up. I think I just got his attention (we have slightly different routines so I was already in bed reading to fall asleep, while he had headphones on watching something) and gave him a pointed look and he got it? That's definitely all it takes now anyway. But if your gf isn't aware of the problem/think it's normal that probably won't work.
kothne,Good advice, thank you. I'm a bad bullshitter so I'm going to try to be direct with her, hopefully without being unkind.
i52nid,I would have your partner sit down with their father and just have an open discussion about what's going on and what his expectations here are. You don't have to be aggressive or threaten anything, just be open and listen, but make sure you get an answer from him. Maybe he will say there's something he's waiting for and he will leave xyz and you can avoid the conflict by allowing him to take that extra time. If he refuses to provide you with a timeline, or gives you one that's unreasonable, then I would have your SO say that's not realistic and then discuss his options with him.
i52nid,Thank you. We've written out what she plans to say. I think in hindsight he's just used to taking advantage of folks who let him. We will need to be firm. But kind.
i52nid,This!I don‚Äôt think evicting your father in law is the best first step. Just have a discussion, hear him out, but also set your expectations. You now own the property and with the intention of using it for breaks.If that fails - change the locks.I do have to ask though. Why specifically one month a year?
i52nid,Other responses are looking a lot like r/legaladvice territory. I do agree with other posters that having your spouse talk with their parent might be more direct. If a clear schedule (yay boundaries!) can be established this might be salvageable. Beyond that, it seems like this is more complex than just a relationship problem. Best of luck, OP.
i52nid,He took your money and is now preventing you or anyone else from using it as he agreed. I would offer him an opportunity to vacate with a frank conversation about your expectations, and if he refuses to abide by the agreement, begin the process of legal eviction.I understand the delicate nature of family transactions, but at some point you have to conclude that it was his intention from the beginning to take your money and take advantage of your kindness (that he perceives as weakness).
i52nid,I'd offer to sell it back to him for exactly what you put into it, including any real estate commissions and fees. If he won't do that, then it's eviction time. Owning it means you decide who stays there and when.
i52nid,I was going to say that OP should casually mention that they're thinking of putting the property up for sale since they rarely use it.
i52nid,Lots of people giving great advice here but I want to focus on the COVID-19 angle: the world is strange and scary right now. A 78 year-old is in a pretty high risk category.It would be compassionate to talk with him about other possibilities for his living situation and what his fears are. You mention he has his own place, but simple things about daily life - shopping, laundry, getting around, people he might interact with - might be holding him back. You (and/or your wife, his daughter) need to have a firm but compassionate and caring talk with him.
i52nid,He makes quick trips to his full time home for supplies, doctor appointments etc. Since May he's been 3 weeks/month at our place, one week/month at his own place.
i52nid,Yea, if his "full time home" is in a much more populated area, he might be afraid to go back home.Also, eviction laws and such are being changed in certain places due to Covid.
i52nid,I would try to dig a little to see if you can get to the root of the problem. "Hey Dad, I notice you want to stay in the house next month and you've already been there since June. I am wondering what is going on with that." Or "It looks like you are having a hard time going back to your other house. What's going on with that" If you can do it in a way that doesn't put him on the defensive,  maybe you can find out what needs he is meeting by staying in the vacation house. So start by listening and confirming. Then, depending on what the issues are,  you can deal with them or help him deal with them. It also gives you an opening to say something along the lines that you want him to get his needs met, but you also have needs, primarily the planned vacation. He has a reason that he is overstepping,  and if you can get to the root of that,  then maybe you will be able to help him in addition to getting your much-needed, well-deserved vacation
i52nid,Just a thought - I wouldn‚Äôt phrase it ‚Äúyour other house‚Äù. It‚Äôs his home, OPs house is no longer his.
i52nid,At this point I would get eviction paperwork in order. You are dealing with the elderly and one wrong step, and you have social services and the county prosecutor giving you flack for elder abuse.
i52nid,Hadn't thought of that. Thanks!
i52nid,Lol this is terrible advice.A conversation should be had prior to jumping to the last resort and damaging the relationship with her father.Sometimes people don't realise how unreasonable they're being until they're told.  This could be especially true for a 78 year old whose in the vulnerable category for COVID.
i52nid,Is this agreement in writing?  You are going to want to get a lawyer involved so you can change the locks to the house and lock the father in law out of the house next time he leaves and then deliver his property back to him.
n5hlsh,It sounds like trying to rationally convince your parents of your position has not worked for you. I think you have two approaches you can take going forward.First, you could find someone else who your parents will listen to. Could you get someone from the school for disabilities to speak with your parents honestly? Perhaps a teacher or the parent of another student? A doctor? Alternatively, do you know any other families with a Deaf child, or Deaf families, who could speak to the importance of a specialized education?Second, you could start your conversation with your parents not with an argument, but with a genuine listening ear. It sounds like they are exhausted and frustrated, and this might be impacting their decisions. Ask them how they're feeling. Say you just want to understand their decision, you don't want to fight about it, and then actually try to understand it.This may take a few conversations for them to let their guard down. But if they seem receptive to hearing your feelings, tell them what you said here: "I feel like I've been made to be an adult since I was so young. But now when I want to be part of the adult decision-making in this family, you're shutting me out, and that makes me feel frustrated and angry. I also feel defensive of my sister - I want the best possible education for her, where she feels affirmed and supported and can communicate with the people around her. Can you understand those feelings?"When someone is making a bad decision, empathy can go a lot farther than arguments. This goes for them too - if you just ask them to understand your feelings, they might be more willing to hear you out than if you ask them to admit they were wrong and transfer your sister to the other school.You may also have to play the long game here, ultimately. If your parents remain steadfast in their choice, you may have to let your sister go to this school for a year. Take note of how her behaviour changes, whether she likes the school, whether she makes friends or has any other Deaf children to play with, and so on. She can always transfer out, and your parents may be more willing to try the other school if they see that this one has a negative impact on her.
n5hlsh,Thanks for this. I think the main issue is that my mom and dad just learned ASL and assumed the issues raising a deaf child ended there. Ana has actually never met another deaf person before, let alone another family and we don't have any hearing impaired relatives. They have a very heavy focus on raising her 'normally' and see any challenges as defects in her rather than their own limitations. I might try and reach out to local groups in my area for advice on this but due to COVID and resistance from my parents, this might be difficult.I think another issue in discussing this stems from the fact that their parenting has always been very 'hands off', emotionally-speaking, so if and when Ana gets into trouble they don't really take the time to understand why she's doing what she's doing. They don't know a great deal about deaf culture or how deaf people might see or interact with the world.I'm aware I might seem like a know-it-all or a brat and I really don't mean to be critical of my parents, I just wish they'd be a bit more flexible in their thinking, especially when it comes to Ana. They don't like to admit they don't know everything and I often worry this is going to affect Ana more harshly as she grows up.
n5hlsh,dad to a deaf daughter here.based solely on what you have written, it sounds like the deaf school would be a good compromise. caters specifically to deaf needs while not simply being a ‚Äúspecial needs‚Äù school.i know my daughter gets a lot of reassurance and benefit from interacting with both hearing and deaf people. so you should at least try to convince/facilitate that, seperate from any schooling situation.
n5hlsh,Maybe bring up the possibility of an evaluation by a pediatric occupational therapist- they're trained professionals to evaluate a child's occupational profile and whether she's ready for school and which type of school would be best for her, taking her resources and barriers into consideration.And maybe instead of arguing with a "I know this is best" approach, which your parents have obviously already disregarded, try to understand their reasoning for choosing said school, because in your post you haven't mentioned why they want to send her to a special needs school, only that they want to do it.It may come across differently when they speak to a professional.
n5hlsh,You‚Äôll need more than anOT.  I am a pediatric OT and I know we are awesome but we are not qualified to evaluate the WHOLE scope of things that are relevant here.  The school psychologist would be the one to evaluate a student‚Äôs intellectual potential (like via IQ test or whatever) and rule in or rule out things like a learning disability.  I would also include folks like the local pediatric physical therapist to certify that sis has the mobility to access a regular school environment (as things like gait are not within the scope of practice of an OT.
n5hlsh,I‚Äôm a pediatric OT and from the post, I would think a school for the deaf and hard of hearing would be the best option. I obviously don‚Äôt know the kid, so take that opinion with a grain of salt.More importantly, I would tell your parents to talk to her public school. If you are in the US, she would likely fall under IDEA or section 504. Either way, if parents make it known to the public school that they want her in a school for the deaf, the public school will likely pay for her to go there because they aren‚Äôt able to provide the same level of education. It‚Äôs often times easier for them to pay for kids to go somewhere that already has everything in place vs hiring a sign language interpreter and having to find creative ways to help her communicate and develop social relationships with peers who might not know sign language.I‚Äôve served students that have attended our local school for the deaf and it is AMAZING! They have students with behaviors and other disabilities as well, on top of the hearing impairments, but the big thing is that they are exposed to other kids who use sign language, teachers who teach both verbally and in sign, and they provide wealths of knowledge and resources to families.Good luck, OP! I‚Äôm glad your sister has you to advocate for her!
n5hlsh,I'd have thought there'd be a proper assessment involved in sending her to a school for significantly disabled kids, personally.
n5hlsh,If you can't convince your parents to give the school for the deaf a shot, maybe ask them to compromise and get Ana involved in some community programs for the deaf. Maybe there are meetups for deaf kids, a camp---anything to get her around other people who are deaf. It's actually an incredibly rich culture and I'm sure it would help her to meet other people around her age who are facing the same challenges--and it could have the added bonus of showing your parents that deafness isn't a mental/behavioral issue, but just a difference, and a difference that our society has come a long way toward accommodating.
n5hlsh,Hey, as a deaf person myself, I appreciate the thought you are putting into this.So I volunteer with other deaf people and specifically deaf children as well, and the only people I've ever saw that was not in the mainstream or deaf specific schools were the kids who had needs that extended beyond communication.If Ana requires an interpreter to understand a normal conversation, mainstream school will likely only be a hindrance. I know because I was mainstream schooled myself, and although I am exceptionally good at lipreading, I needed my ability to hear in order to understand the topics being taught. And whilst I could have had an interpreter the entire time when I was at school, it would have been a hassle.So from what I understand, she will need to go to a school that caters to disabled people, preferably for deaf people specifically.I'm not sure if you are aware, but there are those in the deaf community that do not consider themselves to be a "disabled person". This doesn't mean that they don't agree that their deafness is a disability, but moreso that they don't identify with the connotations behind "disabled". As being deaf is more about just having a different way/level of communication.I don't pretend to know the extent of Ana's medical problems, but from what you have said about deafness being her only disability (even if she did have behavioural problems), I think she might eventually resent the fact that she is in a school where she is being labeled disabled in the same context as those with more severe disabilities and needs. At least, I think that's what I might come to think, if I was put into a general special needs school.From what you told us, her best bet at schooling IMO would be a deaf school. Firstly, a deaf school would be more than able to deal with behavioural problems. Aside from the fact that the main communication is sign language, it's a regular school that will be able to deal with various behavioural problems (especially since it's a elementary school, where lots of kids might have temper tantrums and such).Secondly, I think that potentially sending a her to a general special needs school could exaggerate how "disabled" she might feel, when in actuality, she just needs to have a different method of communication with others.So in order to talk with your parents about it, I think firstly persuade them to talk to an pediatric audiologist. They will be able to tell your parents a lot about what would be the best option for Ana in terms of schooling.If you are also in the discussion with the pediatric audiologist, you can bring up the points you have about the fact that you don't think she has behavioural problems, and say you think it's because she is bored from not being able to understand things (something that the pediatric audiologist might corroborate with you on as it is quite common in deaf children).
n5hlsh,This was an amazing read and I really thank you for your insight. What you say makes a lot of sense. For the last six years I've been using ASL in regular conversation and - to me at least - it feels so natural and in the context of our home, I struggle to remember that to the outside world, Ana is considered 'disabled'. To me, she's the little monkey that pins her drawings up in my office and likes to climb in places she shouldn't. I mentioned in my edit that I contacted a deaf advocacy group to see about Ana maybe meeting up with other deaf/HOH people once COVID is no longer an issue.
n5hlsh,Are you in USA? If so, your parents should contact their school district and ask for an evaluation. She‚Äôd get evaluated by the school psychologist, hearing specialist, speech therapist, etc.  All free of charge. The team will assess her and determine appropriate placement. If she needs a specialized school for children who are deaf/hard of hearing/etc. they will provide that placement. If the school is outside of the school‚Äôs boundaries then they will provide transportation. Look into IEP and FAPE.
n5hlsh,Yes, I agree. He can say he spoke to other people and this was suggested. At least it might make them question their decision.
n5hlsh,Have you gotten involved with the deaf community?  It might be helpful to find deaf adults and introduce your parents to them. The deaf community is a very tight community and has an amazing culture which she would benefit from tremendously. I think other deaf people could make a stronger case by telling their own stories. Also if she is qualified for an implant deaf schools are well qualified to help with this as well.
n5hlsh,Does anyone else remember this post from like months ago???
n5hlsh,It does seem awfully familiar to me too.
n5hlsh,I am a parent of a child with special needs. I sent my child to a school for kids with special needs because they were equipped to handle a broad spectrum of needs and then my kid was able to transition out of that school and leave special education behind and one of the things they have taken from their past experience is acceptance and understanding of kids with all ranges of ability. It was good for me too. Maybe give this a chance and see how it goes and how it works for her. She will learn skills specific to her needs and meet other kids like herself and different from her and see that communities include all kinds of people. We need all people to be included and if your sister transitions out of that school into a regular education public school, she will bring so many tools with her and she will have an advantage going in.
n5hlsh,Schools for students with special needs are wonderful, if they're the right fit. But it really seems like people in this thread aren't listening to OP and are siding with the parents by default. It does not sound like OP's sister has special needs. She doesn't have any learning disabilities, and her behavioral problems are completely expected for a kid who's deaf-  if can't hear the performance at a theatre and is being made to sit through a show she can't hear or understand, of course she's going to get bored and antsy. I would make noises too! That's not a behavioral problem, that's an understimulated and underserved child.This sounds to me like a child who is being shunted off to a school for children with disabilities that are different from hers. The parents thinking seems to be, 'well she has disabilities, so we'll send her to a disability school.' There's a school for the deaf in the area! And yet they are not considering the school that is specifically for her. It can do a lot of damage to a child's learning to be placed in a school for the disabled. There's stigma that carries over when and if they move to a public school after. There's a lowered expectation of learning, there's fewer learning resources for bright kids in those places and it might be very easy for her to fall behind her age group. I'm very worried for OP's sister, and very worried that the people in this thread are dismissing OP the same as his parents.
n5hlsh,It sounds like the school will still be able to educate your sister extremely well even without a current deaf program. Having the ability to put into place personalized support for each child sounds like what the school does.  That's important. Because of that, even if there's a place you'd feel is better, their decision is ok.  You don't have to agree with your parents and they don't have to agree with you but since they are the parents their decision will of course trump yours, even if you are extremely close to your sister. Frankly, what's best for your parents is also a realistic factor in this decision.Your parents have made it very clear they're not interested in your opinion on this. Because of how you handled this it will limit your ability to influence them on this subject in the future. At this point the most productive approach might be to see how your sister actually does and then reflect back to your parents any actualized issues that you see.
n5hlsh,This is how I feel.  OPs opinions are totally valid and probably what's best for his sibling but "because I said so" holds a lot of power.  He probably just needs to let it go for the time being and hope the school soon recognizes his sisters abilities and disabilities and recommends a better program for her sooner than later.
n5hlsh,I knew a girl at my highschool who was deaf and had a translator there to translate what the teacher was saying and was in normal classes. The one she was in with me was specifically engineering. She was a normal person and it seemed everything worked for her.
n9q8k4,I don't think you're in the wrong here.  Yes you could have been more sensitive about it which you acknowledge and should apologize for but I really don't think you're in the wrong.You're being held to an impossible standard and that's 100% unfair to you. You can't even celebrate your own accomplishments with out her trying to make it all about him.It sucks that it came to a head like this but used this as a chance to finally address this issue.
n9q8k4,You cannot move forward in your relationship with a dead guy hanging over the two of you. Yes she can grieve and miss him. That isn‚Äôt what she is doing. She is using him as a tool to aid in making you feel less than someone else. Seriously. She needs counselling.
n9q8k4,Absolutely this! She's not being fair. You didn't do anything wrong.
n9q8k4,It's often very hard to say things calmly or reasonably, when you are hurt or angry. You don't say if you have talked to her about the issue. You really should. She hasn't moved past her late bf. People only remember the good stuff when people die, never the bad stuff. You can never be his equal, because he is dead. He can't screw up.It is not fair for her to compare the two of you. You need to tell her how it makes you feel. She is free to remember him in her mind. But not in yours.
n9q8k4,Like the others, it's not weird that you feel like this. Comparing your current partner to an ex like that is not ok, even if he's dead.Yeah, you could have worded that better, but that doesn't mean you're wrong. But rather than her just stop talking about her dead partner, she probably needs counseling. But honestly, you don't have to be there for it. You deserve a partner who appreciates you, and don't compare you to others.She might be a good person, but she hasn't been a good partner to you. I don't think she's ready for a relationship with another person.
n9q8k4,Even if this guy was alive she should not be comparing you to him.  To compare you to a dead person, who was likely not as perfect as she makes him out to be, is completely out of bounds.It sounds like part of her never dealt with the grief of losing him and she idolizes this dead lover.  I'm sure he had his faults, too.A productive conversation starts with her agreeing to stop using him as a comparison.  Whether you want her to be introspective about her feelings for this late boyfriend or not will be up to you.
n9q8k4,There are three people in this relationship, OP, but only you get to decide if you are willing to be part of that.She is not ready to move on. I'm sorry, but she isn't. Her comparing the two of you OUT LOUD to your face during a normal conversation is a very big red flag. I hope she is in therapy, because she needs it badly if she feels the need to bring him up so often.I get that she is grieving, but she is so focused on her love and admiration for him, she isn't focusing on developing a relationship with you.You talking about being stressed was absolutely an inappropriate time to float about what a wonderful personality her ex had. She has issues and she needs to resolve them, because the vast majority of people would not tolerate constantly living in the shadow of an ex.
n9q8k4,It‚Äôs not as though she is just talking about him, she‚Äôs using him as a means to put you down, something that is never ok - whether he is dead or alive.You need to enforce your boundaries and whilst it‚Äôs not the case that she should never mention him or forget about him, she needs to stop putting you down or comparing you unfavourably to him.You have not messed up. Don‚Äôt apologise for her bad actions, you‚Äôll only end up validating her if you do.
n9q8k4,I think you are right and she‚Äôs wrongHer bringing up an OLD BF from years ago is just plain mean and hurtful.Why would comparing you to anyone ever be the correct thing for her to do???Personally if she can‚Äôt be with YOU and wants to compare you to a fantasy then you are better off without her.She needs to apologize to you NOT vice versa.My advice ‚Äî dont run after her.  Let her apologize and come to you.
n9q8k4,Absolutely do not apologize for something that doesn‚Äôt warrant an apology. Doing so will reinforce her behavior that comparing Op constantly is Ok, which it is not.
n9q8k4,She needs some grief counseling for closure she‚Äôs never had.She‚Äôs not in the wrong for missing him or talking about him, but she is in the wrong for constantly comparing your relationship against theirs and you and him as people.It is totally fine for you to put these boundaries up, but it sounds like she won‚Äôt respond well since she‚Äôs not processed these things like she should have.
n9q8k4,Omg OP I wish I could give you a hug because you genuinely seem like a good person. I am a highly anxious person too and my bf is not. He would never try and mould me into something I am not. She‚Äôs lacking understanding and honestly has not processed her grief. Her comparing him to you is making you feel lesser as a person and that‚Äôs totally unfair. You need to have a conversation with her and push her to get therapy to deal with her grief. If things don‚Äôt improve, I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôve gotta let her go. You deserve to feel upmost love in your relationship without her deceased ex hanging over you.
n9q8k4,You didn‚Äôt mess up, she did. I would apologize about the way it came out, but make it clear you‚Äôre not sorry about the content of what was said and you need to have a discussion.Boundary time!Absolutely no comparisons, that‚Äôs literally cruel. If she makes any excuses, then she‚Äôs simply not far along enough in her grieving to be with you. It sucks but as much as it will always be a part of her, she needs to learn to live in a healthier way.But you should mention times you are ok with him being brought up: ex. If we are at a place that reminds you of him, that‚Äôs a reasonable time to make a comment.This is really up to her if she is able to meet your needs with her current mental health but there‚Äôs no way you could continue with the way it‚Äôs going.
n9q8k4,I agree with the others, you haven‚Äôt done anything wrong. You need to be getting what you need out of the relationship for it to work and be happy. You cannot live with the ghost of someone else hanging over you and being compared to someone else, it isn‚Äôt fair and will grow into resentment.I think your girlfriend would benefit from speaking to someone.You deserve someone who can celebrate your success and be an equal partner to you.
n9q8k4,Your only "screw up", if you can call it that, was to address it during an already emotional moment. This should've been a planned conversation.The dead guy is on a pedestal. This happens when people die, especially young and in traumatic circumstances. He wasn't, of course, this perfect human being in life, but he is in death. And it's a horrible thing that your gf is doing, negatively comparing you to this perfect phantom every time you're a little bit down.She is probably not doing it on purpose to make you feel bad, but her intent doesn't matter that much. It's corrosive to your relationship, and she has to stop.
n9q8k4,You asked for the wedding thing here. Asking her to not talk about him at all. Asking her to not compare you to him is pretty important. Right now she's being manipulative with his memory, whether she means to our not.
n9q8k4,It‚Äôs hard to compete w the ghost in your relationship. Has she had counseling? I‚Äôm not sure I could stay w someone who compared me to the deceased every day. It‚Äôs one thing to recall a memory, but she seems to be actively comparing you and her deceased former bf and you always come up short. Was there enough time btw his death and your relationship? Either way, not cool. Oh and you didn‚Äôt ruin the night, she did.
n9q8k4,He has been sensitive for years. At a certain point, people don‚Äôt deserve your sensitivity. What he did 100% ok and correct to do. It sucks that asking her to be reasonable and not compare him to an ex on a constant basis is hurtful to her, but she needs to deal with that hurt, not be shielded from it. She is inflicting far more hurt than he is, and he is not even responsible for it.
laksa7,She's misplacing her anger. She should be upset about her boyfriend not being what she wants him to be, should have broken up with that guy when it became evident they wanted different things, but instead is settling for an overgrown 12 year old.Give her time. If she's really your friend, she will reach out eventually.Don't check in on her, just ignore her behavior. She's probably wanting the attention, because based on who she's dating, she herself is probably not as grown up as she might seem. I know it sucks to lose your bestie, but in this case, you getting engaged might be forcing her to examine her life.
laksa7,She's misplacing her anger.It's probably safer, in her mind, to be mad at OP.  OP is a good friend who has shown her empathy, kindness, and friendship.  Maybe in the back of Molly's mind, she feels like this relationship can survive this type of poor behavior.  But if she were to get mad at BF he'd probably be horrible to her, make her feel like garbage and punish her and make her grovel for daring to be mad.  Because he's a totally asshole.  Deep down, Molly knows it.OP isn't an asshole and even if she gets mad at Molly's misplaced anger, she's unlikely to lash out and punish Molly for it.  In fact, OP is doing the opposite by trying to continue the friendship despite Molly being a bad friend.  OP is safe.  Boyfriend is obviously not a safe space.I feel bad for Molly and OP.  I agree that OP needs to stop pushing and just let it alone and wait for Molly to reach out.  There is nothing she can do at the moment and pinging Molly is just sort of reinforcing the misplaced anger.
laksa7,Thanks for this, I really appreciate it. It will be hard but I think you‚Äôre right about her reaching out if we really are friends.
laksa7,Molly needs to grow up.  Why in god's name was she having YOU send HER partner pictures of rings and pinterest boards?  Perhaps, she should have given you a card to send to Tony asking, "Do you want to marry me? [   ] Yes [   ] No"Now, she's being passive aggressive about her jealousy.  You talk about not being able to understand why Molly wants Tony in her life.  But, it seems equally confusing why you want Molly in your life.  She's an immature drama queen.  Find a new bestie.
laksa7,I don‚Äôt have many friends, and Molly was a great friend to me for 99% of our friendship. So when she asked me to do silly things like send Tony wedding stuff I just thought whatever, sure, fine.Letting go of her is so hard. I‚Äôm thankful I posted this thought because everyone‚Äôs input lining up with what Noah has expressed and what was lurking in the back of my mind has been validated by many kind strangers.
laksa7,I had a friend that was like this, her boyfriend broke up with her then she went off on a tangent trying to get me to break up with my boyfriend at the time telling me everything that was wrong with him so that way she wouldn‚Äôt be the only one that was alone. When I wouldn‚Äôt break up with him she stopped talking to me for years, never even contacted me when I was in the ICU dying. She only ever contacted me again when he and I broke up. Some people just can‚Äôt stand to see others happy, even if it‚Äôs people they claim to love and care about.
laksa7,I‚Äôm really sorry that happened to you, I hope you‚Äôre in a better place emotionally and health wise now. Thank you for your input. It‚Äôs nice to hear from someone who has been through this too!
laksa7,It sounds like there is not really much else you can do. She‚Äôs having a super immature and selfish response for sure. It may be understandable that she‚Äôs upset, or jealous. It‚Äôs not however understandable that she‚Äôd be so angry with you that she needs to cut you out of her life. She‚Äôs obviously trying to punish you and you continuing to reach out and apologize is probably giving her some kind of sick pleasure that she know she‚Äôs hurting you. Relationships aren‚Äôt competitions. She can come back to you whenever she‚Äôs ready but she sounds like she is not a good friend, tbh. She will owe you a serious apology if she ever smartens up. For whatever it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôm sorry you are being hurt in this way <3
laksa7,I appreciate you <3
laksa7,Do not - I repeat do not hire Tony as the wedding singer!
laksa7,This made me laugh, thank you!
laksa7,Listen to your fianc√©'s advice. If Molly is truly the good friend you believe her to be, she will eventually reach out and apologize for distancing herself. If not, well, then you will know she is not the friend you thought her to be. Yes, undoubtedly her feelings about her own relationship and Tony not committing are causing her grief, but it is not fair to take out her anger on you.However, two months is an awfully long time to have zero contact over this and, at this point, you should begin the process of accepting that Molly is no longer your friend. A week or two of no contact? Sure, that would be somewhat understandable, but two months? It is time to question the friendship. There's a big difference between ZERO contact and her saying to you "hey, I need some distance right now while I process my feelings."
laksa7,This comment hurt me, but you‚Äôre right. I guess because we haven‚Äôt actually seen each other in person for so long because of the lockdown two months didn‚Äôt really feel like THAT much but I know it actually is.
laksa7,Thats really rough, to have your best friend lose sight of the beautiful friendship you both built. My sister had a similar situation. What she found to work was: she sent a very clear text, saying how she appreciated this friend, and wanted to continue to have a relationship. That she understood if said person needed some time, but that some sort of reply and communication was necessary. That if no reply is sent, the assumption is that space is needed now, and that my sister will no longer reach out. Hope this is helpful. You care about your friend, but she seems unable to get out of her own reactive place to see you. Congratulations and best of luck. Also if she threatened to kill you... stay safe, stay aware.
laksa7,Thank you so much!
laksa7,Stop reaching out.  Your fiance is correct.
laksa7,Molly is clearly not an Angel of a human being as you assumed
laksa7,I‚Äôm realizing that since I posted this. It‚Äôs hard for me to see her in a different light but I am now.
laksa7,So her bf wanted a woman act like his mommy and do everything for him but also have sex. And shes jealous and bitter that shes wasted 10+ years on her life on a loser wholl never commit and in the time shes knows you, youve met a great guys, moved in together, and gotten engaged. Prepare that shell never get over her bitterness and jealously.
laksa7,Since I can't seem to reply to the newest post, I'll put it here - I'm sorry your friend is being shitty, and I think it's good you're accepting that it has to be over between you two.I also wanna say that, considering Tony, as a 28 year old man started dating Molly as a 19 year old teenage girl, I sympathize that he has likely seriously damaged how she thinks relationships should be. Her developing years as an adult have all gone to this significantly older man who has never once treated her with the respect she deserves. Seeing someone else's actually healthy relationship is understandably frustrating as it makes her question everything Tony has taught her. However, that's not your problem to fix. If him being rude to you when you sent him her pictures board (let alone the fact that she felt she needed to to through you instead of just showing him herself) wasn't enough to make her see how shitty of a man she's with, nothing will. And unfortunately that's how a lot of these relationships where an older person grooms a younger person goes. Especially if he has influence over her (being in a popular band).At the end of the day, Molly needs therapy. She needs to see her boyfriend for who he actually is, and not who she wants him to be. She has to accept that what she is doing is settling, while what you are doing is living, and you're allowed to be happy even if she isn't. Again, that is all stuff she'll need to learn on her own. It's just unfortunate that the first relationship that made her question hers happened so late into the toxic relationship. It's scary to leave.Anyway, I only say this because it helps me to understand the other person's perspective. Maybe appreciating that her toxicity stems from deeper than what she's showing here, and a lot of it comes from having been a vulnerable teenager when she was scooped up by her asshole boyfriend, will help you feel less like the reason she's upset.I'm really happy for you and your fianc√© tho, I wish you both the best! Losing a best friend is tough, but it sounds like your real best friend is the one who you're gonna marry.
nvzvmr,What do you think he believes he gains if he makes you think he's distraught about this? A few possibilities:He wants to evoke sympathy in order to hurt youHe wants to evoke sympathy to provoke you comforting him and dropping your previous demandHe wants to maintain the appearance that he is the victim here for both himself and others
nvzvmr,Yeah, I‚Äôm going with option #3.  He really wants to act like the good guy/victim in all this.
nvzvmr,It seems like he was trying to make you feel guilty by dropping hints that he was unwell and might harm himself. Probably because he's annoyed that you wouldn't go along with what he wanted. Maybe he's unable to see himself as being at fault in anyway, so he has to make you the 'bad' person and him the one who is so upset.You did the right thing. I think you should draw a line under it, move on and completely cut contact with him everywhere.
nvzvmr,Yes, I agree. He wanted her to give in to what he wanted. He thought breaking up with her would make her desperate not to lose him and willing to give him whatever he wanted, but it backfired because OP accepted the breakup.  Do Not go back to him OP.
nvzvmr,Maybe he's unable to see himself being at fault in any wayOh I think he definitely knows he's at fault. He just doesn't give a shit what's right or wrong and wants things his way, and somehow he thought this would make her change her mind about the boundaries and beg him not to leave her lmao
nvzvmr,Because he‚Äôs a manipulative asshat, who can‚Äôt believe you walked away from him. He was certain when he ended things, you‚Äôd beg him to reconsider. When you didn‚Äôt, he tried the bullshit tears and storyline for sympathy.His FWB can deal with his narcissism. If he wants sympathy from you, tell him he can find it in the dictionary between shit and syphilis.
nvzvmr,Manipulative for sure and probably a cheater. This guy reminds me so much of my ex. He was a cheater and a liar and when I gave him an opportunity to be transparent about whether or not he upheld his promises (after I caught him lying, and by showing me his phone), he said he would not and broke up with me. I decided right then and there he‚Äôs trash so accepted the break up as final. He inevitably came crying for me to take him back the very next day. It was obvious what he was trying to do: tried to keep me tethered to a relationship with him while he gets to do whatever he wants with the female friend he cheated on me with.OP‚Äôs ex is definitely a lying cheat and thinks he‚Äôs slick. Everyone can see right through him as evident by all the responses here.
nvzvmr,Dam thats savage! I love this comment.
nvzvmr,Manipulative sadboi yikes
nvzvmr,Ahahah love that last sentence, dayum sassy
nvzvmr,This. Textbook victim/covert narcissist
nvzvmr,"between shit and syphilis"Fucking brilliant and I officially love you
nvzvmr,Let me tell you a little story about how my roommate was dumped once in college:She was dating an actor for a few months and he came over to our apartment to dump her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs me. We‚Äôre just not in the same place right now, blah blah blah‚Äù. They were sitting on her bed and they were both crying and all that when she noticed he wasn‚Äôt actually looking at her... he was watching himself dump her in the mirror that was behind her. He was actually trying out different sad faces!  In that instant she realized how fake he was and how self-centered he had been the whole time. She stopped crying and told him to get out, and was glad the relationship was over.Good riddance.
nvzvmr,Good Lord she dodged a bullet.
nvzvmr,Damn that is fucked up. And of course it would be an actor lol
nvzvmr,Holy crap that is really indicative of a narcissist or honestly a straight-up sociopath! They have to fake emotions because they don't feel them like normal people do. I'm so glad she dodged that bullet. I'm so glad she saw that and was glad to be rid of him.
nvzvmr,This is a funny but sad story.
nvzvmr,Wow how embarrassing for him!
nvzvmr,So you feel bad and agree to get back together with him without him getting rid of his side peice
nvzvmr,OP is the side piece, me thinks.
hnaefd,He's never made me feel special really on my birthday or done anything for Valentine's DayHe was enraged and I was hysterically cryingHe got really offended by this and started screaming at mehe texted his parents and told them that I was mad at themI know you're asking prediminatinly about the proposal, bu these items really stood out to me. This guy doesn't sound like he has your back.And when we get to the proposal...I felt like I had to tell him my feelings about not being engaged in that moment, and the words, "why aren't we married," just seemed to escape my lips. ... He said almost immediately in defense, "We can get married," but the conversation deteriorated into a huge fight from there. He said that I robbed him of the opportunity to genuinely ask me, but also confessed that he had no intention of asking me this year at all. He said that we will never have that beautiful moment now. He said that I can never be sure that it is genuine now, because I had to force things to happen, instead of letting them happen organically.What the fuck?Talking about marriage, about timelines, and about the frustration of not being proposed to yet (all conversations I had with my fiance over the years before we were engaged) does not detract from the moment when it happens. It's absolutely terrible that your partner used the conversation, about your disappointment at not being engaged yet and how it impacted your feelings and sense of self, as an opportunity to berate you and blame you for ruining something that didn't have to be ruined.Honestly, I think his response indicates a lot of really terrible qualities - he acts as though you're not allowed to have agency in your own life, as though you have to sit patiently (for 11+ years) and wait for your "present" and never ask about it because asking ruins the "surprise". Worse, he admits he had no intention of proposing to you this year and accuses you of "forcing things to happen"...this doesn't sound like a man who has any interest or plan to marry you at all. Someone who wants to marry you and is ready to marry you wouldn't accuse you of "forcing" things, simply for asking why you're not engaged after 11 years.Everything else that follows just makes the situation worse. No argument should ever warrant being screamed at, no matter what you said. I'm not convinced your "fiance" ever told his parents about your engagement in the first place. Even if he did, him throwing you under the bus to his parents is a terrible thing for a partner to do.This guy doesn't sound like a good guy for you. He doesn't sound like a good guy at all.
hnaefd,This stuck out to me too.OP, so much of your story sounds similar to my relationship. I haven‚Äôt been with my BF as long as you have, but the early difficulties needing to be overcoming, the delay in actually saying I love you, the need to feel romanced and not wanting to have to push for what you want: all of that struck home to me. Honestly, your story is my worst fear because I‚Äôm at the point where I feel I need to bring up they ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt we engaged‚Äù question too.Another commenter mentioned that part of your problem is about time. One thing I‚Äôve learned is that there‚Äôs no true timeline for relationships if they‚Äôre genuine and you feel happy and validated in them. While I can only go off what you‚Äôve written here, the way your bf reacted to a reasonable question is concerning. You should be able to have these discussions without them devolving as this one did. And the way he turned the blame on you for robbing him of the moment that he wasn‚Äôt even actively planning for is also a üö©. At this point you seem to be feeling a lot of frustration and resentment, which I think you‚Äôre right to be feeling. Is this really the foundation you want to build the rest of your life on? If you‚Äôre 10000% convinced that you‚Äôre in this for the long haul, you might want to try couples therapy to try to have someone with outside perspective to mediate the conversations that you two really need to have before getting married.
hnaefd,That bit stuck out to me too. He just sounds so manipulative, and it makes me wonder what he‚Äôs like the rest of the time.There is no way that after 11 years this guy hasn‚Äôt noticed that OP wants reassurance and security, to have a fuss made of her and to feel special, but for some reason he doesn‚Äôt seem to care.OP, I understand it has been 11 years and you love him, but I strongly urge you to reconsider this relationship. I know we‚Äôre only seeing a snippet of your relationship, but it sounds like what you need most from him, is something you‚Äôre not getting. Don‚Äôt settle for someone just because it‚Äôs a comfortable option.
hnaefd,Yes. These stuck out to me too. I‚Äôm concerned that he was enraged that you wanted to marry him? Does he appreciate how lucky he is?Call off the engagement, at least, until you‚Äôve been to couples‚Äô counselling. This dude is not hearing you.This need you have to feel loved, to feel special, that‚Äôs a basic human need- you‚Äôre meeting it for him, but he is not meeting it for you. Meeting that for you has to be baseline in someone you marry. It‚Äôs not hard to do something for your birthday, for Valentine‚Äôs Day, when you get a promotion. It‚Äôs not hard to be enthusiastic about getting engaged to you!I understand that this is super emotional for you, and I‚Äôve been there. Oh god yes. Nothing like a painful proposal with someone who leaves you feeling ashamed and worthless sometimes. But you deserve better. So much better.

hnaefd,I can't believe I had to scroll this far down to see this!! This dude is not emotionally ready for a relationship, much less marriage. Yikes
hnaefd,This was a fantastic comment. (I should've scrolled down further before I wrote my own!) I hope OP sees it.
hnaefd,This was my response as well. I totally get how OP feels. Because of upbringing/insecurities, I have this overwhelming need to know that someone wants ME. And clearly loves and wants and is EXCITED about being with me. So when my now husband was taking his time in the progression of our relationship (he was more recently divorced than I was), my view of our relationship took a beating. I understood logically but emotionally it hurt. It was really the one thing that caused me to question us. So I get it. But here‚Äôs the key difference - when I talked with my then bf, he understood and never once berated me or tried to make me feel guilty about how I was feeling. As I said to him, it‚Äôs okay if you want something differently, totally cool with that, but let me know so when can proceed accordingly. OP‚Äôs guy seems so so so immature and has qualities that I would not want in a lifetime partner. His response is so telling.
hnaefd,He definitely doesn‚Äôt sound like a good guy but OP really needs to learn to communicate. I don‚Äôt think this relationship will work at all.
hnaefd,These are the exact parts that got me too
hnaefd,Yea I'm not trying to say whether to leave or stay in this relationship but I don't know if I could get over this or should be expected. I dated a guy like this for two years and didn't really how much resentment I held in.Dating a different guy now who is so loving and it's so different.
hnaefd,I know you've invested a lot of time into this, and I don't expect you to shut your feelings on and off like a light switch and immediately pack up and leave....But i wouldn't want to get married to someone I had to drag to the altar. If he was interested in marriage, he would have made it happen.
hnaefd,I wouldn‚Äôt want to be with any man who tried to twist the situation. ‚ÄúYou brought up marriage, you‚Äôre trying to force my hand! This is all your fault! Now if we don‚Äôt get married, it‚Äôs because you can‚Äôt let it happen ‚Äúorganically‚Äù and have to actually talk about your feelings!‚ÄùI‚Äôve met and dated guys like that. When they say ‚Äúlet things happen organically‚Äù, they really mean ‚ÄúI never plan to do it until I receive pressure to do it and then it‚Äôs kicking and screaming‚ÄùHe‚Äôs really thrown her under the bus, too, by telling his parents she‚Äôs upset and making her look like a bad person.
hnaefd,Researchers have found that people cling on to lacklustre relationships because of the ‚Äúsunk cost fallacy‚Äù and a fear of wasting time. ... ‚ÄúInvestments in terms of time, effort, and money make individuals more prone to stay and invest in a relationship in which they are unhappy,‚Äù the authors wrote in the study.
hnaefd,This.And my first thought about her partners parents would be questioning why they didn‚Äôt react the same as little brother. Could it be that they knew he had zero interest in marrying OP? Or did he make it sound like OP forced him into proposing and when he told his parents he wasn‚Äôt relaying good news as much as he was complaining that it happened?Everything about this would make me feel like shit and I‚Äôd never be able to get past the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù of thinking that he only proposed because OP made it an issue.
hnaefd,This is heartbreaking. More than anything, I wish you could‚Äôve posted here 5 years ago.11 years is too long, and it seems he wasn‚Äôt entirely on the same page as you even with the talk of married life and kids. Somewhere after the first couple years, he realized you aren‚Äôt going anywhere and therefore didn‚Äôt feel the need to ask you to marry him. Remember: you are the one that pursued him.His brother actively planned for a proposal, and worked with the parents to make it happen. Congratulations to them, it‚Äôs painful to admit but his brother‚Äôs effort deserved the joy of a surprise proposal. Your boyfriend‚Äôs blas√© response of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just get married then‚Äù is painstakingly clear.The in-laws are likely conflicted about how to even converse with you two. You did have to force it out of him, and there wasn‚Äôt even a ring involved.I need to clarify that it is very hard to be unbiased reading this because of the length of time you two have been together.And it‚Äôs because of that long history, you absolutely deserve to have a joyful proposal. I hope you find the love and understanding you deserve.
hnaefd,The timing for the in-laws probably plays a part in their response too. Everyone in the family knew the younger brother was about to propose and suddenly his older brother has sprung a surprise proposal. It would probably come off looking like the OP's fiance was trying to upstage his younger brother.
hnaefd,I agree about his parents reaction.  It may well be that they had a feeling he wasn't ready for marriage (either with OP specifically or women in general) and are surprised but slightly uneasy about the sudden proposal.  But even so they should have congratulated OP.  After all, she loves their son and wants to give them grandchildren.
hnaefd,And the worst part is I guaran-goddamn-tee he‚Äôll be engaged to the next girl in less than a year.
mho7jd,I would just say that in your initial post you commented that you don‚Äôt know about his finances and whether he was saving for a ring. But - money is one of the number ones issues in relationships and marriage. Are you guys actually ready for marriage? Did you talk religion, houses, children (how you‚Äôd raise them, if you want any etc) and all the other big stuff?What is it that changed in two days that he was able to talk about it?I guess all I‚Äôm saying is that I‚Äôd be cautious and talk a lot more about next steps
mho7jd,Agree! Finances should be the first thing talked about before getting engaged. Are you going to share finances ? Separate finances ? And as said what about kids? Where do you guys want to live long term? There‚Äôs so much to talk about before getting married and he was very quick to say okay! Let‚Äôs go shopping. Ask more questions.
mho7jd,this, so much.I've had people get angry with me for me saying it was important to talk kids, politics, and religion with your significant other, because "that's personal!" I assume you have the secks, my friends; close relationships are personal, and it's a lot easier to talk things out before you're married than when you find out you have very opposing viewpoints after the fact.Edit: and finances. Financial stress makes up a significant percentage of causes of divorce.
mho7jd,They also don‚Äôt seem to live together which is kinda crazy for an engagement.
mho7jd,I was surprised to hear that as well. Also that they don‚Äôt live together (yet). I would never marry someone that I haven‚Äôt lived with, because it is such a huge difference. Even when you are at one persons place all the time, it is not the same as living together.
mho7jd,Did you get your panorama?
mho7jd,Asking the important questions!
mho7jd,What‚Äôs the difference between agreeing to get engaged and getting engaged? The pomp and circumstance?
mho7jd,Financially investing I guess. The ring itself.
mho7jd,I think it's a conversation starter on a bunch of the things you need to discuss and agree on before marriage. My spouse and I had a convo of "yes we want to be together forever" and started talking about marriage and what we thought that would look like for months before they proposed.
mho7jd,I think it makes sense if you consider ‚Äúengagement‚Äù to be the socially recognized time of wedding planning. In some ways, there‚Äôs private engagement (when you have the conversation that you want to get married) and public engagement (when you tell everyone else you‚Äôre going to get married).We‚Äôre social creatures, and still care about social ritual, so it makes sense that announcing to your friends and family the desire to make things official is a big deal!
mho7jd,I think every couple who wants to get married should be on the same page about it, it should absolutely be a conversation before anyone proposes. IME for myself and my friends, everyone knew the engagement was coming but the specifics of the proposal were the surprise part.
mho7jd,Personally, my partner and I have agreed to get engaged, but have not gone ring shopping yet. He is planning to officially propose after lockdowns end in our area.For me, this is an opportunity to have a romantic gesture associated with stepping up our commitment. When we first got together it was just as friends with benefits and there wasn't a romantic moment, we just kind of realized we had stopped being interested in other people and discussed "officially" being monogamous.We also both want a single ring that we will wear for engagement and marriage, so this is a step that will take us from no visible indications of our commitment, to having rings that clearly signal we are a couple. For us, this will not change between engagement and the marriage, so the proposal feels like a bigger step.TLDR: Discussing engagement is a vital conversation you should have whether you want a proposal or not. Getting engaged is an opportunity to create a special memory.
mho7jd,I've never understood this either hahah.
mho7jd,When you actually get engaged, you make it Facebook official so it's more meaningful than just agreeing to get married.
mho7jd,A fancy proposal and/or a picture of someone down on one knee.
mho7jd,Being engaged is a promise to marry.  So I wonder if this yet another delaying tactic?
k9c84u,If you want to be so much like my ex, I will just break up with you too.
k9c84u,Hey, um, so, you mention that your relationship was "close to perfect" before this, but considering "this" started nearly a year ago, this new dynamic characterizes almost half of your two years together. Sounds a lot like he had on a honeymoon period mask and has now revealed his true colors. Sorry, but I don't think "getting your bf to stop hanging out with your ex" solves your problem.Your current boyfriend has serious issues and is demonstrating a willingness to try to build himself up by tearing you down. He also is apparently pretty manipulative and controlling. So many red flags:He's managed to make you rethink ever saying no to him because you're trying to avoid a manufactured fight in which he compares himself to your ex.He sulks to get his way.He guilts you to get his way by saying you probably wouldn't say no to your ex.Passive aggressive, etc.... It appears he's testing your boundaries to figure out what emotional manipulation he can apply to get his way.He's "punishing" you by weaponizing things you say while discussing your relationship with him and telling them to others to shame you and make you less likely to advocate for yourself later.Kind of sounds like he's trying to make you jealous to prove you love him more (possibly stemming from insecurity, but could be more malintentioned than that)? Constant testing of affection is not a great strategy for longevity....He's insincere. The two-faced thing he has going on with snide comments about how nice your ex was, and making fun of the opportunities/connections your ex had in his career at the same time as he's trying to build a relationship with him (to leverage his career connections?) is definitely going to catch up with him.....The way you describe it, it's deeply creepy how he manipulated his way into your ex's friend circle.I'm sure you want back the boyfriend you thought you had prior to this revelation, but he probably doesn't exist. This is who you're dating. Even if you get him to stop hanging out with your ex, he's demonstrated how he interacts in relationships once he's made it to the comfort level. He will use what he learned through this period to get you to think it's too much of an inconvenience to stick up for yourself in other ways. Please don't buy into the sunk cost fallacy... you've got too much of your life still ahead of you for that.Don't take my word for it though. I highly recommend you read Lundy Bancroft's "Why Does He Do That?" I think you'll recognize your boyfriend.
k9c84u,All of this. I think we all want to read the update where you have kicked his ass to the curb, and happily ridden off into the sunset without him. Personally, I would love the version of this where he's talking about how much you prefer your ex, and you say, "You're right. I'm going back to him." (Do that in public, though. I don't trust him not to react very badly).
k9c84u,Red flags all around. It sounds like your guy is deeply insecure and channeling that insecurity into loathing.  He's already taking it out on you. Manipulating you, pressuring you in the bedroom, even attempting to turn your seemingly amicable ex on you?? He's pushing your boundaries. And his demands are impossible. Nothing you do will fix his insecurity, and so he will continue to lash out and demean you. I know because I have been there.This relationship sounds nothing "close to perfect." I sincerely hope you distance yourself from him and get some perspective. Best of luck.
k9c84u,To be honest this sounds frightening.
k9c84u,Your boyfriend is clearly going through some things that he's not prepared to discuss with you like an adult, so I'd take this to a couples' counselor.If your boyfriend won't go? Dump him. You deserve so much better than this.
k9c84u,The sex thing is a huge red flag, if someone is manipulating you into having sex by making you feel bad, you need to take care of yourself and leave this relationship, maybe they'll end up dating each other lol
k9c84u,Your boyfriend is deeply insecure to the point of mental illness. I have been the boyfriend in this situation. I would suggest you sit him down and suggest he go to therapy, because the issue is with him and his insecurities, not you. Breaking up could also be an option to consider as it is not your job to help him deal with his insecurities.
k9c84u,I dunno man, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd even want to date someone who reached this level of stalker obsession with my ex. Maybe it‚Äôs for the best to just end things, he clearly needs professional help for his insecurities. I don‚Äôt think a relationship is healthy for him right now.
k9c84u,He's acting out based on his own insecurities and it's obviously gotten deep. You need to establish a boundary with it and reassure him you love him for being him, not for being like your ex... Who you're no longer with for a reason.
k9c84u,he already turned into a monster.  It's like he wants to be him or something, then murder him on a boat trip.
k9c84u,Sounds like his mindset of your ex is like "no wonder OP dated him, look at him, he's all these great things!" And he's trying to hang out with him because he sees a lot of what he strives to be, thus also kind of seeing him as a role model at the same time.If I say no to anything (including sex) he comments about how he bets I wouldn‚Äôt say no if my ex was the one asking.He's clearly jealous of your ex yet still forgets that an ex is an ex for a reason. Maybe sit down and explain to him why you and your ex even broke up
k9c84u,Tell him he has to cut contact with your ex and never mention him again or you will leave him.
k9c84u,Ugh. This guy sounds scary. He sounds manipulative and like he‚Äôs lying to you and himself. I would get out in a hurry if I were you. I don‚Äôt even care what bizarre motives he has, they definitely aren‚Äôt healthy.
k9c84u,Oh, hun. No, this isn‚Äôt healthy. I‚Äôm totally having flashbacks of the movie Single White Female. If he‚Äôs not responding to you when you confront him, then I think you should give him the ultimatum‚Äîyou or your ex-boyfriend. If he chooses you, hard boundaries need to be implemented with the first being he can‚Äôt be friends with your ex. SMH. How would he feel about being besties with his exs? He would definitely not like it so I don‚Äôt understand why he can‚Äôt understand that.
k9c84u,Sounds like your bf is mentally ill and has managed to hide his true self. 2 years might sound like alot but you never know someone's true colors.Based on your post, he's insanely insecure and trying to compensate by being your ex.
k9c84u,I just read your update, your ex sounded like an obsessed psycho. If he's still harassing you with new numbers I would begin to feel very concerned about him stalking you. Begin documenting everything and every time he contacts you so that if you need a restraining order in the future, you've got proof to back you up
k9c84u,This isn‚Äôt them meeting and hitting it off, though. He forced his way into the ex‚Äôs social circle and it doesn‚Äôt sound like the guy reciprocates that. If the current partner of someone I used to date started talking to me all the time and gossiping about my ex to me, I would be supremely uncomfortable.I‚Äôm all for being friends with exes. My partner and I both have people in our social circles that we used to date... but this isn‚Äôt the same.
hm1wdi,Maybe you are a great spouse and she isn't. IMO you got married far too young and now you are learning why that isn't wise. Youve made it pretty clear that she's not interested in fixing things so is this effort on your part really worth it? She doesn't love you bro, find someone who does.
hm1wdi,Thanks for the comment. Everyone has helped open my eyes to issues going on in my marriage. Definitely have some decisions to make.
hm1wdi,You are 26 years old. Get the hell out of this marriage and go be happy, you've got your whole life ahead of you - don't waste it trying to make things work with someone who isn't in live with you, doesn't want to be intimate with you and seems to have been manipulating you since before you even married her.
hm1wdi,Thank you for your comment. It definitely helps give me perspective to how things haven‚Äôt been right. Now just to move forward from here.
hm1wdi,Honestly, I think this is a wife problem, not a you problem. I'd strongly suggest marriage counseling it may help delve a bit deeper into what and why your wife is feeling the way she is in a neutral environment. It seems like you are doing what she has asked and what you can to try and get the relationship on track but I think professional help would be advantageous.
hm1wdi,I'd strongly suggest dumping her.This was a bait and switch and her happiness isn't your problem.She isn't a good partner.and please don't have kids with her.
hm1wdi,Thank you! I will definitely try to move to that step. Hopefully my wife will be onboard.
hm1wdi,I don't think marriage counselling is a good idea, most likely they are gonna make him look like he's the one causing the problems. All it's going to reinforce is that he's not tending to her needs enough or doing everything he can to fix the marriage when in fact he is going above and beyond in this case and in reality she is the problem. I'm not sure where he is from but i feel he shouldn't of married her the moment the intimacy took a nose dive. Massive redflag there, especially when it was after they got engaged. And that flimsy excuse of maybe her hormones aren't the same as when she was younger is another redflag, unfortunately if OP ends up divorcing she's going to go with half, what has he got prepared for that outcome?
hm1wdi,There's a lot to unpack here man. I'm sorry you're going through this. It's tough. I've been where you are, but I've spent most of my relationship working because my spouse doesn't want to work "because it is stealing her motherhood" or if she gets a job it doesn't last long and it's generally minimum wage work. And, unlike you guys, we have doesn't years and years fighting over the same old garbage. It's exhausting. I, like you, feel like I'm pulling most of the weight because my wife basically does the minimum house work to keep us going. A load of laundry, cook a meal, do the dishes as needed, and I've learned to deal with it or do it myself. A couple of years ago I started to disconnect from her. I wanted a divorce, but she convinced me to stay. She got a job- complained about it constantly- and I started to do even more housework, while going back to school, and working two jobs. Still wasn't enough. She had an affair. Can you believe that crap? Anyway, we are still together, still fighting about the same old crap. But I had an epiphany the other day, and to be frank it sounds like your wife may have the same problem. The problem isn't you, it's her. There's a void in her that can't be fixed by you because your not the problem. You have done more for her than she has for you and she still finds a problem with you. Unfortunately though, that puts you in a quandary. You have to answer the question, do you want to help figure it out or do you want to go?If your reaching out here, I'd venture to say you want to keep going. I hope you do. I don't regret any time I've spent trying to make it work with my wife. You didn't get into marriage because you thought it was just for a few years, you know? Relationships aren't easy and always, always, one party is pulling more weight than the other. But, when it gets skewed the way yours has something needs to be done. Marriage books aren't going to solve this, she needs counseling. Be supportive of her going individually and with you as well. But encourage her to go no matter what. It may be difficult. Hell, it will definitely be difficult, but it's worth it. Also, be prepared to deal with the fact that you can't fix her and if she's unwilling to do anything about it than your marriage will likely fail. But, comfort yourself with the fact you did all you could and don't give up easily. Anybody you value high enough to marry is worth going through hell for. I wish you the best man.
hm1wdi,Wow, thank you for your comment. Definitely helped me a lot. Sorry to hear you‚Äôre going through the same thing. You had some great insight and advise so I hope you‚Äôre following that as well.
hm1wdi,I‚Äôm not going to lie, it sounds like you have done everything you can, except encourage your wife to step up to the plate. She sounds like there‚Äôre is something very wrong with her and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing her to put in so little effort and also be uninterested in you. Maybe depression? I don‚Äôt know. But the next step is couples‚Äô therapy for you both and individual for her.
hm1wdi,You have a golden opportunity to get out now relatively easily (no kids).  Why would you want to spend a single minute with somebody who doesn't want to be with you?
hm1wdi,It sounds like she is not being really honest with you about what's wrong, and it's possible she doesn't even know herself. I think she should get individual therapy (in addition to couples counseling) so that she can work through her own feelings so that she can share them with you. The way she is treating you is really unfair, I think.
hm1wdi,Thank you for your comment. I definitely have a lot to consider. Divorce is definitely something I want to pursue last, but you‚Äôve definitely helped me see that things are not right here.
hm1wdi,Please be wary of the responses that have turned your wife into a manipulator out for your joint property or accuse her of weaponizing sex. There are several factors that can affect intimacy/sex drive (depression, anxiety/stress, past sexual trauma, self-esteem issues).Apart from intimacy, though, it does not seem like she is putting in the effort that you are. As many are saying, I would seek professional counseling to sort this out straight away. Self-help books, in my opinion, are not the answer for you two as they won‚Äôt address the root issue of your problem. You deserve answers as to why your wife is unhappy because it definitely isn‚Äôt your fault, and I think a mediator can help get you those answers/open up a dialogue between your and your wife. It sounds like you‚Äôve worked really hard to be an attentive partner so I hope counseling will bring you some clarity and reconciliation.I wish you the best!
hm1wdi,I also second this advice. I struggled hearing people claim she's weaponizing sex without hearing her side of things. Mostly because, for personal reasons, I discussed with my partner about abstaining until we got married after several years of dating with sex. The difference was that I explained why I wanted it and he understood and agreed. When we did get married his brother was staying with us so we didn't feel comfortable having sex with him in the other room. We decided to have a date night as soon as he left and we've been intimate since. I also struggle with a weirdly fluctuating sex drive which sometimes causes issues and I struggled with finding a way to express what I wanted when being intimate.I have no way of knowing if your wife has legitimate issues or is weaponizing sex. I think you need professional help to determine that but she has a responsibility to figure herself out and make a decision one way or another. It's not fair to you that this has been going on for so long. She should probably get some solo counselling so she can have a safe space to flesh out her own issues as well as couples counselling so you can both work to achieve some sort of endgame to this. So sorry you are going through this. It's so hard trying to figure out what's best for you when you don't know what's going on.
hm1wdi,Thank you for your comment! Going to look into this route. Hopefully it will help
nsbhlr,Stand firm OP.You are a good person. Keep standing tall.This whole situation is on your sister's head but she's trying to blame you for supporting two of the three victims of her shenanigans.It sounds like you are the scapegoat of the family.You are not putting the two men above your niece.  Your sister is weaponizing her.   She is the one not allowing you to see her.  Don't buy into their manipulative BS.Your sister could very easily set up times where you can visit your niece, go on an outing to the park for example, etc.  She is the one putting the kabosh on this.I find it admirable that you are ultimately benefiting your niece by clearing up her paternity situation and allowing her bio-Dad to claim his rights to her.  I especially find it admirable that you are supporting your BIL after the massive betrayal that he has endured via your sister's hand.Keep walking tall and don't lower yourself to your 'family's' non existent ethics.
nsbhlr,All of this is literally her fault. She does not get to decide what you do.
nsbhlr,Sorry, your sister needs to (figuratively) be set on fire, she is the reason this happened. Paternity fraud, cheating, lying... just scum. There are 3 victims here, Jane, Tom and Bill. I understand Tom‚Äôs position, I don‚Äôt think I could raise another man‚Äôs child. I honestly believe it would be my worst nightmare if my son wasn‚Äôt mine.It doesn‚Äôt matter what your family thinks, Bill has rights, he is going to be involved, they need to deal with this. It seems everything he has done is honorable, reaching out must have been hard.This has got to be awful for Jane, my heart breaks for her, luckily there are still a large number of people fighting to be involved. I think she is going to be okay, fortunately she is really young too.What a piece of shit Mary is. I hope you are doing okay, you sound like a fantastic uncle.
nsbhlr,Especially as OP has literally been in Jane's position! If anyone can understand and support her through this it's clearly him.
nsbhlr,Couldn't have said it better myself. This üôåüëèüëèüëè
nsbhlr,You're a good man, OP. Stand your ground. Don't let Tom fall to a sad state. Be there for him. Disregard what your sister and family have to say.
nsbhlr,Your sister doesn't get to decide who she wants on her side. It's your choice to support who you want too.Your family showed true colours after your half siblings were born and now they are acting as if you were their family when you are supporting your BIL and your niece's bio dad.What you did is right your family is full of narrccissistic assholes.
nsbhlr,Your family is supporting the woman who cheated on her husband, had a baby with another man, and never told anyone.  They don't get a say.I find it just disgusting that their argument is that you don't get to see your niece if Tom is living with you.  They don't seem to have a problem with your niece not seeing Tom, the only dad she's known, or FFS, her newly revealed bio dad.Your want to support Tom and mediate with Bill is admirable OP!!!  You are a good person.
nsbhlr,I don't get why they'd forbid the kid from coming over when Tom is there while also saying they want Tom to be the only dad and they're mad at OP for not shaming him for abandoning the child.Frankly it's making me this is fake because that makes absolutely zero sense. If they were trying to shame him into taking responsibility for the kid, they'd be pushing the kid on him, not forbidding the kid from coming over if he's even around.
nsbhlr,SO the family wants to pretend Tom is the father although he‚Äôs the victim. They want Bill to go away although he is the father. That‚Äôs pretty f‚Äôd up and no one is considering the child. She deserves to know her true bio dad and he absolutely deserves to have custody over the lying cheater sister. Lovely how they want to blame you vs the sister that cheated than spent 3 years covering up her deceit
nsbhlr,Honestly your family is full of assholes and you're the only reasonable one. Keep helping out Tom and Bill because it will ultimately mean an easier future for your niece.
nsbhlr,You are doing right by the victims. Mary is only one in the wrong. Keep doing you.
nsbhlr,I hope Bill had a DNA test to ensure he is the father.  Who knows if he was the only one she was fooling around with when she got pregnant.  So sorry, but you are doing the right thing for Jane, Tom and Bill.Jane also deserves to have her bio father be a part of her life.  Your sister is a horrible person.  She should have known how harmful it was for you to go thru.
nsbhlr,Joining the chorus saying that your sister is a reprehensible human being and you are doing the right thing, OP. Letting another man believe he‚Äôs the father of someone else‚Äôs child is one of the most evil things one human being can do to another, and I don‚Äôt use the word evil lightly.
nsbhlr,that I should be shaming him for abandoning his daughter"its NOT his daughter, did you hit your head?"repeat ,repeat, repeat
nsbhlr,Tom became your brother once he married into the family.  Forever in my book.
nsbhlr,Good for you for supporting Tom. Omg he needs it. How terrible! Your sister and family (minus niece obviously) are out of line. Sis gets ZERO say. Less than zero. What she's done to Tom is horrific. Tom will get back on his feet and you'll be in your niece's life. She's 3 for crying out loud. She won't even know you weren't there durning this fall out. I hope Tom is okay and I'm glad he has you to help him.
nsbhlr,The problem with people is that everyone believes that Tom should just get over what happened, as if it were no biggie. Imagine being married, discovering that you were betrayed, only God knows for how long and with how many people, and the child you believe is not your biological, just imagine the size of the trauma? Can you imagine the consequences in Tom's life?If Bill knew she was married he's not that innocent! Your sister and Bill created this mess, and caused pain that other people will suffer, including the child!Your sister and family are only thinking about them! They are not thinking about the suffering and pain that will be in Tom's and that child's life, pure selfishness!
nk00cy,My guess is she wants clarity that the two of you were not together when she was engaged to him. This comment in her message is what tips it off.She accused us of having an affair and told me I ruined her life.I suspect that your b/f probably told her shortly after the accident that he wanted to call off the engagement and that he had feelings for you. The fianc√©e probably could not wrap her head around how he could throw away their relationship for a random women and instead assumed that the two of you had already had a relationship before the accident and he was cheating on her. Now she probably wants verification and closure.Honestly, it's still not a good idea to meet in person. You don't know this women at all or how stable she is. If she needs closure, do it over the phone or Facebook messages.
nk00cy,Yeah if she‚Äôs saying things like ‚Äúyou ruined my life‚Äù then meeting her could range from a cup of coffee and clearing the air to a double homicide suicide. Plus there is zero reward for meeting her. IMO not worth it.
nk00cy,Yeah, agreed. Do not meet this person. She could be okay but the chances she's not are there too. Any closure she needs can be done over messages. Also, you don't owe her anything. So only do it if you want to. I personally wouldn't want to. I'd wish her well and all of that but her ex-finaces new partner is not the right place to find healing. This is recipe for disaster!
nk00cy,You know like 99 of the advice on this sub reddit fails to take into account the possibility of violence. Bravo for brining it up.
nk00cy,The fianc√©e probably could not wrap her head around how he could throw away their relationship for a random womenPretty reasonably so. Honestly, in OP's shoes I would consider this a pretty big red flag on his part. Obviously the circumstances of their meeting shouldn't come up that often, but . . . what if a coworker really saves his ass on a project? What if he experiences some recurring health issues and finds himself fainting, waking up to strange women's faces more frequently?Throwing away an engagement over someone you met so briefly just seems really rash to me, and like the kind of person that isn't going to settle down very easily. Maybe OP doesn't want that, but if she does? She needs to tread lightly with this guy.
nk00cy,Agree. Just her accusing you of ruining her life is lols cuckoo.
nk00cy,I would not meet up with her. I would give her the time line as you know it via messenger, just to help her process better. I do feel badly for her.Like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really comfortable meeting up. I‚Äôm sorry for any pain our relationship might be causing you. We met the night of the accident when I came across his car. My next contact with him was when he found me via social media on April 3rd. We met up for a coffee on the 14th where he thanked me for my help. We didn‚Äôt start dating until the following Jan. I hope this clears up any questions you have. If you need more clarification please talk to him about it.‚Äù
nk00cy,This is the best response you can give, OP.
nk00cy,This should be higher.
nk00cy,she‚Äôs now asking me to meet up with her so she can get closure/compare notes.Do not do this. There are no notes to compare and he was the one in a relationship with her, not you. She needs to find her own closure, she won't get it from anyone else. The relationship is over, no good can come of this and honestly, you didn't cheat on her.If your relationship seems healthy, great. If he thinks of you as a savior ... not great. That is something he should explore in therapy. But none of it has anything to do with his ex.Side story: My now-husband's ex claimed he cheated on her with me. It was a total lie. SHE broke it off with him (as she had done like 10 times before, only to change her mind and he let her come back) after confessing that she'd kissed someone else. That time, he was like, this is ridiculous, I'm done. Instead of waiting for her to change her mind like usual, he gave her back all of her stuff and decided to move on. Around six months later, I broke up with my ex. Around a month after that, my now-husband told me he had feelings for me and wondered if I'd give it a shot (best. decision. ever). He knew it was fast but figured if he waited, I might meet someone else (we'd been friends for years) or he'd crack and take her back and he knew that wasn't healthy. After dating for around a month, we decided to become official, so I told him to tell her because we had mutual friends and I knew she'd flip the fuck out if she found out from someone else (turns out I was half right). He called her, told her, called me back and I could hear him getting the call waiting sound. Me: "Do you want to pick that up?" Him: "Um, no, she's having a nervous breakdown. There was a lot of screaming. I am not picking that up again." It was almost nine months since they'd broken up but she went bananas and literally blogged about how he'd cheated with me (absolutely false).So it doesn't matter how long he waited after dumping her to contact you. She probably still views it as cheating. If you know for a fact that there was no overlap, that's a her problem. She can reach out to him but closure needs to come from within. And the fact that she's blaming you suggests to me she's not very stable. Sorry not sorry. You did not ruin her life. Full stop.
nk00cy,Well, this is complicated.He's clearly got some issues to work on, be it that he thinks he owes you his life, that he's seeing you as his personal savior (damn me, now I have Depeche Mode - Personal Jesus in my head), or just in a daze with personal epiphanies about what he does/doesn't want - or a mix of some/all of that.  Be careful here, he could be obsessed with you, or just running through the streets panicking (metaphorically).  He could "come to his senses" at any time or never, so be prepared for the same/more abrupt behavior from him.Now as for the woman, I think you meeting her is a terrible idea.  There's literally no good that can come of it.  She may try and sour your relationship, or just be generally depressing and try and lay guilt on you.  If she has factual questions about the timeline or what happened that day, and you don't mind answering, do so via email and cut contact.  Unless they have kids and you'll need to be in contact, just don't.Good luck, I think you'll need it.
nk00cy,This has nothing to do with OP's post but I just want as many people as possible to know that my sister used to think that the lyrics "your own personal Jesus" was "your own personal cheese sauce"
nk00cy,Depeche Mode - Personal JesusLove that song!
nk00cy,Wow lol you took your depeche mode problem and you made it all of ours'.
nk00cy,now I have Depeche Mode - Personal Jesus in my headBest treatment for an earworm is to replace it with a better (or at least different) one.  What's next on the earworm playlist?  I'm thinkin' eitherGarmarna - Herr ManneligorLed Zeppelin - Kashmir
my0ply,You have a sleep habit. It probably took you time to get used to sleeping with her when you got married, and it probably took time to get used to sleeping in your office. It will likely take time to get used to sleeping with her again.
my0ply,Exactly. It takes time to get used to sleeping together again. Be patient and focus on the positive.
my0ply,This is so true., it's going to take time. Try reading or light exercise before bed to try and tire yourself out.
my0ply,Here here to this! Even if I‚Äôm used to sleeping someone in the same bed, if it‚Äôs someone new, I get really anxious and I have a really hard time falling asleep for at least a few weeks. Once I get comfortable again, then I can fall asleep easily. It definitely sucks not being able to get good quality sleep for a while but it sounds important to work through since it‚Äôs important to OP‚Äôs wife.
my0ply,I think sleeping alone was probably something she always disliked, but had understood why it was happening. However, I do think there does need to be a bit of a give on your end as well. It sounds like she has gone to some lengths recently to fix the problem, including going back to find a new machine.While you cannot be expected to go back to normal overnight, I do think you need to have a frank discussion, but also slowly start to make an effort to find a new normal on your end as well. Maybe try spending nights you don't have to work the next day with her. Aim for one night a week or something. Just show you're trying to make effort too, but make it clear it can't be 24/7 right away.
my0ply,This! Try "sleeping" with her on weekends for sure. Before you lived together you probably didn't have the best sleep during sleep-overs either but it didn't matter because you enjoyed the extra time together.Just show her that you still like her enough for an occasional sleepless night lol.
my0ply,Thank you for the thoughtful response and the very practical suggestion.
my0ply,I mean, won't you get used to sleeping with her over time?You can also try getting a bigger bed and a nicer mattress.And a white noise machine. Actually the sound you want is "brown noise" which doesn't have the higher frequencies. It's the sound a fan or waterfall makes.
my0ply,My wife found a noise maker that's a fan inside a mini wind tunnel enclosure. It has adjustable vents and two speeds to change the pitch and volume.
my0ply,There are white noise apps these days.  I like NoiseWall myself (android).  It does White, Pink, Red, and Brown noise.  Just be sure to put your phone on airplane mode so you don't get unnecessary electromagnetic radiation next to your head while you sleep.
my0ply,My wife and I used to share a Full and I couldn't sleep at all, then we got a King and we both sleep so much better.
my0ply,Kings are definitely the best way to go! So much space and comfort, but still have proximity to intimacy
my0ply,My fiancee and I have come along way in the past 8 or so years (long time, I know... it's fine though we're both cool with it). I look back at sleeping on a full together... Now that we have a king. That's one of those "we made it" things that I absolutely cherish
my0ply,More than one person in a full? üò≥ Even a queen is too small for two people honestly lol
my0ply,This. Even the difference between a Full and a Queen was huge for us. I had trouble sleeping with my bf in the Full; I would wake up every time he moved. Now we have the Queen and I also starting using a body pillow to align my back, since I‚Äôm a side sleeper (side note: this is a game changer, y‚Äôall) and I hardly notice he‚Äôs there most nights, since he can‚Äôt accidentally kick my feet now lol. Both of us sleep so much better now. Cuddling is great, but when it‚Äôs time to sleep I need to be left alone dammit, and now I finally have the space for that!
my0ply,my wife and i have had seperate rooms for over 10 years!  its great! And we are still very happy, very much in love, and still very sexually active!
my0ply,Throughout history, people who could afford separate bedrooms used them. We're living in a weird bubble now where the symbolism trumps practicality.If you like sleeping apart, keep it up. It's a game changer imo.
my0ply,My husband and I have separate bedrooms. It has saved my sleep and my mental health. He uses a CPAP and is a restless sleeper. I‚Äôm a light sleeper and struggle with insomnia and staying asleep. After my sleeping on the couch for a year, we rearranged our house to allow me my own room. As much as I‚Äôd like to have the intimacy of sleeping together, we just don‚Äôt work together sleep-wise. I‚Äôm far more comfortable in every respect having my own room.
izin4j,Just be up front! She has had clients come and go before you. Your kid is now in school and you can do the cleaning yourself. She runs a business, it's ok.Have her come for one last cleaning and chat.
izin4j,I've never been a cleaning person, but I've had a  business where I came to people's houses and taught lessons or other things like that. I had tons of clients over the years, and became friends with many of them. Never was I offended when someone wanted or needed to quit. Not even when one of my favorite students quit because she needed someone to teach her a very specific exam that I didn't have experience with, or when they preferred a different teacher. It is what it is. :)
izin4j,When I cleaned for a really nice lady who had two kids and my services were no longer needed, I was given two weeks pay because the termination was sudden. The pay was given to keep me afloat while I searched for another job. Maybe OP can do the same, if she is in a financial position to do so.
izin4j,Also, see if she wants to drop in regularly as a friend for tea and chat!
izin4j,Id start selling her to other people you know that might benefit from having a little help.  Then you can say I dont really need any more help but So and So would love for you to help them.  At least that way you help both of you.
izin4j,Yep! Used to work as a tutor. Had a few families I became friends with and never got upset when they didn‚Äôt need my services anymore =)
izin4j,Id suggest saying that due to the change in your daily routine (little one in nursery, woo!) you're able to handle a lot more housework than when you first hired your friend. You no longer require her services, but you'd love to continue the standing coffee dates! Maybe offer a name of a new client referral (check in with that possible client prior to reaching out maybe?) to fill the time she used to spend at your house, and/or offer the two weeks pay as appreciation for all the time she spent helping make your house a home or something like that.IMO, highlighting your appreciation is always a good move in almost any situation so that it's clear it's not a "you're the problem" thing, if that makes sense? And ensuring that you tell her you intend to stay friends and that this wasn't only a working relationship may sit well with her too. I think a text or call or even over coffee with her next visit may work, whatever feels more natural for your relationship. Good luck, OP!
izin4j,Love this answer! Being able to offer a friend or someone who could use her services would be great for her. I also like the thought of you paying her for 2 weeks, because it's not as easy to earn money when your regular has suddenly fired you and now you have to find a way to fill in that gap. If you think there's another service she could help you with, maybe babysitting once in a while, you can also ask her if she has experience! I've met many cleaning ladies who were also nannies and vice versa.
izin4j,Almost word for word what I was going to say. Perfect!
izin4j,I own a successful cleaning business, and have had a couple clients quit services due to the same reasons. Retirement, having a baby, starting to work from home, etc. It never offends me, and a professional knows that these things happen. You just get a new client to replace the old one, and move on.Sometimes, it does sting a little, as I love my clients and enjoy seeing them. One of them, I was with him even on his death bed and until he died. His family and I had become extremely close, and we remain friends to this day. Then his ex wife hired me in fact, so I get to stay with the family on a biweekly basis, still.Cleaning ladies and their clients tend to get close. It's almost impossible not to. We know everything about you, and the relationship is rather intimate; in that we literally clean your pubic hair out of drains, know where you keep your dildos, and can tell when you're having marital problems, know if your husband is cheating, know your kids' school grades, etc. Not because we're snooping, but our job literally requires us to get every square inch of your house, and we see things unintentionally while doing our jobs. Our job is to not judge, not say anything, and just clean. We're also often the blasting board for when couples are fighting and the woman (usually) wants to vent about it. We help them work through it--I've even sat with clients and hugged them while they cried about an impending divorce. Once, I cried, too! We therefore care about our clients deeply, and would do anything for them.I had a client drop me a couple years ago because her job changed, and she was suddenly able to clean for herself. She told me in a text, which honestly, I preferred. Rejection face-to-face sucks, and it DOES feel like rejection. You don't feel "needed" anymore, and you worry you'll lose touch with that client. But your job as a professional is to internalize any pain I might be feeling and just accept it. We remain good friends to this day, and honestly, it's nice going to her house just to have coffee and a chat, instead of having to clean and try to talk to her at the same time.Let her know, maybe, that you'd like to remain friends and maybe do coffee once a month. She will appreciate it, I'm sure. And you might find a very dear friend in her when you don't view her as your cleaning lady anymore.
izin4j,The things we see and hear!üòÇ I once found a fleshlight under a bedüò≥üò≥
izin4j,Book one more clean and tell her it‚Äôs your last; baby is going to nursery now so it‚Äôs not in the budget. Ask where you can give her a glowing review and wish her the best. It‚Äôs business :) diplomatic and kind but no guilt.
izin4j,I wouldn't go with the budget lie. You don't want her to offer a lower fee, or ask about it, or see that you've bought something new and fancy and know you're lying. Why not just be honest and straightforward?
izin4j,Just be honest with her."Karen, thank you for all the great work you've done over the past couple of years. With Grayson in nursery now, I have the time to handle the cleaning myself and unfortunately will not require your services anymore and won't be booking cleaning sessions with you going forward. In lieu of notice, I've decided to pay you two weeks worth of pay. I do hope we can go grab a coffee sometime though!"Also, double check your local employment laws. Just because you don't have a formal employment contract with her does not mean she's not entitled to notice or pay in lieu of notice.
izin4j,What's the best way to fire a friend??The professional relationship is the paramount relationship. So just tell her straight. My life situation has changed and I don't need a house cleaner.As far as that severance pay, that is a very nice gesture.I now have the free time to do the cleaning she did myself. To complicate matters a bit, the standard of her cleaning has decreased of late which has been annoying, but I don't like to tell her how to do her job because we're friendsYour take away from this is that it is ok to be friendly with trades that you hire but don't be their friends.I never hire friends. There are times when professional interactions have to be unpleasent and confrontational.If you are not happy with her work product, she really has a right to know. You are her customer, if you are not happy with her product she needs to know what to change or decide your expectations are unreasonable.Lets say she lists you as a reference. What will you do is a new potential client of hers calls?
izin4j,Just call her, definitely don't make her come all the way to your house just to fire her.  It's totally understandable, I am sure she is used to cleaning clients coming and going as life circumstances change. Just tell her "hey, so since the baby is at day care now, I can clean the house myself.  Thanks for all your help these past couple of years."  Don't bother mentioning the fact she has slacked off on quality.Then try to hang out with her as a friend sometime soon. This is a total nothingburger, don't worry.
izin4j,Just be honest and say that since you're child is in nursery, you won't been needing a regular house cleaner anymore, but that you will keep her in mind if you need any special event or big cleaning, and you're happy to give her a reference.
izin4j,You think she is a friend and can‚Äôt lay her off. She thinks you are a friend and she doesn‚Äôt have to clean as well anymore. I‚Äôd try to do better for a friend than for a regular person. Are you sure you are not being taken advantage of?
izin4j,I agree with other comments but I also think it would be smart to keep using her services since raising a toddler is hell and you‚Äôre going to want days off from cleaning and playing homemaker.Maybe instead of coming weekly or biweekly, you could have her come once a month to deep clean and also gives you the opportunity to socialize with your friend while still supporting her business.
izin4j,‚ÄúYou know Lisa, I think my routine has changed a lot more now since baby has grown up so much, and now I have more time to do more things around the house, so  I think I can take it from now on. I wanna thank you so much for your help, you really made a difference for me.‚Äù Wait for her answer. If she graciously accepts it, ask her out for dinner later or whenever she has time. If she gets offended by this, I don‚Äôt think you were friends after all. Text is fine.
n7jcfj,It isn't about the books.She may still need time to process, there may also have been something awkward involved in the coming out that you don't know about (e.g. the friend has a crush on your daughter) or she could feel hurt that she didn't know sooner, etc. There are a lot of options for what might have happened, and unless your daughter decides to tell you about it, there's not much you can do.When she makes snide comments I recommend "I didn't know you were fighting, you never told me" and "when you're ready to talk about it, I'm here, but you know what you're saying isn't true".However, your husband is also right. They will figure it out themselves, they are teenagers, this is what they do. You don't need to interfere with their business, your only job is to remind her that her comments to you are unacceptable.
n7jcfj,If reddit was around years ago my own mother could have posted something similar to this about me.  My mom was always involved in my friends lives (and way to involved in the issues of other adults, but that is another story), but a little out of touch when it came to mine.  My parents were giving me lots of space to be a moody teenager, almost a little too much. Because I was not acting up or acting out they left me alone. I was still craving one on one time with them, but didn‚Äôt know how to ask for it. Since nothing was technically wrong I couldn‚Äôt voice that I still needed some of the attention I needed as a small child.  I feel get incredibly let down, not necessarily jealous, when I saw mom giving help to others rather than me. A sixteen year old is so close to being an adult, but not quite there yet, especially emotionally.Maybe some time together without a friend just doing something fun like getting coffee, ice cream, or a walk and not talking about other people‚Äôs issues unless she brings it up will help soothe things over.
n7jcfj,I don't think ignoring it is going to solve anything; in fact, it will make it worse. You did a kind thing for her friend but it sounds like your daughter is jealous. Tell her that you love her. Spend time with her just the two of you or the three of you as a family. You know, you could make her favorite dinner or watch a movie together. Don't pressure her to spend time with you but let her know that you're there for her.
n7jcfj,Do you share interests with your daughter? Do you make a point to share in the things she likes?
n7jcfj,Maybe she does not need space. Maybe she needs attention and to talk.Obviously, you have done nothing wrong borrowing those books. And if your daughter is jealous or feels like it somehow represents you taking side in conflict you know nothing about, then it means she needs something from you.Books and attention to other kids are good. But it sounds like your kid need something.
n7jcfj,It may not be about the coming out at all.I had a complex relationship with my mother as an adolescent. No one did anything wrong. My mother is wonderful and also a child therapist and professor. But she and I are really different people with different interests and ways of doing things, she was my mother and we very much had a mother and daughter relationship where she was the parent and I was the child, I was in that phase of trying to separate from my family while also wanting their love, etc. I was an awkward looking teen with big boobs compared to my frame, braces, and curly hair I didn‚Äôt yet know how to maintain. I was also one of the few biracial kids at my school. Meanwhile my childhood best friend who was conventionally pretty had a fairly neglectful mother. She spent a lot of time in middle and high school bonding with my mom. She‚Äôd call my mom her other mom, talked about how my mom was so cool and was like a friend, etc. My mother was a friend to her, not a parent, and I remember being jealous because I would have loved to have a burgeoning friendship with an adult rather than someone reminding me to eat my vegetables and monitoring my grades. My friend actually came over and wanted to see/ spend time with my mom. I remember feeling like my mom preferred her to me and that my friend preferred my mom to me. I remember feeling left out and unwanted. That‚Äôs the age where you‚Äôre both learning to grow up and also starting to get to know your parents as adults. My friend wasn‚Äôt seeing the side of my mom that was fully parenting me and treating me like the child I was rather than the adult I was becoming, including the part where conflicts happened. My mom only got to see my friend as a good teen who was in a good mood (happy to escape her own home) and on her best behavior when my mom was around. I knew my friend was sneaking out, experimenting with sex, and doing all the other things my mother would have been less than pleased with me for. My friend was having parties while her mom was out of town and had no one parenting her. From a child‚Äôs perspective it looked to me like she had the best of my mom and all the freedom in the world. I‚Äôm at school and trying to fit in with the other kids and also complaining about my parents being hard on me about grades, cleaning my room, or whatever. Meanwhile my friend is sitting right next to me, more popular and well-liked, and saying ‚Äúwhat are you talking about, your mom is the perfect mom, she‚Äôs always kind to me!‚Äù Suddenly everyone else thinks I have the cool parents and just don‚Äôt appreciate them and I have no outlet for the fact that at that age, most teens don‚Äôt think their own parents are cool unless their parents actually have poor boundaries or are not parenting that well. As a selfish teenager that hurts because my mom wasn‚Äôt always kind to me or ‚Äúcool‚Äù by the sheer fact that most parents and kids occasionally have conflicts. In other words I was well parented. But as a teen that can feel oppressive at times. I felt like everyone preferred my friend over me, other kids at school, the older guys she was sneaking out with, my parents, etc. I‚Äôm a teen, so I lacked the insight to see what my friend was going through in her own home and how that influenced her to latch on to my mom and occasionally suck up to her. There were moments where my friend performed as a better daughter to my mom than I was (bringing her a Mother‚Äôs Day card, telling her the school gossip, wanting to be seen with her at the mall). I‚Äôm at the stage where everything my parents did embarrassed me and yet I wanted their approval which is a really normal stage. Yet my mom quickly, due to my friend, morphed into the cool mom other kids confided in as well. So I was very conflicted by others thinking my parents were cool, wanting to be around them, and being treated differently by them. We weren‚Äôt allowed fast food in my house, but one night a friend‚Äôs parents told her they were getting divorced and my mom let her pick where to eat and we got McDonald‚Äôs burgers. I never got to request things like fast food burgers. I had a homemade balanced meal every night. To a teenager that can feel really confusing. At 16 I was stressed about whether I would need to go to the same college down the street that my parents taught at and my best friend is sitting there yammering on about how she can‚Äôt wait to take my mom‚Äôs classes in college. I really worried that if I did my own thing and went to college out of state or otherwise became an adult in the way I wanted, I‚Äôd be replaced. I wanted to be independent of my parents yet still loved and supported by them, and here comes my friend who seems to have easily achieved that. Social media wasn‚Äôt yet a thing when I was that age, but I imagine a social media post about how great my parents are were by someone else would have left me feeling even more unwanted and overlooked. In retrospect it all looks different. I can keep expanding on this, but hopefully you get my point.I know that is a lot of rambling about me, but hopefully the point stands. While there are huge differences between my situation and your daughter‚Äôs, hopefully it illustrates how stuff gets interpreted by a teenage brain. There are a lot of different reasons your daughter may be upset, but it is entirely possible it is exactly what she told you. That she thinks at times that you prefer others over her because she doesn‚Äôt yet have the insight to see why you helped out her friend.Just talk to your daughter. Ask her why she thinks you prefer her friends over her. Ask her what about this particular situation made her uncomfortable. If she‚Äôs ready to talk listen.
n7jcfj,You need to sit down with your daughter and talk to her. It may the attention her friend is getting, it may be some quiet homophobia she didn‚Äôt know she had, she may be queer herself and has a crush on her friend and it‚Äôs weird that instead of being a definitely not it‚Äôs a maybe I could but now she‚Äôs confronting the fact that now she‚Äôll have to come out, it could be jealousy, it could worry that things are going to change between them, it could be a lot of things. But this isn‚Äôt prying. This is taking an active interest in your daughter and her life. Talk to her.
n7jcfj,Need a lot more parents like you around.
lik86r,He didn‚Äôt propose. He caved.
lik86r,And he literally didn‚Äôt propose. He handed her an envelope straight from the mail for her to open. No thank you.
lik86r,Right, the issue isn‚Äôt the ring, it‚Äôs the whole situation
lik86r,At year 5 I gave my partner an ultimatum. He also didn't really propose. We got married. I didn't enjoy the wedding because I felt like I had dragged him down the aisle. I figured he just couldn't do grand gestures. Well, he just left me for a pilates instructor after 11 years together. Don't settle for someone who doesn't make an effort. Look back and I'm sure there's a pattern of this. You deserve someone who can't wait to marry you.
lik86r,Don‚Äôt forget that he also blatantly lied to her face and led her on for years!It‚Äôs not too late though. Don‚Äôt be a forever gf, OP. Dump this fool.
lik86r,This a thousand times, OP. It sounds like you forced his hand. Do you really want to be married to someone  you have to beg for?
lik86r,Don't marry someone who isn't excited to marry you.
lik86r,This. I had a similar breakdown but my now husband wasn‚Äôt lying when he said it was all gonna happen.. he custom designed my ring and it was taking longer than expected. He didn‚Äôt spend a ton (per my demands), but he put so much thought into it that it was insane. It was actually WAY cheaper to design my ring from scratch than to find a similar style ring with the same size/quality diamonds.OPs man just gave zero fucks.
lik86r,Yes! Don't marry someone just going through the motions.
lik86r,Exactly this, don't be with someone who isn't excited to build a life with you, you will realise how detrimental that is to your mental health in thefuture, it will slowly suck the life-force out of you and break your spirit.
lik86r,Oh God, yes!! I was married to a man for 14 years who was not excited to marry me after 4 years of dating (and no sex!!). I settled and I basically begged him to marry me. How embarrassing. Now we're divorced with 3 kids. I now have a man who asked me to marry him as soon as he could...he brings it up all the time and has a ring waiting for the perfect time. And it's my dream ring. DO NOT SETTLE for someone who is not totally excited to marry you!!
lik86r,I was about to say the problem isn‚Äôt the ring - it‚Äôs the guy who bought it for her.
lik86r,Yeah that was kind of my take too. He's clearly not into it given the need to constantly tell him that's what OP wants and finally breaking down about it, only for him to lie and get some ring with no forethought.OP, he clearly doesn't want to marry you. Not to say he doesn't love you (I have no idea about your relationship) but marriage isn't on his mind. Either figure out why and work through it or cut and run
lik86r,So there are several options of what could have happened:He didn't listen at all to what OP wanted or forgot about it completely and ended up picking everything wrong by coincidenceHe picked all the things she didn't want on purposeHe picked the cheapest options for everything, which were coincidentally what she didn't want - either because the shop which offered the cheapest rings only offered these versions or because other versions were offered but more expensiveOn top of that, either:Saving up for the ring was outright a lie because he doesn't really want to get married orHe actually might have a lot of debts OP doesn't know about orHe did actually save up for the ring, but then spent the money on other things more important to him and when he realized that she wasn't taking it anymore, he bought the ring with what little money from his 'saving money' remained.All in all, this man clearly doesn't want to get married. He is obviously feeling pressured into it by OP being so unhappy. He doesn't even want to ask if she wants to marry him or really propose and I also wonder how this will continue. After all, an engagement is only the first step. I can see this easily escalate into him either now trying to delay the actual wedding for all eternity and/or not caring about anything wedding-related at all, leaving OP with the whole organization and possibly throwing a wrench in every plan of hers by not wanting to pay for something. At the very least, he will be as uncaring about the wedding as he was about the proposal.OP needs to decide if the fact that she is going to marry a man who doesn't want to marry her and is only doing so to keep her is something she really desires. I personally wouldn't want to marry someone who doesn't want to be married to me and isn't excited about the idea of becoming an "official" family unit. I think the ring is actually the least of OP's worry - it represents the glaring problems in the relationship, nothing else. This isn't about the ring. The ring can be changed, but that won't change the fiance's attitude about getting married.
ltq6pp,Is there someway I can approach this, and still keep both my family and fiance?Don't marry a problematic drunk who's mentally 12 years old? That's my absolute best advice in your situation. Cuz this type of thing tends to only gets worse.
ltq6pp,Definitely will get worst if he marries her.  Pretty soon, OP may only talk and see his family once in a while because the wife still holds a grudge.  Then once there are kids, she will probably use the kids to get the upper hand and kids probably won‚Äôt have a relationship with his side of the family.  Her true colors are coming out.
ltq6pp,Are you sure you want to get married?
ltq6pp,There was never going to be a good reason for your SIL to stir up drama with your sister‚Äôs abusive ex-husband.Sorry, but your fiancee is more concerned with being right then doing right. This is not a good trait in a life partner.
ltq6pp,Yeah just completely unnecessary drama to THIS extent too... I agree with others OP, pause the wedding until you two sort this out. Maybe she‚Äôll see the light, maybe she won‚Äôt, but from what you‚Äôve shared she sounds awfully determined to judge others and get involved where she doesn‚Äôt need to.‚ÄúDrunk dial‚Äùing a partner‚Äôs family is NOT fucking OK either btw, Jesus Christ is she 16?
ltq6pp,Halt the wedding planning. You both need more time to come together or break up. Your fianc√© disrespected you and your family. Gossiping and creating drama rather than letting you do what you both agreed to do. She is refusing to see what damage her actions did. She will drive a wedge between you and your family and then it will carry over between the two of you.
ltq6pp,I mean, do you want to keep your fiance? She sounds like a drama llama, somebody who has no trouble burning multiple bridges in a blaze of glory. Think of how differently this could have gone if she hadn't decided to go scorched earth everywhere. She could've said, "I don't feel comfortable with this guy with a criminal past at my wedding" and maybe told the sister you guys are keeping a tighter wedding budget and guest list and she can't bring a +1. Simple.Instead she blabs some things she was probably told to keep a secret to her own sister, who then messages the ex-husband (like ..why?! it's so unnecessary) and all this leads to further drama, further hurt and now she's not admitting fault to any of it. At the very least, I would expect her to be mortified this got so out of hand and maybe blamed some of her actions on alcohol consumption (not that this excuses any of it).Your family sounds very graceful, I would just think hard if this kind of a person is somebody you truly want to spend the rest of your life with. How many more fires are you gonna find the next time you go out of town for a work thing? She is not even willing to admit fault, which is not promising this won't happen again .. and again, and again. Oof.
ltq6pp,Fianc√© and fianc√©‚Äôs sister both seem to have the same approach to drama, ie why avoid it when you can create it?
ltq6pp,I'm wondering if all guests are going to have to have a criminal background check or does she only not want your sister's bf cause she knows he has a criminal background? Not many people just tell people if they've been arrested or not. Besides that..It seems like your fiance is starting things for no reason, your sister already said that she wouldn't bring her bf to your wedding, why did the ex-husband need to be informed? That was unnecessary and now it's turned into this whole big thing.. and all your fiance had to do was keep her mouth shut about something that was told to her in confidence.I feel like instead of working on the wedding, you guys really need to work on your relationship. And not just you and your fiances but your family's relationship as well. Right now, it doesn't seem like your fiance cares much about your family at all, are you wanting to spend the rest of your life with someone who treats your family this way?
ltq6pp,You need to put the wedding on hold. Cancel, if you have to. This is a serious development in your relationship and you are learning some ugly things about your fianc√©e‚Äôs character.Hopefully that‚Äôll impress upon her how badly she‚Äôs screwed up here. Her sister easily could have put your sister in physical danger by sending that message, and it was a huge betrayal. And the fact that your fianc√©e is unapologetically siding with her sister on this is a good indication that she wasn‚Äôt as uninvolved in this scheme as she claims. If she wants to die on this hill, you need to think long and hard before you make this woman‚Äôs ties to your family official. This relationship may not be the wise investment that you previously thought.
ltq6pp,There's something going on with your fiancee. She's running her mouth, getting drunk and stirring drama. Your sister's choice to leave her marriage and date is hers and hers alone and your fiancee shouldn't be involved in judging or gossiping or pushing her around or "getting her in trouble" with the ex. It's childish. But it shows that your fiancee is lacking attention. Does she do other attention seeking behaviors? Some of it might be that she's missing you as you're literally absent. Talk to her, find out what is her unmet need that's at the root of this.I'm also curious that she's pushing your family away. She may feel insecurely attached to you and want to jealously guard your attention by cutting off your family.You aren't totally clear here either. You also don't have to participate in talking about people instead of to them. If you have an issue with one person in the family, go directly to them.But there was no need at any point to pass judgement on your sister's dating life. Since that seems to be what set your fiancee off, I wonder if she's anxious that even marriage won't create a secure, lifelong bond she can count on. When she initially "banned" the boyfriend from the wedding, that was a chance to get really curious with your fiancee and get to the root of why she's so insecure that she felt she had to keep your sister's bf out.Anyways the acting up and the attachment issues are an indicator that you two need to get into counseling. This needs a lot more attention before it gets better.The worst path going forward would be to try to ignore it or just make peace. You've got to get to the bottom of her bad behavior, find out what's causing it, address the root issue, and then go for a full apology to your sister. Then you guys can plan the wedding.
ltq6pp,You would only be enabling her horrible, immature behaviour by staying with her.   If my partner did this, I would be out.
ltq6pp,Should really reconsider marrying someone that is okay with causing conflict with your family and has no regrets about it. She is ok alienating you from your family. If the roles were reversed you would be called an abuser so take that into account.Second reason to reconsider. . . In case you don't see it your fiancee either has a drinking problem or is developing one. It is NOT normal to get drunk and cause chaos and send abusive texts anyone that does this or says it's okay is in denial.Don't get married to this woman she and her sister are okay with invading people's privacy and causing Hell! They contacted your sister's abusive ex! That alone should be enough to breakup!
ltq6pp,Your fiance needs to own up to what she's done wrong. Remind her that you supported her when it came to having the boyfriend at your wedding, but let her know that you can't support her on this. She shared confidential conversations with her sister, she defended her sister doing something she had no business doing, and she has drunkenly insulted your mom and sister multiple times. She needs to own up to what she's done wrong and apologize.
ltq6pp,In marriage, you are supposed to make decisions together as a team. This is a huge betrayal.
ltq6pp,why do you want to keep your fianc√© after she kept drama-bombing your family? like...
ltq6pp,Wow--your fiance didn't just make a mistake, she has doubled down on it and repeated it multiple times. It's pretty alarming that she says that she regrets nothing and that she did it multiple times.I agree that the first step is to pause wedding planning. I don't think that the immediate first step is to break up, but I do think that you guys need to have some serious conversations and your fiance needs to take responsibility for her actions (and understand why what she did is not ok). Couples therapy seems like a good idea. If she's not willing to do the above...I don't think this is the kind of person that you want to spend your life with.
ltq6pp,Your fiance is a gossipy drama queen omg This all revolves around her. She is the only one starting stuff. Inviting your sister's bf isn't even that big of a deal. What was he going to do if he came that is so unacceptable? Why doesn't she respect your sister enough to take the high road here?What a nightmare, I would think hard about getting married to her. It was never your problem to solve her issue with your sister's boyfriend. Your fiance should have been the one to talk to your sister, not you. I wonder if this is common for her to start problems with people and make others (you) do her dirty work or is she having some kind of break down?And the alcohol is a whole other ballpark of red flags, is this normal behavior for her? Is she having a hard time with other things lately? Is this an episode or her usual personality?
ltq6pp,You are one of the luckiest guys on reddit. You got to find out what a shit person she and her sister are. She just saves you a lot of wasted years and money. Congratulations.
ltq6pp,If you marry someone who stirs up a bunch of drama you should probably be prepared to be running around putting out fires the rest of your married life.   Honestly if someone treated my mom like that it would be a total deal breaker for me.   Your family may be willing to give her another chance but it will never be the same and the hurtful things she said will always be in the back of their heads.  They are probably  trying to be nice to her right now out of pure fear of losing a relationship with you if you marry her.
ltq6pp,OP, wait until her drinking gets worse, and within a couple of years, maybe less (because she's going to use drinking as an excuse every time she doesn't get her way), she just won't be an ugly, abusive drunk, she will be an ugly, abusive black out drunk. She won't remember anything except the lies and messed up stories and situations that she will make up. This is going to be your life, OP.. I hope you continue sticking by, and sticking up, for your family. They should not have to spend one more minute getting abused by her. You and your family will continue to receive this treatment from her, and you all are just WAY too good for this.
jjb1nr,You sound like you're doing your best. So do cut yourself a bit of slack.It is a terrifically difficult adjustment. Maybe you can try to take some of the "tasks" back that make you feel particularly close or bonded with your siblings. If there was a certain breakfast or routine that you really liked, tell her and your Dad that you plan on continuing it.You've got a chance now to make a choice about what your role in the family is, rather than having to do the work because the work had to be done. Approach this with your stepmom and dad as a choice, and talk about the things you want to be doing with your siblings, or as a family.Your stepmom is trying to free you to be a teenager. You can appreciate that, but also use some of your freedom to decide what sort of big sister you want to keep on being.In time, you might be able to help her make some changes around the house that will help you hold on to the good memories, but remove triggers like any plain old mugs that aren't sentimental, and aren't helpful. Having your blessings, and your knowledge about what can be changed and what might be hurtful to alter might be very, very welcome to her.For a lot of the rest of this, therapy might help the most. On your own at first, then maybe with her and your Dad as well.
jjb1nr,Mleek had a lot of great points here and is absolutely right on all of them. I just wanted to add, as well as getting rid of triggers, add new things too.Get your stepmom a nice mug for her birthday or Christmas that she would prefer to use over one of your mom's old mugs. I'm sure she'd really appreciate a thoughtful present like that and it would show that you are doing what you can to mend the relationship between you both.she doesn't need to know it's because you don't want her touching other mugs, unless you think that would be helpful.This is a major adjustment for you OP, it's going to take time for you to get used to your new normal. It's amazing that you have the maturity to sit down and realise your feelings, where they are coming from, and that you have resolved to do something productive about it. You're heading in a great direction.
jjb1nr,Loving your answer, thank you! <not the OP
jjb1nr,This is good sound advice OP.Being in the same house is particularly hard and it‚Äôs no wonder you feel angry. Your feelings aren‚Äôt irrational - they are a perfectly normal reaction to a huge change in your life which is bringing up grief you probably didn‚Äôt full process at the time. What matters, as you recognise, is what you do with these feelings and therapy will give you the space to examine and express them and workout how you are going to move forward.
jjb1nr,You sound like an amazing young woman who had to grow up before her time.  I bet your stepmom 100% has you in her mind when she does these things. She wants to Unburden you and allow you to have time Back to yourself.  Why don‚Äôt you suggest a 1:1 coffee/lunch? Then you can explain that you appreciate what she is doing but you got self worth from those tasks.  Maybe suggest a compromise? You take care of the mornings a day or two of the week.  You make dinner every Friday. You read with the kids before bed.  That way you are keeping some of your role but allowing her to grow and take over some as well.
jjb1nr,Yes. TELL HER that you know it‚Äôs irrational but you‚Äôre having these feelings. She obviously will have noticed your hostility.Counseling both individual and as a family would probably help too.
jjb1nr,This is a great idea. You could also get her a coffee mug, or set, from you. This way she has something nice to use, and it doesn't have any of your memories attached that will upset you.It sounds like she's trying to help, and it's great that you realise your feelings are irrational, but just remember you're allowed to have feelings. Don't suppress them, let yourself feel them and have a chat to her about it.
jjb1nr,I think some therapy would be good here as well.
jjb1nr,Exactly talk to her, remember at her age she is already understanding all this but she would want to talk to you about this. Talk to her, pour out your heart. She will never replace your mom. But it doesn't hurt to have a very good mature friend. She'll probably love this. And try to get closer to you. Communication is always the only way to build relationships.
jjb1nr,As a step mum this cuts deep. I'm so sorry you are feeling this way. You sound like an amazing young woman and should be very proud of yourself and your ability to recognise the situation for what it is.The statement you wrote is very well written. I suggest you ask you dad and Stepmom to have a private conversation. I find personally it's easier to have hard conversations when going for a walk, it helps you have something to do and also avoids awkward eye contact the whole time. But do it how makes you feel most comfortable.Read them your Reddit post, and apologise to your step mum for your behaviour. Ask them if you can start therapy so that you can try to work through this and repair the relationship, and grieve your mother.Maybe suggest some small things that might make you feel better, new mugs as suggested above, and put aside special keepsakes. Maybe they should change the furniture in the master bedroom or paint it a different colour. Have a think about what you think would help you. Or maybe wait to discuss with your therapist.It sounds like your step mother wants to give you your childhood back, and really cares for you all. Believe me when I say you reading this to her will probably give her so much relief. She I am sure realises you are struggling but doesn't know how to help you. Knowing this information will help all of you to build a happy relationship and move forward in a way that respects your mother but also your step mother.Be very proud of yourself, but also speak up so that you can get the help and life changes you need. It sounds like there is a lot of love in your family and it just takes a while to work out the dynamics in such a complex situation. Big hugs.Look forward to the update and also feel free to DM me any time. My step kids are teenagers and I've been around for 3 years so I can relate to the situation a lot.
jjb1nr,This is such a good comment and perspective.I'm not a step parent, but was also going to suggest showing your step mum and dad this post. She sounds like a caring person and hopefully is also understanding. I think it would be a relief for her, to know that your behaviour towards her isn't personal, that it's not who she is as a person or something about her personality or beliefs or anything, but it something that would be occuring no matter who the  person stepping into that parental role you had filled for so long. I think it's probably also extra difficult because the other children are still young enough that they are dependent on someone but you are independent. You're not 'one of the kids' but you're responsibilities as 'one of the adults' have been dissolved. You've been displaced and that's really hard. Your formative years as an adolescent you were a caregiver, while you were supported to have a 'child' life outside of that, its hard to switch maturity on and off and would have had a part in shaping your development and experiences as a 'kid' learning who you are.It's hard to switch a sense of responsibility off once you've developed it. I definitely agree with all the suggestions about counseling and therapy, it can be very very useful for all the already mentioned reasons, and also so someone can help you let go of some of that mature sense of responsibility and find similar enjoyment and fulfillment in your relationship with yourself. To learn how to enjoy being a kid with kid responsibilities. I don't know if I explained that well. You seem so mature, it's hard to enjoy not being an adult when you learned how to be one before developing that sense of teenage 'selfishness' (which in balance is a healthy/important sense of self to have), I really do apologise if what I've said doesn't make sense.I'm also guessing that stepmom doesn't really do anything for you (not in a bad way, but just because you're independent and probably prefer to do things for yourself) so it seems like it could be extra hard because your relationship with her doesn't have a function in a way that everyone else has (wife to your dad, caregiver to your siblings, but ?? to you if that makes sense) I'm not sure what kind of functions you could place on your relationship, but perhaps a kind of friendship eventually, like a 'cool aunt', without the relationship having a purpose or function, it's completely understandable (among the other understandable reasons you mentioned) that it might naturally default towards conflict. A resentful relationship is still a form of relationship, it gives her an assigned role in your mind, it initiates communication and 'bonding', just in negative ways which you've recognised as a problem and wish to resolve. I think a therapist who can help you find an appropriate function/role in your life for your stepmom, and help with some ways to develop your inner 'entitled teenager' will be super beneficial.you're really an astounding young person to realise that this type of connection isn't healthy and might be coming from an irrational place. I can imagine it feels lonely in your position. I wish you all the luck with this. I hope that if you show this post to your dad and stepmom, they express the sense of pride and respect in who you are, that many of us reading your post have felt. You are so caring and bright and I have no doubt you can achieve absolutely anything. Best wishes and good luck at college in the future!
jjb1nr,I agree with this. Be kind to yourself OP, and keep us updated. Sending lots of hugs.!RemindMe 2 weeks
jjb1nr,I can understand why you are feeling this way. At least you realize that your feelings are irrational.Ask your dad if you can get into therapy. This post is beautiful and concise. I bet you could read it to the both of them, and they would understand how you are feeling.You could make some immediate changes to help you feel more comfortable. For example: new mugs!Have a yard sale and get rid of some things, but also put things away that you feel strongly about in a keepsake box for you and your siblings.Best wishes and big hugs to you, I know what it's like to have a parent die as a kid.
jjb1nr,I second this. You already know your feelings are irrational. Tell your dad you need therapy to help adjust to the new family dynamics.Buy her a coffee mug. Tell her that while it still hurts to see her use your moms cup, you want her to have her own special mug that is hers alone.Thank her for jumping in and helping in the mornings,  but let her know it has been your special time with your siblings for awhile and you would like to split morning shifts with her instead of her fully taking over. That way she can still sleep in from time to time.And stop. breathe.  just be a kid again.
jjb1nr,It is very mature of you to realize your feelings are unfair and irrational and want to work on them. I'm impressed.First, I think you should ask your father if you could see a therapist. Tell him you are struggling with the new family dynamic, the change in your role, and this has also brought up new feelings about losing your mom. That you'd really appreciate the help of a professional to work through them. Lots of people have irrational and harmful feelings they need to deal with and it's much of what therapy is for.Second, if you liked doing some of those things you could ask/offer to do them occasionally. It's unfair for a child to be put in the position to have to be a parent and do all the things you did. So your dad and stepmom are trying to take that burden off your shoulders. However, there is a difference between HAVING to make dinner and wanting to make it sometimes. Or having to drive your siblings around and wanting to have some time with them sometimes. Talk to your dad and stepmom. Tell them step-mom has really stepped up around the house and you've noticed all her hard work. (Trying to phrase things without the word appreciate, since you don't seem to.) However, you miss doing some of those things and would like to make a schedule so you can still do some of them sometimes. For example, maybe you and your younger siblings could make a special breakfast together every Sunday. Or Wednesday could be your night to make dinner. Or you can still give the kids rides sometimes. Ect. Think about exactly what you wish you could still do and how often, so that it becomes occasional quality time and not an obligation for you.
jjb1nr,You sound incredibly thoughtful and responsible. From what you've said, it sounds like your stepmom is trying to give you the chance to be a kid again, by taking over the "parental" responsibilities. However, it sounds like you and your dad and stepmom should sit down and talk about this all - it might help if you were, like, formally thanked for stepping up into an adult role for all that time and maybe you could officially pass those responsibilities back to the adults in the house (hand over a broom or a roomba?) and they could hand you a game controller, or something that represents fun and adolescence.Your dad needs to tell you that you are loved and important and vital because you are you, not because of what you can do for the family unit.This is one of those situations where it really sounds like all of you just need to have some on-going honest conversations, whether it's at home or with the help of a counselor. Everyone is really acting so kindly towards each other, and you sound like you are finally having the chance to deal with a bunch of emotions that you didn't allow yourself to have when things were harder.I would say talk with your dad first. And it sounds like you could even talk with your stepmom, but be sure to let her know that you have these feelings even though you know they aren't fair to her and that you don't want to feel this way.I wish you so much luck working this out. I'm so terribly sorry for the loss of your mom and I hope you and your stepmom find a way forward in your relationship, whatever it ends up being.
jjb1nr,I agree with therapy. I also think maybe you should try being a kid? You didn‚Äôt really get that opportunity as a child....to be a child. You grew up very fast and now you feel your place is being taken, but she‚Äôs taking on the role of a mother...which is not your place. But the place you inadvertently filled Added to the fact that you never properly grieved the loss of your mother, it‚Äôs important that you speak to someone, maybe individual/family therapy as well as some grief counseling for yourself. And remember to have fun, go out, do things, live your life and be a kidI wish you nothing but lucküíöETA‚ÄîMaybe once a week you can make dinner for everyone, and another day you guys can cook together, that way you are still included in those things :)
jjb1nr,I was in your exact same situation myself and I completely understand where you‚Äôre coming from. My mum passed away from a very sudden illness too and I was only 16 with a 10 year old little sister to care for. Add into the mix that my dad was working shifts full time, I basically became a mum figure.My sister grew very close with my step mum once she moved in, she‚Äôs a lovely woman who always has our interests at heart but now I‚Äôm 22 and no longer living at home, I do sometimes feel some pangs of resentment.I think the key thing is you‚Äôre aware of those feelings which is very healthy and as another commenter has said, is actually a very mature realisation. I think you need to stop beating yourself up over it. You‚Äôre adjusting to a complete change in the projection of time than you had ever actually imagined. I also think it‚Äôs important to maybe have some one on one time with her as two women in a weird and new scenario, get to know one another - this part will take time and can‚Äôt just happen after a couple of chats but just let it progress naturally. Try to see her as a friend, she‚Äôs not your parent, your dad is but she is someone who will be there for you. The best way is to help each other, she will be just as out of the loop as you are, that‚Äôs a fact.Perhaps writing how you feel and sitting down with both your dad and your step mum to talk about how you‚Äôd like to still maintain some of your own sense of normality would be a good first step. You can approach it as you helping her out too, maybe you do two mornings a week or something. But how you feel is totally okay and it isn‚Äôt a quick process.These types of step parent and child relationships are an odd phenomenon as they‚Äôre often a sudden thing we‚Äôre thrust into and you might feel like it needs to progress rapidly but from my experience, and from sitting my step mum down to talk about it, we realised we might take a good 6 months to a year to really get comfortable with each other and get to know one another. As long as you let her know you‚Äôd like that end goal, I don‚Äôt think it should matter how or when you get there.You may find r/childrenofdeadparents is a helpful subreddit to get some sound advice on this type of scenario too, it helped me process a lot of my feelings.Your mental health is just as important in all of this so take care of yourself and feel free to PM me if you‚Äôd like a bit more of a thorough chat. All the best OP
jjb1nr,You sound lovely. Your feelings aren‚Äôt so irrational, they‚Äôre just not about her. They‚Äôre about you. You are still very important. You are still loved. No one can replace you. No one can replace your mom. This is just the next chapter with a new player- essentially a stranger who is taking on the most intimate roles of your house. Be gentle with the both of you. Allow space for that to happen in its own time. Knowing what you already know will help this along.Love a life coach, mom and step mom.
jjb1nr,That's what a responsible adult is supposed to do.You were never meant to take on the responsibility of your mom after she passed.It sounds like you have a wonderful relationship with your siblings, and you know they will be in good hands when you go to college.Try and chat with her about how you are feeling, but don't make it seem like you don't appreciate it, just let her know it feels a little weird since you've been doing it for so long.
jjb1nr,There are so many supportive, helpful suggestions here and I think they are all great.  I suggest also that you make space in your life to grieve your mom.  You talk so practically about all your tasks - but you also have to give room to your feelings.  A lot of times people experience anger because it is covering their grief.  Your stepmom is the most obvious route that those feelings of grief will take to get out.  Get them out with a therapist, or prayer, or a friend - really feel the feelings in a safe way.  I guarantee when you have brought them out into the light, they will no longer cause you to feel anger at a woman who is only trying to help.  This may take a long time, don't rush yourself.  You will make it!
jjb1nr,No one is doing anything wrong here. Just seems like a lack of communication and unexpressed feelings.You have stepped up and helped your dad in a time of need after your mother‚Äôs passing. I commend you for that. On the other hand, your step mother is doing everything she is supposed to do and allowing you to be a kid again. That‚Äôs admirable too.You‚Äôre old enough to have a sit down with your father and step mother and discuss your feelings openly. Tell them how you feel.I might be wrong here, but I get the feeling that you have never properly dealt with losing your mother. You might have submerged your grief with keeping yourself busy by helping out. Could you maybe talk to a grief counselor or therapist?
iyggux,Your girlfriend should apologize to you, you did the right thing standing up for that poor girl. He grabbed her arm and called her a bitch, that's way out of line.Who would want to keep a friendship with an abuser?
iyggux,Apparently, OP's girlfriend would...I can't believe she is upset that she has a boyfriend that is a solid man with good morals and a backbone. The audacity of OP...SMH.   /s
iyggux,Who would want to keep a relationship with a person who is enabling and excusing an abuser? Fuck his gf for being a shitty friend to that girl.
iyggux,Amen! She should apologize to OP for sure and I think it looks really bad for his girlfriend that she should be so concerned about maintaining a friendship with a person who treats their partner that way. Even if she doesn't engage in that behavior herself, she's at least endorsing it with her silence. Not a good look.
iyggux,Yeah I'm pretty appalled she claimed she was embarrassed by her boyfriend's actions when her friends bf was acting like a grade A tool. I would have been way, way more embarrassed being in the presence of that guy causing a scene.
iyggux,Sadly, its very common. Its clear she cares more about the feelings of an abusive assThis would make me reconsider things with my partner pretty quickly if they did this after I stood up for someone. I dont know if you know the girl OP but I would reach our or have a woman you know reach out and offer information of domestic abuse services, it might help her to know someone has her back
iyggux,OP! You, sir, are a good human. Thank you for your service to mankind.
iyggux,Sure that really correct
iyggux,I fail to see how you're the problem when your girlfriend is the one who is perfectly okay being friends with an abuser.
iyggux,Came here to say exactly this! Personally I would be very proud of my MAN for standing up to the pathetic excuse of a "man" who has to physically and verbally control his girl like that. Clearly OP is a much better person than his gf and that douche nozzle. Get out now and help that poor abused girl get out too if you can.
iyggux,People will go a long way to ignore abuse, even if the signs are right in front of them.  She probably hasn‚Äôt come to terms with the likelihood that he is an abuser and is mad that OP rocked the boat.
iyggux,The fact that she cares more about not rocking the boat with this ass than she does about him basically assaulting his girlfriend in front of you doesn't say anything good about your girlfriend. You did the right thing and she is at best a selfish coward.
iyggux,Your girlfriend is colluding with the domestic violence you two were witnessing because she is afraid of losing her friend. You did what you thought was right, and it was a caring thing to do. The difficult thing is that her friend might get hurt more because of the abusive boyfriend being called out. However, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the issue. Your girlfriend exposed you to domestic violence without even letting you know about the dynamic. It also seems like there wasn‚Äôt some goal of helping her friend, etc. Your gf really owes you an apology for multiple reasons, including how she has treated you since. I‚Äôd consider ending this if she believes her behavior has been justified in such an extreme situation.Edit: typos
iyggux,no, her friend is the GUY, not the girl (read the title). she‚Äôs not worried that her girlfriend could be hurt more for calling this out. she cares about keeping her relationship with her guy friend who is an abuser and not rocking the boat with him. that is extremely fucked up.
iyggux,Yeah, she was 100% aware of this dynamic beforehand. I bet in part she's angry at OP because she's angry at herself for not knowing what to do.
iyggux,That poor girl, you were amazing to stand up for her - I can't believe your gf isn't applauding you for what you did, a lot of other people would just keep quiet to avoid a scene.If she doesn't want to speak to you again over this, then I really think you shouldn't chase after her. It's a big red flag that she seems to think her friend wasn't being abused
iyggux,It's worse than you think, her friend is the guy!
iyggux,There's an analogy called The Missing Stair. A friend in a group is a problem, but the group just steps around them like they're a missing step on the staircase. No one attempts to fix the stair, or protect visitors from accidentally tripping up.  If you trip up, it's your own fault, can't you see there's a missing stair?It's easier for her to pretend not to see domestic abuse so she can maintain her friendship, but be real, if she actually cared about that girl she wouldn't be doing that. Because you acknowledged the reality you were seeing, you broke the illusion and now she's mad at you for not living in a fantasy land where that's "just how he is!".  To her, it's your fault you didn't see the missing stair, not hers for failing to stick up for her girl friend ages ago.
iyggux,Sorry, but your girlfriend is a bad person.
j5ajl3,As a child product of a painful divorce when i was young, PLEASE do not let the children stop you from doing what is right. Staying together for the kids is not a good idea and though it feels so heavy,  like you are throwing a whole life away, you are really showing the strength to begin the life you and your kids deserve. His behavior sounds like one he needs help for, lying, cheating, hiding.  By staying out of comfort you are showing your children that is OK to accept bad behavior. You are willingly letting a man raise them whose morals are suspect and you will spend your life hiding his misdeeds from them. I lived in that house, kids pick up on everything, do them the favor of doing the right thing. Maybe start with counseling, see if you can work together to fix this but your husband needs to be the one doing the work and if he doesn't, say goodbye.
j5ajl3,I'm all for this. I actually wished my parents divorced when we were younger. My mother did not break up with my cheating father on the first sign of his infidelity and stayed married with him for 30+ years. I have heard them fight constantly for that long, hearing names of 6 different women in that time span (separate occasions--one mistress after another) and it has caused me trauma. I'm the eldest in the family. He always say, I will break up with my mistress--he does; and then months/years later, another mistress--another name to fight over with.I once heard him tell a mistress over the phone that the reason he married my mother was because she got knocked up with me (which was untrue because I was born a year after their wedding--meaning I was concieved months after they got married). For years I actually thought it was my fault that my parents are in this toxic relationship and it has taken a toll on my mental health. I thought if I wasn't born, my mother could have just walked away on the first time my father cheated.It took me years after moving out to finally recognize that my anxiety and depression rooted from my family. I'm on therapy now, getting the help I need.My brother cheated on his exes too. He took after my father's lifestyle.OP, do not stay for the kids. I beg you not to make your kids end up like me and my brother.
j5ajl3,I just sent this to someone going through it right now, it's so perfect.
j5ajl3,Your son will be better off with divorced parents than he will if he grows up knowing about his father's infidelities -- and he will almost certainly know. Your husband is never going to stop cheating, and kids pick up on this kind of thing remarkably quickly.
j5ajl3,Totally agreed.I find it quite difficult to get my head around the fact that people stay in unhappy marriages "for the kids". "I don't want to hurt my 4yo kid"... While in reality, the older the kid is, the worst it'll be for him, especially to grow up in a family knowing that mum and dad have issues, fighting, etc. Kid will be worse off if the parents stay together. The situation is bad enough that it's easy to predict that sooner or later they'll end up divorcing.
j5ajl3,I agree on the being better off part. I dated someone who came from a house where the mother wouldn‚Äôt divorce the father for the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do that to the kids‚Äù reason. And let‚Äôs just say he knew that (and eventually this kid will too) and boy, was it a huge psychological driver for a lot of anger, resentment, and other toxic traits. I‚Äôm not inferring that either. He was very vocal on that point.OP, your son will be better off in a home that isn‚Äôt broken from the inside. He will sense it, it will hurt him.(That being said. I also never discount couples counseling first to see if you can get back to a healthy place. If you can‚Äôt though...)
j5ajl3,Kids learn about marriage and relationships by observing their parents. They'll grow up and learn that it's normal to fight, to cheat, to make each other unhappy. And they'll have to unlearn all of that.
j5ajl3,This happened to a friend of mine. She was 8 months pregnant when she found out her husband was cheating her. She went through 3 rounds of IVF to get pregnant second child. Divorce was the only option for her and she is now, a few years later, engaged to a wonderful man with two kids of his own. They are literally made for each other. Be strong and stand up for yourself. You'll be happier in the long run.
j5ajl3,I think divorce is a lot easier the younger the kid is. My brothers and I didnt have the same issues that our okder friends did.Obviously reddit is going to tell you to leave him because that's what it does.  Only you know what your whole situation is like.   Can you afford to live on your own? Can you live with always wondering if he's being unfaithful?I personally couldn't be with my husband anymore if he did that, but I could also move back in with my mom easily.If you have proof of what he's done, save it, but know that some places don't look favorably on spouses looking into the other person's phone.  I would get a consultation with a lawyer to see what your options are.  That may be free depending on where you are.  Then get a therapist if you can afford it.  Whether you stay with him or not,  this is gonna mess with you for awhile.Lastly, I am so sorry.  You've been dealt a sucky hand that you don't deserve
j5ajl3,Thank you so much for taking supporting systems into account. ‚ô•Ô∏è
j5ajl3,Everyone else has covered the "you need to divorce" schtick so I won't repeat that, but I just want to add: get an STD check. Immediately. Yesterday.
j5ajl3,This!  Not only can it be dangerous for your health, but untreated STDs can be dangerous for your baby.  There‚Äôs a very real chance he has slept with someone else especially after finding the MeetMe account.  Don‚Äôt be embarrassed to talk to your OB and request a STD test.  I was also cheated on when I was pregnant and my OB didn‚Äôt bat an eye when I requested a test.  If you really can‚Äôt talk to your OB, many health departments or other organizations have confidential STD testing.  You can take the time you need to make any decisions regarding your marriage, but the one incredibly important thing you need to do right now is get a STD test.
j5ajl3,I'm sorry your going through this. This is a very difficult situation to be in considering you have a child already and are currently pregnant. I would suggest he needs to immediately agree to marriage counseling. It is perfectly acceptable to be pissed and to leave him but the counseling can help either way. If you are going to divorce you will need a plan in place. Keep proof of all infidelity that you can and do not get rid of it even if you decide to stay with him. Is he sorry? Is he actively trying to show you he's sorry? He should also remove all of those profiles and remove a password from his phone. Not so you can snoop but to prove he has nothing to hide. This is a chance for both of you to prove you trust each other. Him showing he isn't screwing up and you resisting checking up on him. Thats if you even want to stay. Good luck and if you have any questions I'd be happy to help. Stay strong for the little ones you got this!
j5ajl3,Oh geez, I am so so sorry. I went through something similar, and it‚Äôs devastating. His behavior is not ok and absolutely not a reflection on you. Every situation is different, but I have to go with r/relationships‚Äô typical advice on this one and say to leave. He does not respect you. He does not honor your marriage. He does not hold dear to the fact you are the mother to his children. Please, keep reading that. I‚Äôm typically all for working it out and counseling, but there is a point for everyone where they are past the point of no return, and it is up to you to map that out for you and your relationship. You will not end up alone, you will find love again, but most importantly-you will get through this and be a strong mother to your children, no matter what.
j5ajl3,Do you want your son to grow up thinking that it's okay to treat his wife/husband the way that his father is treating you? This is his example, this is what you'll be teaching him. Are you okay with that? Good Luck to you-
j5ajl3,It never ceases to amaze me how a cheating piece of scum will deny and lie despite sound evidence proving that they cheated. Fuck this looser, he doesn‚Äôt deserve you or your kids. He didn‚Äôt give you guys a second thought when he having fun.
j5ajl3,Don't let your son be the only thing keeping you with a cheater- children living with toxic relationships dont do well. You're a mom, you know they see more than we expect them to. The fact that hes denying things doesn't bode well- theres likely more,  and even if there isn't, hes not willing to take responsibility, the first step in fixing these issues. If you truly believe you both can fix it, great- give it a shot, with therapy. If not, don't let this teach your son that the way to treat his future partner is with disrespect and cheating, or to allow a partner to do that to him. Model what you'd want him, and you're unborn baby, to do.I'm so sorry. You dont deserve this at all
j5ajl3,Don't hurt your son by letting him grow up under parents who should be divorced, in a home with a loveless, trust-less marriage.
j5ajl3,I think the idea of fixing this and moving forward would only be possible if he took full ownership.He isn‚Äôt.I say do a counseling appointment to discuss this with a mediator but don‚Äôt make any quick decisions til after that discussion.
nuit3b,The problem is honestly your husband, who was somehow unable to communicate to his family.The doctors are going to get it. The mother in law is self absorbed.
nuit3b,I'm finding it hard to blame the MIL because OPs husband went out of his way to not give her info about OPs schedule. He even told her they would be there. He sounds like he has quite a few resentments about OPs line of work and is very passive aggressive in how he takes them out on OP
nuit3b,Some thoughts:Your partner threw you under the bus by saying "we will be there," not communicating straightforwardly with his mom, and not addressing her entitlement. As a result, you are now the bad guy.Does mom tend to be controlling? Do she and the rest of his family make demands on your time and put a lot of stock into performative gestures? Does your husband often avoid conflict with his mother?There's a lot of projection and blame coming your way. It feels to me like this actually isn't about you (you're the scapegoat here) and is more to do with mom's need for control and your husband's compliant dynamics with her. Like the fact that he tried to weasel out of saying "she can't come" and then he didn't just say "she's working again tomorrow and can't make it" at the door makes me think he's trying to avoid conflict with his mama and is passing it to you. Don't let him do it!
nuit3b,His mom is honestly a super nice person and really not controlling at all.  She sent him the text because she worries that if she sent it to me that I would get angry.  But at the same time she had to know that he would tell me.  His parents have been told repeatedly that they need to check with us first before making plans because our schedules are atypical, but they kind of live in their own little world and operate under the assumption that I have an 8-5 job regardless of how many times we've told them that I don't.  My husband doesn't handle conflict or upset people well.  This is the reason that I'm the one who disputes incorrect charges and bills, because he doesn't argue.
nuit3b,Your husband set you up for failure.Does he know so little about your schedule that he wouldn't know you were also working an 11 hour day on Friday?The "We will be there" the first time set them up for disappointment, and an unexpected change (from their perspective) and then if he said anything but "that won't work for her" or "I'll let her know but I think she's really busy tomorrow to" when his mom told him to tell you to drop in on Friday, he also set you both up again. He set them up with false expectations for you and for you to fail.I'd talk to your husband. If he's conflict avoidant, the best thing to do is to clearly communicate before a situation to avoid conflict, rather than create one and shove it off on you.In a perfect world, he should apologize to his sister and mother for not communicating your schedule better. And you.  Since it's not, like another commenter suggested, reaching out to your SIL to apologize for not being able to make it work to see them (not for not seeing them, but for not being able to adjust your schedule last minute), let them know how much heads up you do need next time and suggest you both communicate directly instead of through intermediaries cus you would like to see them and meet their baby would be a nice gesture. And then tell your MIL (probably again) that you do value family but your job is important and you need more  of a heads up to make changes to your schedule.
nuit3b,I tell my husband my schedule, but he quickly forgets it.  So I have to remind him several times a week and day where I am, how long my drive is, how long the visit is, and when to expect me home.  So I'm not surprised that he wouldn't recall what my schedule was when his mom told him that.  I already sent a text to my SIL saying sorry I wasn't able to see them when they were here but I found out last minute and didn't have enough time to rearrange my schedule.  I told her that I'd love to see all of them next time they're here and to send me the dates when she knows them.  I haven't gotten a response yet, but hopefully that works.  Beyond that I'm kind of at a loss for anything else I can do.
nuit3b,I wouldn't be able to make a family arrangement like that on 24 hour notice either - if it's not for an emergency, it's not a reasonable expectation. I think both your husband and mother in law are at fault here. Your husband should have been clearer with his family at the start that you were apologetic but weren't going to be able to make it. And either way, your mother in law is pretty out of line in suggesting that you're 'ignoring' your new niece/nephew simply because you can't drop everything to reschedule.If you feel like it in your own right, I think it would be perfectly fine to send a simple text to your sister in law saying that you're sorry you missed them and you hope to be able to see them next time they're in town. You don't need to explain more than that - she knows perfectly well herself that she and her husband didn't contact you directly with advance notice either - if it was so important for them that they see you, they could have reached out themselves!As for your mother in law... I'd probably not contact her directly. Tell your husband that you feel like your time is not being taken seriously and that you expect him to defend you to his family, not to hang you out to dry. But I doubt there's anything to be gained from a back and forth with his mother in law. If she wants to be passive-aggressive and pass messages through your husband, you don't need to respond to her shit. She'll get over it - or ideally, your husband will stop funneling her passive aggression through to you and take responsibility for managing his own family's expectations, instead of passing their unreasonable demands on to you.
nuit3b,First off, stop talking about all of this over text.From there, contact SIL and BIL and say you want to chat. Own that you did not take responsibility for contacting them directly and that you instead used all of these different intermediaries (your husband, MIL, etc.). They did too, of course, but you don't need to mention that. Say you were only given two days notice that they were in town. Say you would have loved to see them, explain about your schedule, ask them to please give you some notice next time they will be in town and say you'd love to spend some time with them and/or plan something. It doesn't need to be a long explanation, for them "I can't take time off without at least X days notice without significant disruptions to patient care" should suffice. Suggest a virtual hang out soon. Say you'd like to stay in better touch so that these visits aren't such as surprise. Ask questions about baby. See how they respond. Chances are high they either don't care or will be able to recognize they should have given you more notice rather than go through MIL.Second, invite MIL to dinner or wait until the next time you see her in-person. Say you understand that feelings were hurt. Explain about your schedule and tell her what you need in the future to be able to make events (such as notice).  Be clear that two days is simply never going to be enough notice for you. Do not apologize to her for not calling out or changing your work schedule (that would be unreasonable). Merely focus on what you can do and what she can do in the future to prevent this from happening again. If that conversation is going well, you can suggest that your feelings were hurt since it seemed like she didn't respect you or your schedule. But only do that if the conversation is going well. If MIL still seems like she is making it all about her or stirring shit, just set firm boundaries. Let her know that if she is upset with you about something in the future you'd prefer she come to you and talk about it directly. Then leave it alone.If she's still upset or being unreasonable that's on her. Give her space to work through her feelings and stop trying to fix from there.But with a family that doesn't communicate well or plan (hence the last minute visit and the way things were conveyed or not conveyed in a timely fashion) you're going to want to prioritize clear and direct communication that much more. So doing it over text opens up all sorts of possibilities for misunderstandings. Just focus on how to ensure you see the baby next time rather than re-hashing what you did or didn't do or what they did or didn't do.
nuit3b,This is exactly what I was going to comment, particularly that you should stop texting about it. Sometimes managing conflict over text is useful because you have time to type out what you're thinking, but in this case it's doing more harm than good.You haven't done anything wrong - 24hrs is just not enough notice to cancel work commitments.
nuit3b,Was looking for this comment.  Stop texting and communicate directly with each other.
nuit3b,Agreed, this story has WAY too many texts and "so-and-so told such-and-such to pass this message on to someone-or-another." Take the bull by the horns, figure out what's going on, and clear the air.
nuit3b,Many people have mentioned the fact that so many texts were exchanged.¬† I do understand the issues that arise from relying on texting as the main form of communication.¬† You lose vocal inflection, can‚Äôt have an actual conversation, etc.¬† The reason that we use texts messages so much is because it is the most reliable way to get ahold of anyone in this family.¬† SIL and BIL have differing schedules so you have to reach out to them via text if you need to get ahold of them.¬† MIL doesn‚Äôt answer her phone most of the time when you call, but she responds to text messages.¬† I do agree that many of these things could be done via direct communication.¬†However, if I want to get ahold of them and actually have a conversation, it‚Äôs much more likely to occur via text than voice.
nuit3b,This a good and mature way to handle it OP!
nuit3b,Should be  your husband dealing with them.  They are his family so he knows what to do.  He was the big failure at this point because he didn't emphasize how difficult it is to change  your schedule and it sounds like he threw you under the bus.They sound very full of themselves and entitled to everyone else's free time on short notice.
nuit3b,I don‚Äôt believe your BIL is hurt.  I think your MIL is pissed that you‚Äôre not dancing to her tune.  Text your BIL a brief apology and let it go.
nuit3b,Agree. Also, the baby will not remember if anyone was there to see them as a newborn. That's a ridiculous thought. This is really on the husband, though. He should not ever make her choose between work obligations and extended family. OP needs to set very clear boundaries about when she can reschedule patients and how this is not an emergency in any way.
nuit3b,This isn‚Äôt high enough. All the drama leading up to and coming after is coming from MIL. Send BIL and SIL a text with a brief apology and offer to FaceTime whenever you are all free again. And if you feel terrible (which you shouldn‚Äôt, at all) then send a gift for the baby!
jxue7u,You feel confident and happy but I suspect you feel these externally. My ex believed she was confident, happy, attractive, yet she was horribly, destructively jealous. She was even jealous and insecure when my sisters would text me. The issue started to be resolved when she realized that she actually didn't have her own self-confidence or self-love: she was so accustomed to other people hyping her up (because she is gorgeous and brilliant and fun), yet she didn't know how to do that for herself, so any time she wasn't the center of my attention (like if I hung out with even a guy friend), she would become jealous and insecure.Once we realized this, she started to address these feelings of jealousy by reassuring herself. She'd think "I'm feeling jealous, but there's no reason for it, it's my own insecurity." She would then say affirmations to herself such as "I am enough. I am happy. I'm glad throwaway4rltnshp is hanging out with friends." She'd even say things like "I love myself. I am confident. throwaway4rltnshp loves me. I am so happy!" Doing these each time she experienced jealously started to turn the tables very quickly, to where she was even happy if she saw a girl checking me out (which formerly would have triggered an apocalyptic fight, because how dare I receive attention from a girl I don't even know exists?)I think you are on a good track because you have recognized the issue and you are determined to overcome it. The more you show yourself that nothing external defines the way you feel, the easier it will be.Edit: thanks for the silver my beautiful benefactor, whoever you are!
jxue7u,Great advice , love it.Forcefully rewiring insecurities into feeling of hope and self love until it stick.With how our brain work , it should work quite easily.I make use of this and strangely enough , it can rewire fear and anxiety into a strange feeling of excitation even when your whole world burn around you.The feeling that you know who you are , that you are strong enough to care and let go at the same time.It turn fear into a challenge. A challenge into a mastery.When you master your fear , you are emotionally unstoppable.Thats how i work my 6 years old son.Shit make you anxious son ? we will rewire you until the anxiety turn into excitement , excitement into learning opportunity and learning opportunity into success.From that success , the anxiety will transform itself into opportunities and growth.I cannot remove my son natural anxiety but i prove him and myself that we can rewire the impulse to leverage our weakness and turn us into a god damn power house.
jxue7u,Man I‚Äôve been in that type of relationship too many times, but unfortunately it never ended like your story. Life woulda been pretty different if it had.
jxue7u,I come here for the drama and I have to say this comment actually might have been the advice I didn't know I needed to hear. Thank you!
jxue7u,she was so accustomed to other people hyping her up (because she is gorgeous and brilliant and fun), yet she didn't know how to do that for herself, so any time she wasn't the center of my attention (like if I hung out with even a guy friend), she would become jealous and insecureWow. You just pinpointed the heart of my insecurity. Thank you for writing this comment. I know it was for OP but I want you to know you really helped me and probably other people reading this as well.
jxue7u,I wish my ex could come to terms with this and confront his issues. Now I have to give him up and it‚Äôs breaking our hearts
jxue7u,This was really encouraging to read; even vicariously- it helped me more than any time I've been directly given advice.I think maybe there are unintentional undertones present when giving advice in these situations if the person asking is male.  It's also cool you didn't talk to her like a "nice girl", I'm not trying to make this a gender/"poor men" thing.It's just cool to see people on reddit trying to support people asking for help when they're admitting that they're the problem in their life, and not just screaming about how they deserve it because they're the problem.The more I try and work on myself, the more it becomes clear that people usually want to give someone a taste of their own medicine first, before helping, if someone gives the impression they were toxic.   Which makes sense, I guess.
jxue7u,To go off this, I have anxiety which go hand in hand with insecurities. Mine isn‚Äôt related to significant others but my therapist taught me to think through my fear. Okay, I‚Äôm nervous about my boyfriend is with other girls, what can I do about this? Why am I thinking this. Complete the thought don‚Äôt just think ‚Äúoh no! Oh no! Oh no!‚Äù Think it through to the end. All the way. Then move on. Also, deep breaths. Sounds dumb but six deep inhales, hold for six, exhale for six six times will calm you down.Look into therapy also and actually price it out. It‚Äôs not as expensive as you think. If you have insurance it‚Äôs like $50. Good luck!
jxue7u,Yes I love this comment! I find I'm also a bit jealous of friendships and it's because I'm insecure about myself. I told my SO this and we communicated and what that this was build trust. Now when I start to feel these smaller thoughts, I have to remind myself and tell myself I'm just being insecure.
jxue7u,These are the kinds of tips my therapist gave to me when I was really struggling with my body image.
jxue7u,Thank you for this advice. I am in the same boat and know that I have things to work on but sometimes it's hard to figure out where to start.
jxue7u,Wow you are a Gray catch to recognize these issues and work through them with her and have the patience for that
jxue7u,Totally agree with this. It starts with training yourself not to be. Taking the first step/s to become a better person. Really good on (OP) to have that much self-awareness. That means she already has what it takes to become better.My advice, as I am going through something myself, is to start with working on your own concentration/focus/attention. That way, when you start realizing that you are again feeling the negative vibes within you, you can do so with ease when you have mastered your own ability to focus.As OP commenter has mentioned, telling yourself on a regular basis the things they mentioned can be really helpful in shaping your whole mindset. Stop believing people that say that optimism can only take you so far. That is not true. The moment you start believing that you are something, is the moment you really start evolving.You can do it. Don't lose hope and don't lose yourself. Just be patient. Don't get frustrated. It can take you weeks and even months, but what's important is that you get there.
jxue7u,To add on to this, if you are working on how this worrying feels compulsive or hard to stop, I‚Äôve had good results with the workbook ‚ÄúWhat, Me, Worry?‚Äù It‚Äôs 10 chapters, and does a lot to help you figure out your beliefs about worrying and practice redirecting your thoughts.
jxue7u,How'd she cope when you broke up?
niaodc,I am going to have some dark horse advice here.You have gone through a terrible loss. You have ten thousand reasons to be upset even without your friend making this insane choice. I don't know what she's thinking, I have to imagine there are elements to this situation that you don't know as of yet, but it doesn't matter. There's nothing to win here. You don't win by telling her how sad and upset you are; that doesn't fix anything. It won't make her be your MOH again, and it won't fix the friendship because the glaring fact that she's ditching you will still be true. And provided there IS something deeper here, some unknown element keeping her away, she's just going to get upset and more distant. The end of the day has the facts being what they are; she's not coming, you're still marrying your love, the show must go on.My vote would be that, right now, it isn't worth the emotional energy required to unfuck this. You can just let it go for now. Focus on your husband, focus on the wedding, focus on the people who are there to love and support you. Put her nonsense on a shelf. If you still care about it later, you can talk it out when things aren't so important. But you may find that this is just a limp, boring end to a relationship instead of a flashy one. Maybe when it is said and done you don't really want to fix this all that much anyway. Maybe the boring truth is that she's self-involved and kind of terrible and you won't be so mad that it worked out that way. Or, you know, you sit down and talk it out and cry and bond later when the stakes are lower and it works out great. Who knows?But it just doesn't seem like where you need to put your energy right now, right at this moment, since everything else in your life is more important than a friend who can't figure out how to say, "Pick literally any other weekend".
niaodc,I really appreciate your words. I think you're right - I just need to shelve this for now. Not even try to deal with it quite yet.
niaodc,Bravo...this is one of the most well thought out and mature responses to a post on this sub I've ever seen.Kudos.
niaodc,This actually sounds like the best plan. Forget the friend for now, deal with your own stuff and see what the future brings.
niaodc,Agreed, this might be the beginning of the end. Or it might be a pivotal moment in this friendship where you just don‚Äôt rely on her the same way you used to. Maybe she just becomes a friend who you have lower expectations for and see her when it‚Äôs convenient, but don‚Äôt go out of your way for her. It‚Äôs ok to have friendships like that.ETA: Sometimes people show you who they are and you just have to believe them.
niaodc,I do want to just point out, that as far as the why, it seems OP didn‚Äôt update her friend on anything other than the pregnancy isn‚Äôt viable. Everyone handles grief in different ways, everyone handles miscarriages differently, and since her friend told her she wasn‚Äôt coming before OP mentioned the hospital or the miscarriage, it‚Äôs possible she is truly doing what‚Äôs best for her and her relationship, because it‚Äôs very possible her partner is going through a similar feeling of loss that OP is with the relative, except it‚Äôs more a priority to be there for a partner than a friend. Much like if OP‚Äôs husband left to comfort a friend than his wife, that‚Äôd be inexcusable. It doesn‚Äôt change OP being hurt or feeling left alone, but shelving this and focusing on her immediate family is really the move here for now. Her husband should be supporting OP and if OP needs additional support, therapy might be a great move too.
niaodc,This is actually really great advice.
niaodc,This is sensible advice.I was going to tell OP that this is a self-involved person who is not worth hanging on to, and to just let her go. I think the way you put it is more balanced.
niaodc,Yesss. ....This, she seems to have a pattern of letting you down, and you seem to have a pattern of being there for her when she needs you.  You may want to either let her go (eventually) or at go low contact.My condolences üåπ Please take good care of yourself, be gentle,  this too shall pass.
niaodc,First, I am so sorry for your loss and the additional stress you are going through during an already difficult time.I disagree with this advice, however. I think if this relationship is important to you (and it sounds like it might be since you chose this person to be your MoH) it‚Äòs worth an honest conversation.It‚Äôs 100% shitty for her to flake on your wedding for a stranger‚Äôs birthday party. It‚Äôs 100% shitty for her to not be there for you during your miscarriage. And when we value relationships, we communicate honestly. She also deserves to know this is a huge disappointment because if she doesn‚Äôt know, she can‚Äôt do better.Absolutely she should have not acted shittily in the first place, but if this is a person you want to continue having a close relationship with, you may need to give her another chance to step up and be there for you and then reassess.If this is not a relationship you feel you can put the energy into or don‚Äôt want to put the energy into, then that‚Äôs a different story.
niaodc,Solid, rational advice!
niaodc,This is great advice
niaodc,This is EXCELLENT advice.  One of the many reasons I love Reddit.
niaodc,This might be good advice for some people but it might be really poor advice for others. Shelving an emotional or interpersonal problem just doesn't work well for everyone. Not addressing it right away can allow a lot of time for resentment to fester if OP is prone to that, and it might lead to a bigger blow up later. OP only you know whether you're the kind who can let it go and to cool off over time or the kind to dwell and let the pressure build until it explodes. If you're the latter, don't wait.I also had my MOH back out of my wedding for incomprehensible reasons and it was really horrible. I couldn't stop thinking about the situation for weeks and not understanding exactly why it was happening only fed into my growing resentment. If I hadn't cleared the air, it may have tainted my whole experience. Thankfully, I was able to work through it and resolve the situation sufficiently that I could focus on the things that really mattered.
niaodc,Yes I think explains the exact relationship I have with my wife right now. I know her situations and I will bend over backwards to help her out and make her life better at my own expense. She however can‚Äôt see the forest for the trees. She only focuses on what she wants and if I need anything I actually have to tell her this is what I want. Not really a good relationship, I know. But it is what it is. This girls best friend is so self involved that she cannot see any other situation other than what‚Äôs going on in her life. It‚Äôs better for this to happen now than later. Either get over it and stay friends or drift away. Either way it‚Äôll all be OK
niaodc,I agree with this. If she doesn't want to be there for you, let her fuck off.
niaodc,This happened to me in a lesser version. During nursing school I was fairly close to one of my classmates, we hung out a lot, did study groups, I went to her wedding etc. I finished on time but she dumped her final project and had to redo, which coincided roughly with my wedding. By that time I was realizing that she was kind of a coaster with some moochy qualities. The day before my wedding she texted me to say that she was behind on her project and would come to the ceremony but not the reception. Then she just didn‚Äôt show up at all. I was miffed but not heartbroken, and decided that the ball was in her court, after that display of tackiness she needed to be the one to reach out. I never heard from her again.
niaodc,So my sister got married a few years back. I bet money that the MOH would ditch the wedding. Told my Aunt(practically my mum at the time) 6 months before the wedding yea she wont show. So I prepared a speech and everything just in case. 2 days before the wedding we get "Sorry my son is sick so I cant fly down" I dont believe she ever booked the flights. People like that are unreliable, we call them fair weather friends. If the weather is good or they need something they are totally available, but stormy situations they are gone.But heres the legit amazing part, someone my sister didnt even consider to put on the bridal party who had helped with every part of that wedding planning got to be a part of the main event now. We were all so happy to have this lady step into that role 2 days before the wedding it was amazing!Have a look around OP find someone amazing in your life already who does show up, does care about you and legit nothing stopping you having a young family member or even an older one be there for you. I've seen Grandmothers do it and Young nieces.Who in your life matters to you :)Good luck and sorry for your loss
niaodc,Great advice. I hope OP has someone in her life who shows up better than this friend. My best friend got married 2000 miles away and I would've driven all night, hitchhiked, or generally clawed my way out there to be at that wedding if necessary.
niaodc,This is great advice. I great friend of mine from HS, college, and after was getting married. We had drifted apart just from not socializing. Well, one of her bridesmaid  had a terrible falling out close to the wedding. She called me up, and we rekindled the relationship since then.
iiq2im,Ick, who would want to stay with their ex and his next in an apartment, even a bigger one. Talk to your lawyer and let them know that your ex has changed the terms to something you're not willing to do.Also, offering the mil quarters for his use to visit is a reasonable compromise
iiq2im,Yeah, the situation is not ideal. The only thing I‚Äôm not looking forward to is paying the lawyer more money when I felt like all of the tedious stuff with the divorce was over. Plus, my ex has a temper, so he‚Äôll throw a fit I‚Äôm sure.Yeah, the mil quarters is great. He can come see his son and neither of us have to see each other
iiq2im,Stop over thinking. Talk to a lawyer. This matter is not a insignificant.. One time thing... You have to live with this arrangement for a long time. Fix it before you get in a mess. Lawyer is what you need rn... Something like that
iiq2im,Have it changed to where the husband has to come to you or pay for the hotel for you.
iiq2im,He can come to me anytime, but he hasn‚Äôt this whole time. I highly doubt he‚Äôll be willing to cover a hotel stay for me. He doesn‚Äôt even like to pay the small amount of child support he pays.
iiq2im,If the judge signs things, you're actually golden. Your court-mandated 2 week stays in Ontario will take place -- you can have as much documentation (receipts, video diaries) as you like.If he doesn't show up, that's his business.Also, I'd fight the $100/month if he starts complaining.
iiq2im,I‚Äôd be shocked if the court signs the $100 per month.  That sound like it‚Äôs FAR less than would be mandated by the calculators, and courts are reluctant to approve those types of agreements.
iiq2im,This is the right answer - if the contract says Ontario, then Ontario it is. Ex husband can foot whatever bill he need to.
iiq2im,Talk to your lawyer and find out your options.   It doesn't really matter what he wants in the end.  Talk to your lawyer and get the facts.
iiq2im,Jesus who's downvoting these comments? Child support should range between 300-800 per child depending on the fathers income. It costs way more than 100 to raise a kid per month.
iiq2im,Whenever I‚Äôd tell him that $100/month was unacceptable, he‚Äôd threaten to try and gain custody. I‚Äôm hoping that the judge will order him to pay the proper amount.There has been a lot intimidation. I cannot afford a court battle, which was on the table when my ex wasn‚Äôt getting his way during negotiations. I was a stay at home mom when we were together, so my son and I left with nothing. My family has been covering my court costs. My family has no problem covering costs, so we aren‚Äôt struggling and I plan to go back to college to get a degree so that I can be self-sufficient.The whole thing is a mess, but my son hasn‚Äôt been affected too much by all of this.
iiq2im,$100/month is enough for groceries for a kid, if that. This is way too little of an amount
iiq2im,100$ a month... that can't even pay for the food of a neglected dog...He agreed of her getting full custody and essentially sold her her son for the privilege to be a deadbeat dad...And he's physically abusive, that's the cherry on top of this shit cake.OP have all this explained to the judge and have your lawyer hit him with everything he's got.That pregnant next has some idea of what she's getting into and run for the hills just by witnessing this shit.
iiq2im,Can I ask:- Do you have any proof / recordings of him threatening to disappear with your son?- Is your ex just using custody as a sword over your head? ie. does he actually care for or love your son (to the point that he would put your son's welfare above his own?) - be honestBecause, seriously, why would you want your son to continue interacting with a man like that? A father figure? Sometimes a missing parent is better than a horrible one.He's already determined to be as difficult as possible and is expecting you to accommodate the whims of the mistress (sorry, that's what she is) and him.So:You are the bigger person already.You don't need to prove anything by giving them anything they want.Put YOURSELF and your son first. Get your defences up, you need a lawyer, and you need to document everything.I don't know the law, but you don't have to give in to him on anything - custody, child support, etc. Especially if you have evidence of him threatening to kidnap your child as a bargaining stick... he can be held responsible for yours and your son's financial support without having the privilege of seeing his son.He chose to have the child, so he's responsible. He is also choosing to be a horrible person by threatening to kidnap the boy, amongst other things, and he's also responsible for the consequences of his actions if the law decides that the child isn't safe with him at all...
iiq2im,A missing parent Sometimes is wayyy better than a bad parent present. That's a very important point. It was hard for me growing up without a dad but now that I'm old enough to know better, I'm glad he wasn't in my life. Probably would have messed me up. Lol
iiq2im,Hold up ‚Äî did you have a canadian or American lawyer to start? Do you have an American lawyer now?This man was physically AND emotionally abusive to you and 1) your lawyer let him bully you into only getting fully custody if you agreed to only $100 CAD I'm assuming monthly in child support, and 2) his girlfriend is already pregnant before your divorce is even filed and 3.) He's now trying to make you pay to be further inconvenienced by his gross ass? Before the papers are even signed??What the actual fuck is your lawyer doing, sleeping???Tell the lawyer you can no longer accept the conditions, he's uncooperative, he moved provinces and is changing the expectations and that you are demanding full custody AND proper child support. Also he's threatened to KIDNAP YOUR CHILD. Stay in the U.S. and don't allow visitation holy hell. Does your lawyer not know all this???
iiq2im,Tell him straight up: You do what you *originally* agreed to or I take you to court for everything and you will pay court ordered child support. It will be taken directly from your paycheck. You will pay *me* for the the privilege of playing house with your girlfriend. He is the person who is changing your agreement at the last second. He must pay for that financially.  Say that and then block him for two days. You are back with your family now if he wants to emotionally or physically abuse you he must drive to do it.All of the other issues about the reasons for your break up are side issues. This man is the kind of asshole that changes agreements at the last second when you are bending over backwards to accommodate him?I edited this to add: He's already signed the agreement and it's in front of the judge. This means that the judge is going to sign off on it. The original agreement is what the court will be ordering you to do. You don't have to do anything outside of the court order. He has no outside authority to make you do any bullshit that he asks you to do.  You can just block him and bring the son for the visitation as agreed to. No one will be able to compel you to do otherwise. Tell him you're following all court orders and have no flexibility for anything else. If he doesn't like it he can take you back to court and you'll ask for more money.
iiq2im,That he threatened to KIDNAP their child and physically abused her is not a side issue it's reason why she shouldn't let him anywhere near their kid and should have to negotiate for full custody and no visitation.
iiq2im,It sounds like he made a bargain about Ontario, but now wants to go back on his end of the bargain.You have a strong bargaining position. You live a long ways away with the child, and in a completely different country. If you don't participate in custodial visits, I'm not sure what he'd be able to do about that, exactly.
iiq2im,You seem to be letting him dictate what is going to happen. Stop giving him all the power. What do you want? What is best for your child. Who cares what he wants to do. Have your lawyer counter with other terms.
iiq2im,OP you need to go back to court. Ask for more money for your son. $100 is literally nothing and it will be even less than that if he is paying $100 CAD. That will barely cover groceries for your son.Also, it's their choice to move to New Bruinswick. Get a new agreement where the dad has to pick your son up.I don't blame you for not wanting to stay with them. That would be awkward and likely problems would sprout up.Or you can drop your son off at the border and have dad meet him there.I'm so sorry you are having to deal with this OP. But if it's already in the agreement that you live in the states and he lives in Canada,  then I don't see how he can say you are running off with your son.It's documented that this is the arrangement . So ita not like you are changing plans.
lwcrx3,Am I a total asshole for even trying to set boundaries?No, it would be worse if you didn't!  She needs to find another person to vent to for both of your sakes!  My wife is like that too, but she spreads it around.  Me, her mom, her coworkers, her friends, etc.I hear you on the "that sounds really hard" thing, though!  I usually go with "that sucks."
lwcrx3,This is precisely how I deal with my husband. We both have ADHD, so we've learned to accommodate each other. He understands I can't just sit still and listen and I get that sometimes he can't stop talking. If he's really unloading, I listen to him while doing something fun but not too mentally challenging, like online shopping or playing casual games.
lwcrx3,this is very sweet :) my mom used to do this if we were telling her things, she would be doing chores or whatever and we'd just follow her around and chat.i don't mind being talked at if someone is sharing their thoughts and experiences, but i do mind having someone's emotional mess dumped on me. and i understand OP's frustration with his partner never taking responsibility to change or fix it, and getting stuck in negative cycles. i don't think it's helpful for the venter, either, to get stuck in that habit of dwelling in the negativity all the time.
lwcrx3,Perfect suggestion, this is absolutely what I do. Sure keep talking but you‚Äôll have to come to the kitchen with me while I do dishes. Sometimes even gets him into productivity mode too
lwcrx3,She needs a therapist.I'm also a verbal processor and when I'm going through something difficult (like it sounds like your wife is with work), I get a therapist using Better Help so that I can voice memo, talk and text my therapist and dump on someone who is trained/paid to help me process, rather than overburdening my partner.
lwcrx3,I'm not joking, but she is a counselor. I've gently suggested therapy many times over the years. Right now the response I get is that no one is taking new patients.
lwcrx3,a good cue for me to journal or save for therapy is if i am pre-empting analysis a lot in my speech...pretty good indication I'm not looking for constructive advice at that point and better to develop my thoughts privately or with a counselor until I am
lwcrx3,Would you recommend Better Help to a broke college student?
lwcrx3,Better Helpcan I ask, how much does it cost on Better Help just to have a therapist you can text and occasionally call?
lwcrx3,What is "Better Help"?
lwcrx3,Interrupt her. She knows that she's dumping on you too much because you've tried to set this boundary repeatedly, so it won't come as a shock. Go ahead and say, "I am really and truly at capacity for venting, and I need us to talk about something else now." Keep that line, even if she tries to brush you off.
lwcrx3,I agree with this. I also have a tendency to get into rant mode if I've had a bad day at work or got wound up about something and working from home my partners definitely had to put up with a bit more. He'll let me talk about it and engage but if I start repeating myself, talking over him or just generally get increasingly annoyed he'll in a nice way be like "you've stressed yourself out enough, let's go for a walk / make dinner/ watch something instead".I genuinely need the interruption and distraction or I just get more and more wound up. OPs partner should have the self awareness to know she does this and take the feedback if she's going over the top.
lwcrx3,As a verbal processor myself, please do not simply interrupt her.I have found that when I find myself dumping verbally, the best thing is for my partner to give me a physical cue letting me know I am dumping. It doesn‚Äôt interrupt, but it gives a heads up.Part of the verbal processing is just that - processing. We get caught up in it, usually as a result of anxiety and a need to get out everything we‚Äôve been holding in all day. Getting interrupted mid-sentence, no matter how annoying we may be, can be heart-wrenching and cause more anxiety.
lwcrx3,Sorry for the super long post... my first time commenting but relate a lot to your wife‚Äôs side of this! I have a few questions - when does she speak/vent to you? Is she asking for advice or always just venting? Are you WFH together? If she can‚Äôt get a therapist as others suggest...My advice if you are both WFH and she is interrupting you would be to gently communicate and have a conversation to let her know that in order to get your work done you need some alone time and to set physical boundaries e.g close the door, so that she knows okay, when the door is closed I can‚Äôt come and vent. If she still interrupts you, interrupt her and ask ‚Äòcan we do this later‚Äô and gently explain you are busy/can‚Äôt break off. Make excuses kindly and truthfully, speak to her when you can but make sure she knows, you are not always available.We also have a new ‚Äòno work talk after dinner‚Äô rule (my partner‚Äôs suggestion), suggested by him as being something to reduce both our stress levels and preserve some wind down time (and it has!). Not sure of your schedules but is this something that could work for you?I partly speak to my partner so much because I look to him for advice and can get very anxious if I‚Äôm not able to do this (obviously my issue, not his). If she isn‚Äôt happy with your responses, she needs to make clearer when she just wants you to listen and when she is asking you for your help/thoughts so you can respond appropriately. I think you can ask her to do this. She needs to prioritise speaking to you about the latter as you only have brain space for so much. If, as someone else suggested, you can make specific times and spaces for her letting off steam, she should also be able to prioritise what she really wants to get off her chest, and shelve the other stuff - if she knows she only has a window, she‚Äôs got to filter!If she‚Äôs not looking for advice or you feel these things won‚Äôt work, or it‚Äôs a constant stream of negativity, as a short term solution perhaps you could position a conversation that you are finding the pandemic situation difficult in some ways and it‚Äôs important for your own well-being that you are able to focus on the positives and that a greater emphasis on this in your interactions with each other in terms of % happy/sad topics of conversation would be helpful if possible.Depends on what kind of person she is/how seriously her job is affecting her as to how this would go down and but an ex of mine used to jokeily make me do ‚Äòtwo stars and a wish‚Äô about my day, lol. He‚Äôd ask me once I‚Äôd finished the first part of my rant but before I got really into it. Corny and for children, but made me reflect, prioritise and then shut up - as well as making me realise how much I must have been complaining. Good luck! Just make sure she knows she can still approach you for emotional support/help with problems when she really needs to.
lwcrx3,This is a great post for your first comment!!! Welcome to commenting reddit. You may sometimes receive rude replies if you comment more often, so I'm filling this reply with love and praise and hope you comment more because this imo is good advice.
lwcrx3,She can talk into an ‚Äúempty‚Äù phone while on a walk alone. It is surprisingly effective. No one will notice and she gets the exact same benefit as venting to an overloaded human.
lwcrx3,I had a similar suggestion, but about doing a video journal lol. I do find it effective lmao. I've done it a few times when I'm really wound up. The idea of doing it like a phone call never occurred to me! But basically in the end it's all the same thing: talking to yourself. XD I used to do it all the time when I was younger, idk why I really stopped, because I probably need it now more than ever lmao.
lwcrx3,I love this idea so much.
lwcrx3,This year of WFH and closeness has been tough on both verbal processing types and their partners. I wonder if she‚Äôd be open to journaling?  That in addition to certain hours where you are ‚Äúopen to listen‚Äù. I was having a hard time about 11 months ago and talking at my husband way too much. Those two tools - journal and ‚Äúoffice hours‚Äù helped mightily. Plus the journal I wrote turned into an interesting project.
nf36de,Legally?  Not at all.Morally?  Maybe an occasional check in or something.  Daily care?  Absolutely not!
nf36de,My uninformed opinion- While this case is decided by court and social workers, the more hands-off OP should be in terms of giving care. For her sake and his. If he‚Äôs not at her place, the more help everyone will realize he needs. (If he is she may become the de facto person in charge.). Any precedent/ expectation that he‚Äôs cared for may make his case lower priority.
nf36de,Agree. This is it. There‚Äôs no real obligation here. But if it were me, I‚Äôd visit causally and just be kind. You don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúcare‚Äù for him, but act as a friend who visits him weekly or something of the sort. Do what feels good to you- if that‚Äôs casual once or twice a week visiting, that‚Äôs great. Under no circumstances are you responsible to change diapers, is all I‚Äôm saying. It‚Äôs an unfortunate and SHIT thing that happened to him, but he could‚Äôve been going anywhere- it‚Äôs not your fault.
nf36de,Jumping on this to also say for OP: maybe find some more level headed friends. Suggesting that you take on the role of financial support and caretaker for someone you don't really know well just because the accident tangentially involved you is silly. That's a huge responsibility and emotional drain. Being supportive definitely doesn't have to mean sacrificing yourself.
nf36de,I think this is great advice.
nf36de,Maybe your friends or mutual acquaintances could also coordinate a meals program or visiting program to keep his spirits up. I think nblackhand has it right.‚ÄôThe social worker will Be most important in getting safe discharge plan, when the time is right.
nf36de,This is precisely what OP should do. She has no moral obligation here, but she ought to keep being a friend, or even casual gf, to him, if she is fond of him. No reason to stop that.None of that means she needs to become his life partner or caregiver.
nf36de,If caretaking isn‚Äôt your thing, still continue your casual relationship.  It might be a little more difficult, but it‚Äôd help cut down his healing time and probably break up the monotony of lying in bed all day.  Maybe even offer to pick up medications or do some simple shopping on your way over.  He should be fine with disability and/or unemployment until he heals.Don‚Äôt create obligation for yourself where none exists, the same friends telling you you should are probably the first who would say ‚Äúno‚Äù if they had a similar situation.
nf36de,I agree with all of this. It's a tricky situation. I'm curious, what would you advise in terms of his living situation though? I can see why all eyes would turn to her for that, however unfair (and she definitely shouldn't take it on).ETA: Of course the legal stuff will eventually work it out, but once he gets discharged, that will be well before court proceedings get that fair most likely, he will need somewhere in the immediate future. Again, I'm not AT ALL advocating for OP to take it on, just curious how you think that should play out since your advice is so spot on.
nf36de,How did the accident happen? Is someone else at fault whose insurance will cover his care while he‚Äôs recuperating somewhere else?I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a moral obligation to care for him yourself. That‚Äôs not the type of relationship you had and it was a short term relationship. But if he‚Äôs alone in the world, it‚Äôs be nice if you helped make sure SOMEONE else was taking care of him somewhere.
nf36de,Elderly person with some type of dementia became confused while driving and hit him going the wrong way down a one way.It‚Äôs a difficult situation that‚Äôs still being sorted out. The driver had allowed their insurance to lapse but it‚Äôs unclear if they were functional enough to realize.Anyways ‚Äî the court appointed someone to handle this aspect of things and he is being adequately represented in the ongoing legal proceedings but once I confirmed that to be the Cass I was not involved in it at all from there.
nf36de,This is why it is so important to have a will and financial and medical power of attorneys- even if you‚Äôre young and especially if you don‚Äôt have someone who is the obvious (and legal- usually the next of kin unless you have already appointed someone power of attorney) person to step in and take on that responsibility.
nf36de,I don't know in what universe your friends live, but did they ever think more than a second about what this level of care means?I'm guessing you're not even educated as a nurse/caretaker. You would still need to work to even afford this, including equipment, remodelling of the apartment and likely a form of care taker. So in the best case this guy will slowly die of boredom due to being alone all the time, most likely you both will go insane due to the immense stress.Since you're a woman and hes a man, it likely hes heavier than you, so you can bearly help him when he falls and similar situations.Lastly, being very impaired and dependent can be ugly. Theres shit, blood and tears most of the time. It destroys you if you're not 100% on board with it.Help him get into a long term clinic / rehab and be a good friend and check on him, if you want to. Don't take him in when you are not remotly capable off doing so, physically financially and mentally.
nf36de,Is there a social worker assigned to his case? There have to be other options besides a friends with benefits.
nf36de,Yes, there should be someone at the hospital making sure he has someone to take care of him.
nf36de,Medical social worker here. This is the answer. If he truly has no family, the hospital social worker/case manager can assist in getting him to a skilled nursing facility for rehabilitation as well as to help with activities of daily living. They can also assess if he qualifies for medi-cal to help with any copays he may accrue at the SNF. The SNF social worker will then help with discharge planning back to the community, like making sure he has DMEs he may need, resources to caregiver agencies and etc, as well as refer to home health care for further rehabilitation and support at home. He won‚Äôt be thrown out of the hospital to fend for himself. At least he wouldn‚Äôt be if he had a good social worker.I‚Äôd recommend for OP to maybe help in advocating for what he needs, but I personally wouldn‚Äôt take responsibility for his day to day care.
nf36de,What is my responsibility here?I need someone totally emotionally detached from the situation to just give it to me in plain language. Thank you.tl;dr my non-serious boyfriend was severely injured in an auto accident on the way to visit me. He has no one to care for him through the recovery process and I‚Äôm wondering what my responsibility is here. I don‚Äôt really know him, but I know him more than anyone else in his life right now.You have no obligation whatsoever to either be his carer or to begin or continue a committed relationship with this man. Neither morally or legally. Especially not as a carer. This man is going to need physical therapy, talk therapy and domestic assistance, and these should be provided by professionals, not by you even if you decide to stay with him in some capacity. If you like you can be there for him, and that will probably be a very good thing for him, but you do not bear any burden personally to see to it that he's well taken care of. That responsibility falls to broader society and the health care system in particular.You also have no obligation whatsoever to stay in a relationship with him, or deepen your current relationship. If you want, you may ghost him tomorrow. It would be harsh on him, but you may have plenty of good reasons that fundamentally only you can judge.However, it seems from your post that you had an at least amicable relationship, so I don't think that that is exactly what you want to do. The bigger point is that his accident and injury has no bearing on your autonomy or boundaries. If you'd want to keep your relationship where it is: that's fine. If you want to break up with him later: that's fine. If you want to just be friends from now on: that's fine. And if he does not respect those boundaries and that makes you want to leave: that's fine.One thing I do recommend is that, if I'm reading your post right, and you do care about him in some capacity: express it. If you want to check in on him, try to make that appointment. Maybe bring him something to cheer him up. Such gestures never oblige you to any greater commitment, and you'll regret it long term if you don't express how you feel. It might feel as if you're headed for a serious relationship when you do those things, because that's how it happens in movies, but in reality it doesn't work like that. In reality such gestures merely express the current state of your feelings, and are not promises to hold future feelings or anything. The only gesture that can create a commitment is a promise and even that commitment is no bigger or smaller than the promise. If you can't promise to see him through his recovery, don't. Don't let worries about commitments hinder you from being honest, because honesty is what will prevent you from getting into commitments you can't keep.Nothing in the last paragraph is obligatory, just advisory.
nf36de,Do your friends think you're like... trapped in some kind of romantic drama?You're at best a casual friend to this dude. If you feel up to it, provide some emotional support; he could use friends and it doesn't sound like he has many. But ffs unless you're personally driven to be Florence Nightingale, don't commit to actual care-taking; the system, such as it is, will be more than happy to dump all the responsibility onto you as soon as you raise your hand.
nf36de,Or even wave your hand vaguely
nf36de,Several people here have mentioned social workers and I would like to second or third this idea. The hospital where he is will have social workers on staff and they can help him navigate through all of this. They have lots of contacts and resources to arrange care for patients and that is exactly why they are there.
nf36de,Many of my friends have suggested that because the accident happened while visiting me and because we were in a relationship of sorts, that I am responsible for seeing him through the recovery process.Would they be saying the same thing if this guy was your regular plumber or something?You are absolutely not "responsible" for seeing this guy through his recovery. If you want to do anything, visit him as a friend - if he's able to take visitors, I'm sure he'd appreciate a visit from someone who isn't a doctor or case worker. But no, he is not suddenly your lifelong husband and dependant.Though all that said, I am truly sorry for both of you to be in this situation. It sounds like an incredibly rough time.
nf36de,Regular plumber?I think she implied that he'd laid some pipe...
nf36de,Absolutely no commitment. He might also not particularly want a girl he banged for a month involved in his medical care anyway, even if he has no other friends or family. This is particularly important if any of the health problems mean that he is struggling to make his wishes known, because people will assume that you as his girlfriend will know him best and have his best interests at heart.
hoeaet,I think that's the part that bothers me the most... that he doesn't seem to care I'm hurt. I would support him if he was hurt regardless of how he got hurt. As far as him thinking he knows more than my doctor... so the other day he saw me getting out of the shower and obviously I wasn't wearing my boot because I was showering. Apparently me being able to stand in the shower and limp without it for a very short distance = me not needing it. Aka if it was a "serious" injury I wouldn't be able to walk on it. I do think he thinks of a fracture as less than a broken bone.
hoeaet,Hop away, STAY OFF YOUR FOOT.
hoeaet,I would really recommend reconsidering your relationship. I don't know if you plan to have kids, but picture yourself with stitches in your belly after a C-section, the day after. Your boyfriend refusing to help you. Saying you're the one who needed a C-section.Or, imagine you get in a car accident and break your back, or have mono, or the flu, or have cancer...imagine how he would act then. To me, that thought is very sad. A partner should absolutely help you and take care of you when you are injured or sick.He is showing you how he really is. Believe him.
hoeaet,I don't know if you plan to have kids, but picture yourself with stitches in your belly after a C-section, the day after. Your boyfriend refusing to help you."It's just a little incision, and the baby popped right out. I dunno why you're making such a big deal about it, it's not like you're bleeding all over the floor or anything. Besides, you got yourself into this mess by missing that pill. Now stop whining and make me dinner already."
hoeaet,Life‚Äôs too short for assholes that call you a liar for breaking your foot.
hoeaet,Just think about it: if he doesn‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre hurt over a broken bone, how‚Äôs he gonna act if you get pregnant? ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just making this morning sickness thing up, stop fake-puking every morning it‚Äôs gross‚Äù??Gotta think about these things. You want to be with someone that has your back.
hoeaet,Sounds like a shitty bf. My mans would never
hoeaet,But forreal girl get outta there! He should be worried about your foot :(
hoeaet,Red flag on red flag on a bed of red flags. His behaviour is disgusting and if he isn‚Äôt willing to help you and roll with the punches, kick him to curb. Maybe he‚Äôll fracture his foot and grow up ü§∑üèª
hoeaet,Watch carefully. He is giving you a window into how he'll treat every injury you have that he doesn't personally understand, every injury that "inconveniences" him or both.My mom does this and it drives me up a wall. So I know how it feels.A partner is someone who helps you when you're hurt, even if it's "your fault".I know everyone whines about reddit jumping to breaking up, but I would seriously be evaluating the relationship in your shoes, especially if you want a long-term relationship. Things happen in life. What if you got in an accident or really sick, and needed serious help? Would he help you, or would he be pissy and blame you?I'd sit him down and tell him something along the lines of: "I'm sorry our plans were cancelled but we can't change the past. I'm in pain and I need you to help me and respect me so that my injury doesn't get worse. If you can't move on from your disappointment and be helpful, I'll need to [rethink our relationship] [take a break] [leave]".Btw, I had an ankle injury a few years ago. They originally thought hairline fracture until a specialist determined it was a really bad sprain. Even with just a sprain, I had to wear a boot and get physical therapy- and even after that it wasn't the same for a long time. These injuries can and do get worse if you keep pushing yourself.
hoeaet,Exactly. I wonder what it would be like if someday I had a more serious injury or medical issue and it wasn't "my fault" like this was. Or if he's only acting this way because he thinks it was my fault. And I can definitely see how injuries get worse easily. My foot is only getting way more painful and the annoying part is he doesn't believe it or think it's a big deal.
hoeaet,So you don‚Äôt have a habit or trend of irresponsible drinking, and you had an injury anyone could have sober that resulted in a broken boneAnd he‚Äôs being this horrid?He‚Äôs got too little empathy to be in a relationship
hoeaet,He used to be more empathetic. That's why his reaction is so weird to me. And nope, no history of irresponsible drinking.
hoeaet,You don‚Äôt need to do anything. He‚Äôs being rude and disrespectful. You‚Äôre hurt and all he is doing is whining and being upset with you.
hoeaet,Exactly. I don't think it happened because I was drinking. It easily could have happened if I hadn't been drinking at all.
hoeaet,Just a couple of fractures for me was two bones broken in three places, and it was repaired by rest and wearing a boot...after having eleven screws and a plate placed in my ankle.  And i did it almost the same way as you, too.  I slipped in a puddle of water after having a few drinks.A fracture is a break.  A break doesnt mean you can see the bone sticking through the skin or something.  Your boyfriend is being so dumb.If your fracture can be repaired without surgery, bravo! But that means you have to be even more careful about taking the time and rest to let it heal, because you dont have permanent hardware holding the fracture in place.Your boyfriend, and everyone one around you, needs to be extra supportive of you during this time.  If they are not, you dont need them and they may be detrimental to your recovery.
hoeaet,Ouch! I can't imagine having eleven screws and a plate. Thag sounds very painful. Hope it is all healed now!My doctor said mine will likely heal fine with just rest and a boot. My boyfriend is definitely not being extra supportive. My foot was super sore tonight and I could hardly walk. Did he try to help me or act concerned? Nope. Just ignored me. I do have great friends and an aunt and uncle close by who would be supportive if I ever needed help with anything.
hoeaet,Why did the update post get locked? You made the right decision breaking up! Good luck moving out :)
hoeaet,I have no idea. I was wondering the same! Thank you!
la7wwg,It takes two people to decide to have a child, one to decide not to. Anything else is a recipe for disaster (believe me, I have a toddler, and even though she was very much wanted and planner for, there were some times when she was an infant I almost wished I could run out (part of that was PPD, but still...) I can't imagine what it would be like mentally if you felt forced into it to start with.That said, I would suggest some serious talks/couple's therapy, since having kids or not is a pretty big line you really can't compromise on (my friend didn't want kids and his wife did. She said that if they had some, she would do all the childcare and he wouldn't have to worry about it. About 1 week into newborn stage, that was found to be not at all what you can do. You need all hands on deck with a baby up every 2hrs). This is something you both need to work out and settle on a hard yes or no on both sides.
la7wwg,Can't upvote this enough, as someone who's had a baby. It is insanely hard work. If my husband had ever said he wouldn't change a diaper, I'd have - well, probably burst into exhausted tears and begged my mom to take me home. You cannot do it unless he is prepared to give everything he's got, and then some. He is being ignorant and immature.
la7wwg,Based on that diaper comment, no way would I have a child with this person. No fucking way.
la7wwg,I wouldn't even continue to date a person who made that comment
la7wwg,Right? My ex and I are no longer together but lord almighty that man probably changed more diapers than I did. He helped make the baby, he can damn well help keep it alive.
la7wwg,This. Upon reading the original post, i was going to say something along the lines of "you'll never truly be ready for a child but it you don't want one right now don't let him pressure you." Then I saw the edit and that's a big hell no.
la7wwg,Agreed. I have a lot of family who would love to help pick up the slack, but I‚Äôm excruciatingly aware of all the responsibilities and negatives that could come with a baby.
la7wwg,Agreed It takes two to tango
la7wwg,This happened to a friend, he went baby crazy, they had a child, he decides it‚Äôs too difficult, leaves. She‚Äôs now alone with a baby she didn‚Äôt want in the first place. Fun times.
la7wwg,What a fucking douchebag
la7wwg,Almost got trapped that why by my ex I suspect. A very similar thing to what OP is going through.When you don't want kids as a woman, you don't choose your partner based on their skills as a potential co-parent... so rather naturally, your partner doesn't have those skills. So when my ex said he wanted kids, it didn't take long to make it clear what he really wanted was for a woman to provide him with kids and a vision of the family he wanted. With another man who truly wanted to parent, I would have absolutely considered it. But with him, I knew I'd basically be a single parent even if we didn't split. He barely even tried to hide that fact from me.
la7wwg,babies are the top of the list of things that are "2 yeses and 1 no" - so the answer is, no babies.this might be a phase? but the answer is level headed communication. if it's not a phase, he'll have to decide if he'd rather be a father or continue to be married to you. these forks in the road are so hard and i'm sorry you're both going through it.
la7wwg,It‚Äôs just especially rough right now. I just lost someone in my immediate family and just got and recovered from covid. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm loosing it.
la7wwg,I highly suggest therapy ASAP. A lot is happening and changing right now, and big, life-changing decisions shouldn't be made on a whim. You both need to talk through these feelings with the support of a professional.
la7wwg,This is a well thought out response, and hopefully I can find some help within my pay grade
la7wwg,Check out r/regretfulparents to see just how bad things get when people have kids they don‚Äôt want.
ipn9d3,Thanks for your kind words. If things do go south with Annie, I know what I want in my next partner.
ipn9d3,Honestly, man. I‚Äôd take it as a sign and leave while you can. I went through the same thing not long ago in a five year relationship where I fought to be with her for the last three years of our relationship and finally one day just decided that I/we couldn‚Äôt make it work and that was that. It stings, it‚Äôs gonna suck because you‚Äôre essentially letting go of everything you guys built together, but you can and will build a relationship and love again. Just be sure to build it with someone that you know you can be comparable with for the long-haul. To me, that just doesn‚Äôt sound like this is what that is.
ipn9d3,thanks for the advice. I think I put in a lot more work into making it work than she did.I want to see if she's willing to make changes on her end in the next little while, if not, yeah I'll have to walk away. It's gonna suck, she was the only girlfriend to really understand mental illness but didn't understand how her actions could be damaging. Ironic...
ipn9d3,That's what my mom said too.I've going to not buy the ring anymore, explain to her how her actions are damaging to us and give her a half a year to see if she's willing to change. If not, I'll have to walk away.EDIT: I even offered to pay for her therapy too! She just refuses....
ipn9d3,Basically-She is extremely hypocritical. Some things that she claims pisses her off, she does them too. (like I didn't feel like doing the dishes one night, she'd call me lazy. She doesn't do the dishes, she would say "I was gonna do them later!"There are some things she refuses to change about herself (she claims that's her personality)The thing about her temperShe has a high standard for her partner but does not set a similar standard for herself.There are some other extremely specific ones to her that I'm not going to list.
ipn9d3,It sounds like you already asked her to change and improve. I think if she wanted to, or was willing to work on it for you, she would have done so by now.
ipn9d3,I don't think I've ever been at quite the level of resentment about things that Annie seems to be, but I have definitely been the person who blows up and refuses to let things go. However, I am aware that I'm doing it and absolutely racked with guilt about it. I have actively worked to try to better control myself in the heat of the moment and to wait to try to communicate with my SO once the anger has passed. I have decided that it's something I want to change about myself and I'm trying. Unfortunately it seems like Annie is either not fully aware of how much she's hurting you and the relationship or she does not care enough to try and change things. If she's genuinely unaware I'm not sure what you could do other than try to talk about it which you clearly have already done, and if she just doesn't care, well...you deserve better.
ipn9d3,What's the best way of asking her to let things go? Like she's still mad about something from 6 months ago. Like as bad as that was- the fallout would have been minimal and the worst case scenario is unlikely.
ipn9d3,You can definitely ask her to try to control her anger and her resentment and go to therapy. You can even list all the problematic things you now see if you want and see what happens. Shes sounds like a very vindictive, stubborn person who holds a grudge which would be incredibly exhausting to deal with.Ultimately, its your decision. You should be with someone who makes you happy, eases your anxieties and stresses, and works to make the relationship work if youre having a rough patch.  Not someone who villainizes you and cant see her own faults. Thats a lack of self awareness and maturity that can turn toxic quickly, and it sounds like it already has. If youre not happy and havent been for a while, this is not the person for you.
ipn9d3,Thanks for the advice. Yup, mom said the same thing. Do you really want to be married to someone who's going to be on your ass every time you make a mistake?I've also mentioned this to my friend and he was like I had the same problem, I would jump through hoops to make her happy but that was never good enough. I wish I didn't waste those 2 years on someone who doesn't appreciate my efforts.
ipn9d3,Don't marry red flags.
ipn9d3,This is a really tough spot to be in... I think it would be best if you spent some time on your own to gain some clarity about this situation...On one hand your initial feelings of doubt and fear towards your girlfriend are something you should listen to... Possibly even consider getting therapy to deal with this inner conflict like you suggested to your girlfriend. Also considering you mentioned having a "mental-breakdown" please try talking to someone, it can really help.On the other hand, your girlfriend's behavior (of chronically being upset and angry about small petty things) seems to bother you a lot. You should listen to how that makes you feel, and (although its normal to get mad sometimes) you don't deserve to be constantly on trial and walking on egg shells.On another hand, your mother gave you her input on your relationship, and although she is a psychologist she is also your mother and her opinion will have an impact on your opinion of your girlfriend. She probably shouldn't have told you all those negative things, but she did, and now you have to address them as best you can.I have a friend right now in a very similar position. COVID has forced many people to quarantine with their family, their friends or their partners for far to long. Its sort of like "death-by-exposure" where your relationship is in a microwave. High energy, high temperatures. Things are bound to explode. I'm not saying this to persuade you to stay, and there's no way of knowing the future... But I would just ask yourself, what is the biggest issue here? Is it constantly being around her? If so, maybe set aside more alone time... Is it her comments? Have an honest discussion with her, where you ask her to keep her personal criticisms to a minimum... Is it her energy? Let her know how she's coming across and figure out whether her energy is actually negative or if this perspective is caused by your anxious thoughts... What exactly is the issue that's nagging internally at you? Once you get to the bottom of that, you might find your answer and figure out how the best way to forward for yourself is. Good luck!!!
ipn9d3,Thanks for your kind words!Already in therapy to handle my condition. It's been helping for the most part but the mass accumulation of stress kind of pushed me over the edge.I probably never noticed the red flags until we were pretty much bonded together 24/7.
ipn9d3,haha, my mom has hated most of the girls I dated but she has never interfered with our relationships.Honestly hearing this from my mom, my friends and random strangers on reddit is showing me that this probably isn't right. I want to give her a chance but the next blow up, I'm done.
ipn9d3,Look if you don‚Äôt like how she acts, that‚Äôs who she is, and most likely should would have to go through something major to really change. Your relationship is yours, and you know how you really feel. If you haven‚Äôt talked to your gf about this then that‚Äôs where you should start. Give her a chance to change, but don‚Äôt keep waiting around. Sometimes relationships just need to end if they aren‚Äôt compatible anymore. And not to be rude, but don‚Äôt compare your relationship to other people‚Äôs. Relationships have similar aspects but they aren‚Äôt the same. Look at your relationship, don‚Äôt be worried about what happened in other relationships. Take it as a guide of what not to do, but don‚Äôt look at your relationship as doomed because someone else‚Äôs didnt work out. Your mom has dropped 2.5 years of information on you so it‚Äôs a lot to take in. The way that I like to think of it is if you were to just meet this person, would you still fall in love with them if you knew how the act? Would you still have respect for them? Would you think it is a healthy relationship? Sometimes people hold onto relationships because they think of the person in the honeymoon phase. When you first start dating and nothing can go wrong. Knowing everything your mom and you have noticed, would you still get in a relationship with her?
ipn9d3,My friend said the same thing. He said what happened to me isn't necessarily going to happen to you, I'm just telling you what happened to me so you don't make the same mistakes.I have talked to her and every time I see if she's willing to make a change, she would say that's the way I am. If that's not what you want, door's that way.I think you're spot on with that honeymoon phase comment. She was so nice and warm during those times. But due to everything that's happened, she's not the person she used to be. If she was like this at the start, I would have walked out the door after the first month.
ipn9d3,UPDATE:Annie came back from shopping a little while ago and we've been talking. Apparently she wasn't shopping she was out to meet my mom and they chatted for an hour about what happened while I was home.Now, Annie didn't really apologize but said that she wasn't aware that her actions were causing me a lot of stress. She promised that she'll let things go and we'll move forward after a one and done argument.I think that's a step forward but I still think she should go to therapy and address the other issues. But one step at a time.
ipn9d3,I give her two weeks max to go right back to how she was.Personality changes/improvements like this are incredibly hard and take intense strength, extrinsic changes, and motivational factors. You keep taking her back, and she won‚Äôt seek help, so what‚Äôs to say she‚Äôll actually change?
mjp05x,You are worried about him getting half of everything. Half of everything today is less than half of everything in 10 years. Kick him out and divorce him. His wealthy mother will not see him homeless. Just do it!!!
mjp05x,Not to mention she‚Äôs paying way MORE than half now. Half would be a 25 to 40% savings.Kick this leech to the curb, OP.
mjp05x,Completely agree with the divorce. However, you need to speak to your divorce attorney before doing this:Kick him outOtherwise you could end up in really hot water depending on your jurisdiction. Judges in general don't look kindly on one spouse unilaterally kicking out another spouse from the martial home.
mjp05x,Divorcing him now will be cheaper than sustaining him later.He‚Äôs a leech, not a partner. You can‚Äôt fix that, and you should not let him sugarcoat it.It seems he never learned about financial responsibility and isn‚Äôt interested in doing the work of building a future with you unless it‚Äôs easy for him. It isn‚Äôt your job to teach him or keep him afloat. Surely you‚Äôre doing a huge favor for the mom who ditched him and his brother. You‚Äôve made so many mistakes already. Get some self respect and divide accounts ASAP. Also, keep your apartment for now. Do not have a child with this guy. You deserve so much better.
mjp05x,Absolutely. Op, talk to a lawyer. What ever amount he gets of yours in a divorce, in a way, he already has it now. If you divorce him all your future income is yours alone. Cut your losses, your income will also feel like more if you don‚Äôt have a deadweight pulling you down:He doesn‚Äôt respect you and he obviously his happy using you as financial support instead of his mother:It absolutely sucks that he had dug his claws into so much of your money and assets.And I know this is your dream home, but even a beautiful house will start feeling like a prison if you are trapped in it with the wrong person.
mjp05x,My brother is literally divorcing his wife after a 2.5 year marriage because of this exact same kind of situation. She is sweet, but hides behind the "I'm struggling" victimhood mentality. I get that depression is a thing, but at least do SOMETHING! Fuck. The amount of money that my brother has spent on her over the last 8 years - on therapists, online courses, holidays, and everything in-between, is astronomical. My brother has literally been taking care of a fucking child since they got married, and slightly before then.She was spoilt and grew up as an only child, and honestly, I think she saw an "easy life" with my brother.The ridiculous thing to me is that for the last 3 years, she didn't even cook, or clean the house. She just slept late, watched TV, and played video games all day, while my brother was working fucking hard. He would get home, and nothing would be organized, no food ready, dirty house.... fuuuckit I had a soft spot in my heart for her, but when I heard that my brother had been living for at least 3 years like this, I told him straight up, YES. Divorce her. It won't get better, especially after many years of promises. Thank god they didn't have children.Sorry I had to rant. I wish her well, but I am SO happy that my bro is divorcing her. He deserves much better than that leech.p.s if OP reads this, since you basically paid off most of the mortgage payments each month since you got the place, there may be a possibility that you have a stronger claim to the house. Maybe you'll be given the opportunity to "buy-out" his portion. Ask your lawyer. I'd say that if you are truly unhappy and don't see him changing, get out before it's too late. You're 34, with a good career -  you'll be able to find someone better, who you actually deserve.
mjp05x,You paid off his loan?!?! OP, no!!You deserve so much better. Your first relationship was abusive, so is this one. Just in a different way. Please, divorce him. Speak to a lawyer before he‚Äôs somehow entitled to even more of you money.
mjp05x,I thought the same thing. OP keeps making terrible relationship mistakes.
mjp05x,Probably a month, and then he'd bury us in debt or have his mom bail us out.  But, I would never let us hit rock bottom like that because his rock bottom is also my rock bottom since my name is on everything too (and I have never missed paying a bill in my life). Every man I know has hustle behind them - they want to take care of things. He doesn't seem to have that in him. I hoped therapy would help find a little oomph and drive, but he refuses to go.
mjp05x,It's clear that niceness isn't a problem in this marriage, instead it's debt, lying and entitlement.It would be worth contemplating for you why "nice to me" was your only qualification instead of a necessary one along with responsible and a true partner. You're accepting way less than you're worth, why? What's going on with you that you were willing to overlook any financial issues from him and with yourself to the bone rather than demand a partnership?
mjp05x,Again, he lied about his true financial situation until it was uncovered at a later date.  I have been gently demanding fairness but it doesn't seem to get through.  After years in a prior abusive marriage, I felt emotionally and physically safe with him - past trauma has made a people pleaser of me... I thought I had stated that but perhaps not.
mjp05x,Stop dating people for their potential. Date them if they‚Äôre already a good person.
mjp05x,I had to stop reading when you mention that after the debt and the lying about it that you actually were trying to bring a child into the world with this person. A person who would lie about his finances to you, hose you out of tens of thousands of dollars, not pitch in really at all, and you think, ‚Äúyeah let‚Äôs add a baby to this.‚ÄùOP, I understand the trauma of an abusive relationship and wanting to please people (lived through it myself) but there is a difference between wanting to please and actually being a doormat. If you‚Äôre not in therapy already please look into it.As for divorce, I‚Äôm not really sure how one would get out of this without losing even more, but let this be a painful and expensive lesson: next time you want to get into a serious relationship with someone, you need to ask to see their finances in writing, on paper. Bank statements, taxes, etc. It‚Äôs completely fair, especially if you‚Äôre volunteering paying for the bulk of everything and even more so if you‚Äôre considering marriage.
mjp05x,A person who would lie about his finances to you, hose you out of tens of thousands of dollars, not pitch in really at all, and you think, ‚Äúyeah let‚Äôs add a baby to this.‚ÄùThen in five years, we get the "I work, I do all the housework, I do all the childcare with help from childminders, how do I make him help" post....
mjp05x,Why do you feel stuck? You can leave him. He‚Äôs obviously taking severe advantage of you.
lqpshq,Don't mention this to your wife, this is your mid life crisis problem to deal with. You are fearing ageing and fearing growing older with things 'undone'. This isn't about that girl 16 years ago, it's about you worrying about all the things you haven't done with your life.Therapy for you, or lean to deal with the fact that you are going to get older and there will always be 'other things' that you can't be a part of.
lqpshq,Yeah... definitely don‚Äôt mention that to the wife
lqpshq,A lot of the time it‚Äôs easy to romanticize something that happened forever ago because you forget about the bad parts and all the reasons that person wasn‚Äôt meant for us. Just remember that it ended for a reason and you love your wife.
lqpshq,Don‚Äôt mention it to your wife, odds are in another month this girl will have completely left your mind but your wife still might be anxious if you tell her.This means literally nothing besides that you‚Äôre temporarily stuck going ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù  It‚Äôs not about this girl at all, she would be a total stranger to you now and was pretty much a total stranger to you while you were dating her for barely enough time for a mouse to gestate a litter.  It‚Äôs not even about the lack of closure‚Äîwhat closure do you need from something that barely began?You just are in a rut we sometimes get into where your life is good but you wonder if it could have been better. Concentrate on what you have, and if you have areas of dissatisfaction, think of ways to improve those in future.  With the weather warming up, see if you can get out of the house and do something new with your wife (stay COVID safe though).  And don‚Äôt give these thoughts more weight than they actually have.
lqpshq,she would be a total stranger to you nowComplete and total stranger. I dont recall ever seeing her on social media over the years when I used it. I literally have nothing more than a small inkling of what she is doing as a career currently, and nothing moreYou just are in a rut we sometimes get into where your life is good but you wonder if it could have been better. Concentrate on what you have, and if you have areas of dissatisfaction, think of ways to improve those in future. With the weather warming up, see if you can get out of the house and do something new with your wife (stay COVID safe though). And don‚Äôt give these thoughts more weight than they actually have.I had just mention this to my wife yesterday that she and I need to get out just us and do something
lqpshq,I think it‚Äôs natural to get nostalgic about our younger years with fresher bodies and fewer worries... so yeah as someone who is also in his mid 30s I don‚Äôt love the amount I have to think about retirement planning now as compared to how little I worried about my job back then. I remember taking multiple days off from work for a bender when i turned 21. I can‚Äôt even fathom what that would feel like now!At some point it‚Äôs worth talking to your wife about how you feel about approaching middle age, and how every step further from youth makes you feel. She probably wants to share the same with you. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs great to specifically share ‚Äúi keep thinking about the great sex i had with this one girlfriend. I wish we had done it more!‚Äù There‚Äôs probably a better way to talk about what you‚Äôre nostalgic about from that time in your life, just in more generic terms with respect to your sex life back then
lqpshq,I think this is it right here. I had just become an active in the fraternity I pledged. I was in the best shape of my life. I always felt like I had trouble with girls, so this organic relationship came along out of the blue, and I am just romanticizing about that short time period. She just happens to be part of that.Maybe I need to work on getting myself back into that shape, because that is something I can do, and can relive.
lqpshq,I really don't think it's about closure, which is a nebulous concept at best. Sometimes, brains just latch onto things to worry at for a bit. The story you have about this relationship might have some symbolic value for you right now, too. Are you, as u/Normalityisrestored suggested, feeling some FOMO? Are you feeling some loss of control and fixating on a different situation where you felt like you didn't have control? Is there a part of yourself that was more front-and-center in that relationship or in that time of your life that you now miss?
lqpshq,You should speak to a therapist about this, not your wife. It's really bizarre to be this hung up on the relationship still, it's not healthy to fixate on basically a stranger like this.You barely knew this girl. Telling your wife will do nothing but cause her pain.
lqpshq,It's really bizarre to be this hung up on the relationship still, it's not healthy to fixate on basically a stranger like this.I've been hung up on it for about 2 days. I had the dream 2 nights ago and this has all been driving me insane since.
lqpshq,I think it‚Äôs east to feel this way because you are probably nostalgic for that time of life and because you had no closure. Maybe write a letter and then go somewhere and burn it?
lqpshq,i think there's a slight shift in thinking that could really change your perspective on this. it's just a dream. a dream of a wonderful time that... in a vacuum... you'd like to go back to for a short stay now & again. who wouldn't? a great short young love affair is a wonderful experience to have that produces memories that can be enjoyed for a lifetime.but all it is, is a dream. an intense one. one that has crept into waking life. but still, it is not just a dream... but a memory & a fantasy. it is not something real. remember that. it is not something real. if you don't agonize over it, but simply accept it, eventually it will go away. agonizing & worrying is the real threat here.so hell... why not just enjoy the fantasy? this dream has brought back intense feelings. why not ride them out & jerk off like a maniac to this fantasy for a week or two or whatever. why not burn the fantasy out, bonfire style, masturbating like a 13 year old... instead of the slow agonizing burn of anxiety of guilt?maybe there's a choice here. think about it. good luck!!
lqpshq,so hell... why not just enjoy the fantasy? this dream has brought back intense feelings. why not ride them out & jerk off like a maniac to this fantasy for a week or two or whatever. why not burn the fantasy out, bonfire style, masturbating like a 13 year old... instead of the slow agonizing burn of anxiety of guilt?I dont even remember the sex, that is the weirdest thing about all of this. There are other girls I slept with and/or dated that I remember everything much more vividly.
isigqa,When something smells fishy is because it's rotten.This whole "misunderstanding"  is too far fetched to actually sound believable and I really hate it when people take me for a fool and insult my intelligence. It hurts more than the actual cheating.Your boyfriend has crossed too many red lines, gave false promises,then stomped on those red lines all over and then fabricated a ridiculous fairytale. Not a reliable guy. Even if he didn't physically cheat, all of the above would be enough for me to cross him out as a suitable partner.
isigqa,When something smells fishy is because it's rotten.Yes. She's not just into him. He's into her. You two just fought about her and when you two get into another argument, he decides to stay at HER place? He doesn't care enough about your feelings OP.
isigqa,Jumping in here as it's the top.So, he told her that YOU had a problem with their texting? That's inappropriate. If he really understands your feelings the correct thing to do would be to say HE felt it was inappropriate as he is in a relationship and she is overstepping.What he should have done;"Mary, I am your friend and I am always here if you need a hand with anything but it is inappropriate for me to be in constant contact with you. I have my own relationship and obligations to look after and being available to you this intensely for this long has lead to me neglecting them. Please respect that I need to devote time to my own life and loves but I am available if you need my help."What he actually did;" Yeah my girlfriend isn't happy. She doesn't want us talking anymore as she thinks it's inappropriate. She doesn't understand, it's not your fault. I tried telling her but she wouldn't listen so I think for now we should cool it a bit."He is clearly into her. She is clearly into him. He is keeping her dangling by a thread just enough that she will hang around and he gets to feel desired.Your boyfriend is a loser.* Please rethink what you're getting from him and if he's worth it.*My comment was banned for using a harsher term than loser so reposted with a G rating.
isigqa,Yea this is really weird. If they were friends and texted everyday, I doubt they went from that to never texting at all. He probably changed her name in his phone tbh
isigqa,Even if he didn‚Äôt physically cheat with her, he crossed a boundary and lied about it. A boundary you were very clear about and claimed to understand. You should call it quits.
isigqa,Even in the event he is telling the truth and "nothing happened" - he purposely went over and stayed at the house of a woman who is damaging your relationship without any regard for you. It doesn't really seem like he cares about your feelings.That was exactly what I said, but he claims he didn't really think about it and that it's not a big deal because she wasn't staying there too.
isigqa,DUDE.Wake up.They're fucking.
isigqa,And the mutual friends are covering for him
isigqa,I was wondering this, too.  I once dated a dude who would instigate big fights and leave dramatically - found out he was doing it on purpose so he could go spend time with the person he was cheating on me with because he knew I‚Äôd ‚Äúgive him space‚Äù after a fight and not ask too many questions.
isigqa,"he ended up telling her that I'm uncomfortable with them texting all the time "Why would he do that? Tell her that it is you that is uncomfortable with them talking all the time? Instead of, you know, just cutting back on replying, or telling her he has to focus on his relationship. It's like "I would like to talk to you but my mean girlfriend is saying I can't". That's an exaggeration, but I think you shouldn't tell people that your partner is preventing you from interacting with them because that almost always sounds like the partner is controlling or forcing you to do something.Also, they agreed to stop talking altogether, and then she called to "check on him"... Plus he doesn't tell you he slept at her place, hell the sheer fact that he did when he knows this woman makes you uncomfortable... He seems to have his priorities all wrong.
isigqa,Agreed on this point 100%
isigqa,I wonder about OP not asking where he stayed when they had a big fight, too.  If you‚Äôre with someone that long, you generally know their friends and habits...something tells me she didn‚Äôt want to ask because her gut already knew the answer.
isigqa,Yep. I noticed that too. He basically communicated to her that "If it weren't for my girlfriend being upset, I would still want to keep this level of engagement."This guy is crap.
isigqa,The second you said he told her you were uncomfortable...that‚Äôs the first sign that this is just gross and not okay.A quality person owns it. They don‚Äôt throw you under the bus with ‚Äúmy girrrrrrrrlfriend doesn‚Äôt liiiiiiike it‚Äù because all that does is place them both on a team against you where they understand that you don‚Äôt understand. Stupid.He chooses to stay at hers. Who knows when she went out of town.It‚Äôs done. Call it. He‚Äôs bad at loyalty. You don‚Äôt have to outright cheat for that to be so. Right now you‚Äôre just hanging around waiting for him to hurt you ‚Äúbig enough‚Äù that you justify leaving. That alone is enough to justify leaving.
isigqa,Almost guaranteed he was cheating. Idk how else to see this. At the very least he was thinking about her in that way and just waited for an excuse. Sorry OP.
isigqa,Ya she just happen to call him on the night they had a fight when they supposedly have no communications? I bet the call and text logs says otherwise.
ja7ie5,In case anyone else hasn‚Äôt mentioned it, look up ‚Äúenmeshed‚Äù and ‚Äúemotional husband‚Äù.He‚Äôs deep in the FOG and is putting his mom before you. Don‚Äôt see him continuing to date you as you winning or him choosing you. He‚Äôs putting her emotional well-being before yours. She‚Äôs putting hers before his, and she always will. Because punishing him keeps him in line. That‚Äôs a difficult dynamic to break.
ja7ie5,Honestly, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs an otherwise good guy...but you don‚Äôt want a mamas boy who will choose his mother‚Äôs narc/borderline temper tantrums over you because it‚Äôs momentarily convenientDon‚Äôt dump him because his mother wants it. Take a break and hope he grows up and grows a pair really soon. JMO.
ja7ie5,I can already see the scenario. OP and her boyfriend make plans and suddenly some sort of ailment befalls the mom preventing the couple from doing anything because "my mom needs me".
ja7ie5,Yeah why is he asking his mom for permission to visit his girlfriend?Why is he asking her permission for anything?!
ja7ie5,I see a future full of r/justnomil here. The bf‚Äôs mother is always going to be right there in their relationship with a bunch of guilt about how he‚Äôs the only thing that makes her life worthwhile. OP needs to think about the fact that MIL is going to be a permanent fixture/issue/problem.
ja7ie5,IMO, bf mom is never going to like anyone he gets involved with. He may never be able to have any kind of relationship until mom is dead and buried.
ja7ie5,Yeah üíØ. You don‚Äôt want to date a guy who is willing to stop seeing you because his mom asked him to and he doesn‚Äôt want to make her sad.
ja7ie5,OP - what are you even getting out of this relationship? If you don't ever get to see him, what's the point?I know LDRs happen, and sometimes they work out, but at your age I honestly see zero point to dealing with this situation. You should be dating and figuring out what you want/need/like/etc in a partner.
ja7ie5,Oh god their wedding would end by her going nuclear
ja7ie5,Your boyfriend's mother does not like you, and at this point it's likely she never will. She had told your boyfriend not to see you and he took her side. Her happiness is more important than yours. Just think on that.I wouldn't consider seeing each other once every 6 months a relationship. I say break up and revisit when you can actually see each other.
ja7ie5,I don't think this guy is in a position to maintain a healthy romantic relationship. I wouldn't waste your time on him.
ja7ie5,He‚Äôs 20, and she doesn‚Äôt want him to be in a serious relationship?uhhhhhh I guess she means, she doesn‚Äôt want him to be in a serious relationship with someone who isn‚Äôt herself.I could understand if you both lived under her roof and had plans to make a million babies with no jobs, education, unstable future... but she honestly sound more like a JustNOMIL!
ja7ie5,This. This was the biggest red flag for me. How is 20 ‚Äútoo young‚Äù for a serious relationship??
ja7ie5,my boyfriend has said that her happiness depends on him so he's pretty conflicted as well.Your boyfriend is in a toxic, codependent relationship with his mother. It's unlikely to get better, since it sounds normalized to the point he doesn't even recognize it as toxic and codependent and is actively enabling and reinforcing it.His mom wants y'all to break up because she has a toxic, codependent relationship with her son. It's unlikely to get better, because you're a threat to her toxic, codependent relationship with her son, not because you aren't good enough for him.Your boyfriend's mom is explicitly trying to manipulate and engineer a breakup, and your boyfriend won't do anything to put a stop to it. This will keep happening for the rest of your relationship, whether it's one week or 10 years. Your boyfriend has shown he prioritizes his mother's happiness over your relationship. He's "conflicted" because he doesn't know how to handle the situation such that his mother gets her way (y'all break up) and he doesn't end up miserable. He will choose being miserable over standing up to his mother, and should he somehow manage to keep the relationship going through months of quarantine, then you'll both just be miserable so that his mother keeps her leash on her little baby boy.Think about all the moving on you could do between now and the end of the pandemic instead of spending all that time waiting to (possibly) resume dating a boy and his toxic mother.
ja7ie5,OP please read this comment!! I couldn‚Äôt have said it any better.
ja7ie5,Sounds like your boyfriend already picked her when she demanded he pick one of you.Maybe best to ditch the mama's boy, this will only get worse.
ja7ie5,he asked his mom about visiting me in AugustA 20 year old man. Asked his Mum for permission.You sound like you are embracing your independence and adulthood. You are supporting yourself, experiencing life and  developing as a person. You are growing. Is he?My advice is to break up with him. Not for her but for you. There is so much more waiting to happen in your life and he isnt ready to join you in any of it yet. Dont let him hold you back.
isl4a2,He misses connecting with you in conversations where you are excited or passionate.  Start reading a book together out loud, learn a language together, or get a new joint hobby.
isl4a2,It sounds like he found it attractive and exciting that you had intellectual and creative interests. You putting those aside and saying you don‚Äôt have the attention span for them may have caused him to feel not just your hobbies but your personality has changed.I saw you comment that rejections for your writing have made you give up. I‚Äôm a writer myself, and I definitely feel that! I only just got an agent, after more years I care to say (20) of looking for one off and on for a couple of novels. I gave up for several years until I got a new hobby (fan fiction!) that resparked my desire to write another book.Did you confide in your husband about your frustrations? My husband has given me a lot of support and reassurance over the years about my writing.If you truly want to give up reading and writing as hobbies, that‚Äôs fine. But I think that you haven‚Äôt replaced them with anything mentally stimulating or creative has affected how your husband regards you.
isl4a2,I'll ask him if there are any hobbies he'd like to pursue with me. He hasn't mentioned anything specific, his hobbies are all games and tech and stuff
isl4a2,Start going on dates again( try to be creative..cuz pandemic n all) Every relationship needs effort to keep going. It's ok that's your interests are changing but have you developed new interests? If yes, talk about it with him.
isl4a2,I guess I haven't really developed new interests. Social media and reality TV and stuff but that's not super interesting to him and that's fine. I'll talk to him and ask about new date ideas. Dinner and movie have gotten kind of old.
isl4a2,Do you...have any hobbies or goals? Perhaps he's concerned that you spend your free time watching Netflix and surfing social media and that's not the healthiest use of your time?My husband and I have mostly different hobbies, but, as your husband is hinting towards, we talk to each other about the other one's hobbies and ask questions to show interest, even if it's not a hobby we'd be particularly interested in partaking ourselves.
isl4a2,Honestly, not really. I like the TV I watch and I like talking to friends. I have goals to do well at work and have a family. But I'm not nearly as ambitious as I used to be. I don't want to write the great American novel anymore haha. My husband has a lot of things he does but tbh he does spend most time playing games with friends.
isl4a2,I don't know what to tell him then. I've replaced that passion and excitement with pleasure and contentment. Maybe that'll change in the future but right now that's where I am.
isl4a2,Reading through this I wonder if a fundamental incompatibility is starting to form. For me at least I want a partner who is as curious and constantly self-improving as I am. It could be that was a huge reason he was attracted to you.If that changes, a lot of the attraction could be lost (assuming his concern isn‚Äôt something else like your happiness ‚Äî you should dig into this with him.)You say you don‚Äôt see your role as someone to inspire him, but if that‚Äôs what he looks for in a partner, that‚Äôs the incompatibility.As we get older, we often get comfortable and no longer feel the need to woo or impress. Are you both putting in effort to keep the marriage fresh and to be impressive and attractive to each other?
isl4a2,This is a good point. Maybe that's what's going on. I personally don't look to my partner to be impressive or anything and don't really like being put in that role. But maybe that's what he wants from me.
isl4a2,I went through a similar time around your age.  I finally had the job and the house and all that stuff, so I just settled in.  My husband had hobby after hobby, and I just did whatever he was doing or spent time relaxing.  I was perfectly fine, but I was not  interesting, and more than that, I was relying on my husband to make my life interesting.  We went where he wanted and saw what he was interested in, I was just along for the ride.I doubt your husband is bored of you, he just wants you to be excited about something.  Something personal to you, something you do just because it makes you happy.  You won't find this by asking what he wants to do.  I encourage you to start thinking selfishly.  Forget his plans and interests, say "I want to go apple picking" or "I think it'd be cool to learn to dance" or "I'd like to try knitting".  Whatever it is, try it and own it.
isl4a2,I get what you're saying, but what if you're not curious about any of those things? I don't really have an interest in dancing or knitting or apple picking so it's hard to imagine picking something up like that out of the blue with no inherent curiosity or interest.
isl4a2,Could it be that he's meaning to be motivational but going about it the wrong way? I get why you might take these comments to heart but his intentions could be well-intentioned.
isl4a2,I agree that he's well meaning. I just don't know what to really do with these comments. I'm not at all unhappy with how I live my life.
isl4a2,So I used to be SUPER ambitious too in my early 20s. Now I‚Äôm 30, just had a kid, and I‚Äôve toned it down a lot. I‚Äôm way more chill and lazy now.That said, I think there‚Äôs a huge difference between me and you. Yes, everyday I mainly work, play with baby, watch TV. But long term, across many days and months, I still have dreams, I still have goals.Being less ambitious doesn‚Äôt mean you stop having ANY goals! It just means the timeline for them, or the end post, has shifted.I used to do a lot of art. Now I don‚Äôt do any, but my passion for being creative has stayed. It just MANIFESTS differently now, by encouraging art in my baby, ‚Äúplaying piano‚Äù with him, and trying new house DIY projects.Similarly, I‚Äôm not as ambitious in work anymore, but I‚Äôm not like ‚Äúok whatever as long as I have a job‚Äù. I still strive for promotions, I still want to be a VP, it‚Äôs just I‚Äôve become OK with a longer timeline and path to get there. It‚Äôs not worth late nights if I sacrifice time with family. I‚Äôll take the longer road there now.It sounds like you dropped completely who you were. And no offense, turned into this like mindless shell.I don‚Äôt think your husband is wrong for feeling this. It‚Äôs not your problem to fix, if you don‚Äôt want to, but personally I couldn‚Äôt stay with someone like you. Relationships are for the long haul, and if you‚Äôve already lost interest in life at 29, I can‚Äôt imagine it would get any easier when you‚Äôre both 60. You‚Äôll have nothing to contribute to the conversation by then except for the newest tv show news. Harsh, sorry, but ...something to think about.
mycpq7,You say she‚Äôs in therapy, and it seems to be helping, but this is pretty extreme. She might need to see a psychiatrist, and not just a therapist.
mycpq7,These are all symptoms of someone who has been emotionally abused. She should work with BOTH a psychiatrist for appropriate meds and a really good therapist that specializes in her particular healing.
mycpq7,I came to say this. As a bi polar person who‚Äôs been on the right meds for two years. Sometimes therapy isn‚Äôt enough.
mycpq7,That‚Äôs so difficult, I‚Äôm sorry about the entire situation. Your girlfriend sounds like she needs trauma therapy, not just a therapist.I help folks with childhood trauma, many of whom had religious indoctrination trauma and narcissist parents. Hit me up if you ever need anything.
mycpq7,I didn't know there was a difference between a psychiatrist and a therapistEdit: thank you everyone, now I know the difference. I really appreciate the info
mycpq7,A good psychiatrist can be life changing.
mycpq7,There's some solid advice here:seeking out a psychiatrist and exploring medication for herfinding a therapist for you to help you process all this and build stronger boundariesrecognizing that enabling her behavior isn't actually helpful to her in the long-termTo add to this, you mentioned she really wants children. Have you considered what growing up with a mother like this would do to their mental health? I can very much empathize with her desire to be a parent, but it doesn't sound like she is in a place mentally and emotionally do do this.She would cause psychological harm to her children if this behavior persists.
mycpq7,Not only harm to the kid... the wife‚Äôs mental health would take a nosedive. Many people that were less unwell than OP‚Äôs wide have been affected with PPD... I can only imagine how much worse her problems would be.
mycpq7,This is what I came here to say. This woman should NOT be having children. Can you imagine? ‚ÄúTimmy, that‚Äôs a nice cow you‚Äôve drawn.‚Äù ‚ÄúSilly mommy, that‚Äôs a horse not a cow!‚Äù ‚ÄúOmg in the worst mother eveeeeer‚Äù and she breaks down and a three year old has to console her.Poor kids.
mycpq7,I worry when people like this say they want kids. Does she actually want to be a parent or is she seeking an emotional support animal in the form of a living child to fill that massive hole inside of her.
mycpq7,Good point. Further reading on this: ‚ÄúUnderstanding the Borderline Mother‚Äù by Christine Lawson.
mycpq7,She really needs to speak to a psychiatrist. Medication can be something for in a short span of possible while building a proper foundation for her to change her POV until she can confidently speak for herself and not feel like having to walk on eggshells.I almost reached that point in my relationship and I went to therapy and was diagnosed with multiple things that really shocked me and my bf but once i started my medication and proper therapy our relationship skyrocketed.I was the same before. Ex: I was at target and he asked me for his deodorant but they didn't have any so i was looking to see if walmart had it, Ralph's, cvs, Walgreens and I didnt tell him they didn't have his. I went all the way out and he said "I appreciate you went out of your way to get me this, but I didnt want you to spend all this time looking so hard for it. I feel loved but also like I caused you stress for a deodorant. If it wasn't there it was ok. We could've had a mini date looking for the thing or just been ok with another one." I was so red and embarrassed. But now that I'm on medication I text him is not there and if he doesn't respond I'll just let it be and we can get it later or call him if i know he really wants it to see what else i could get him.Therapy has really helped me. My psychiatrist has really helped me. My medication push started me. I am slowly getting to the point where I don't need my medication for anxiety because I am targeting that with my therapist.She needs her therapist to convince her medication is good for HER and SHE needs to want it. It's depressing having to pop pills in your mouth everyday to be "normal" or to not "feel like a burden" but it's just a jump start and it really helps. Speak to her therapist if you can and tell her you want your girlfriend to see if there's any medication to help since it affects daily activities and to convince her they're good for her. Try them out for now and down the line see other options if it isn't working out.
mycpq7,Unfortunately a lot of "therapists" tell the patients: "My goal is to get you off (or keep you off) medication." They are sadly ignorant about what medication can do and about psychiatric diagnosis. Even many psychiatrists don't really know because the pharma industry is so powerful people just forget their psychopharmacology and go for whatever is paying for their lunch. And loads of therapists buy into the patients'/clients' delusions and believe whatever they are hearing. Have seen this many, many times. Actually once had someone (doctoral level but not a psychiatrist) ask me if it were possible that one patient had nanobots inserted into his brain. (Source: Am a psychiatrist)
mycpq7,I agree. There sounds like a lot going on with her that all the therapeutic bootstrapping in the world isn‚Äôt going to make a dent in without some meds to at least even her out. She may not want to go on medication (which I get as I was the same way), but she really will feel differently once she gets something that helps.
mycpq7,This reminds me of a friend who was in therapy for years but still very anxious. I wondered if her therapist might be not that great, but didn‚Äôt say anything. She ended up trying several other therapists as well as yoga and relaxation techniques and there has been noticeable improvement. If you want to stick around, it may be worth pushing for the ‚Äòtherapist switch‚Äô idea.
mnltmh,Maybe you could have a talk with him about how she‚Äôs acting and tell him that you don‚Äôt want to break up their friendship, but that you would feel really loved if he would make it extra clear that he prefers you. Maybe also explain that you don‚Äôt like to be alone with her because she seems to want you to feel weird, and ask for his help with that. However, I recommend that you don‚Äôt dictate exactly how he acts, but rather bring it up and then sit back for a few weeks and see how he handles it. Give him time to observe the situation with new eyes. I think treating him with trust will be better for your relationship, since he hasn‚Äôt done anything to make you question his loyalty.
mnltmh,This is good advice; I hope OP sees this.Express your feelings, ask for help, give him the opportunity to set boundaries with his friend (which he‚Äôs done with your past concern so he seems to care about how you feel).He is your partner, it‚Äôs good to be honest and vulnerable.
mnltmh,I specifically want to address this absolute turd tier, worthless advice I keep seeing in the comments: ‚ÄúIf she‚Äôs at a social event, just don‚Äôt go!!!‚ÄùNo. Wtf is that. You shouldn‚Äôt be forced into feeling so uncomfortable to the point where your contact with your boyfriend and his normal behaving friends is limited because she‚Äôs an a-hole.Everyone who honestly puts their whole heart into a relationship deserves, at the minimum, to go out in public with their s/o and not feel lowly and bad about themselves over it!!Seriously, people in the comments saying this: get your self esteem up!OP, you have got to tell him everything she‚Äôs done. As awkward as it feels saying it you need to just spit it out. You‚Äôre going to come off as the bad guy if you keep pushing the boundaries without the explanation. The stress this has to be causing when you see this b, and the weight it must have on your chest - you‚Äôre going to feel so relieved to just say it, at least.
mnltmh,My boyfriend has a female friend he‚Äôs known way longer than he‚Äôs known me, and he also says he considers her a sister. The big difference though is that she doesn‚Äôt call him pet names, bring up how much more she knows about him, and doesn‚Äôt try to undermine our relationship!Boys can be clueless sometimes and it seems like you need to trust your gut here. Don‚Äôt look at it is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not allowing you to talk to her‚Äù, just tell him your feelings and how you don‚Äôt think she respect your relationship, and let him decide how to proceed. If he changes nothing and lets her keep doing stuff like that, then that‚Äôs very telling
mnltmh,He might just be clueless. I‚Äôd bring it up to him, especially her smug response. Don‚Äôt ask him to cut her off because he‚Äôll get defensive, but ask him to draw some boundaries with her.
mnltmh,Howe long have they know each other, and have you had a chance to see how she interacts with other people other than him?
mnltmh,and have you had a chance to see how she interacts with other people other than him?Yeah I have. We went on a double date once and it seemed like she was paying more attention to my boyfriend than she was to her own date.Howe long have they know each otherThey've known each other for about 4 years.
mnltmh,I get how this is irritating. But clearly he isn't into her. He's know her for years. He hadn't asked her out. He says she is like a sister to him. He choose to date you instead.And you trust him, right? Tell him you think she likes him. But then don't interfer in their friendship. She isn't a threat. And being controlling just tells your BF that you don't trust him.
mnltmh,This is really petty advice, don't do it if you're a good person.  If she is into him then it's probably really bothering her to see him with another girl so play it up.  Have your hands on him, sit really close to him, drape a leg, nibble a ear, whisper dirty things to him.  Use your girlfriend privileges in front of her and make it pretty obvious when you two leave together you're gonna bang it out.  Rub her nose in it.  If she's into him that'll hurt, if she's not then no harm no foul for being extra flirty with your bf.  Remember you've already won.  You are the girlfriend, she is not.
mnltmh,I normally wouldn't do this but she's honestly pissed me off so much that I kinda already started doing this a little bit. I did it the last time we were all hanging out. The second she started reminiscing about stuff they did together (like she usually does when I'm around) I turned up the PDA with him. Sadly, I couldn't see the look on her face because she had a mask on.
mnltmh,My way of handling something with similarities was to say I do not want to control his friendships and I wasn't asking him to stop talking to her. Then went on to say I was underwhelmed due to X,Y, and Z behaviors.As you've already made some requests and he seems to have accommodated them I would wait for a little while though. Not to say your feelings aren't valid but give it a little more time to see how things go and try to avoid group hangouts.Some people are really that oblivious so I think it's plausible he may really not see it. If he does see it he may be ignoring it in the hopes she gets over it because he doesn't want to lose her friendship (BTDT myself) considering the history.
mnltmh,You can't tell him what he's allowed and not allowed to do. Tell him what's going on and ask him to put up boundaries.If he refuses then you know where his priorities lie.She really sucks though.
mnltmh,I find it weird that he claims to have no idea about any of itHe says he knew she was into him when they first met but he says that she's not into him anymore and that she's had multiple boyfriends since then.She needs the hint so she can get on with her life and start approaching people who are actually receptive and available.I'm pretty damn sure she knows that she's been friendzoned. That's why I'm so confused as to why she's still around so much.
mnltmh,You say you don‚Äôt want to tell him what she‚Äôs said but you can‚Äôt tell him to just drop his best friend for no reason. Honestly, telling him he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot allowed‚Äù to do anything sounds insecure and controlling and you will come off as the bad guy, no matter how valid your concerns are.You need to have a serious talk with him. Tell him what she‚Äôs said, what your concerns are and you two need to come to a joint decision on how to proceed.
mnltmh,I would just be completely honest with your partner tbh. I don‚Äôt honestly believe that your boyfriend doesn‚Äôt realise she‚Äôs into him, I think it‚Äôs more likely that he‚Äôs just ignoring it because he doesn‚Äôt want to lose her support and friendship (especially if she was the only person there through his trauma).Ultimately though, she is constantly challenging you and disrespecting your relationship, even if she is subtle and only does it to you. If your partner doesn‚Äôt care about how this upsets you then I‚Äôd start to question my priorities.In an ideal scenario you would explain to him what has been going on, and then he would ask her to back off because she is making HIM feel uncomfortable with her behaviour (this is key, it has to be from him, not requesting on your behalf). This girl is trying to make you feel intimated, and he should respond to that in a way that shows that you two are a team, and he won‚Äôt accept her undermining that.
mnltmh,Pretty sure he knows and likes it
mnltmh,Your boyfriend needs to respect how you feel no matter how difficult it is, you need to confront him about it. Otherwise, it will strain your relationship. She needs to back off. If you don't, i'll tell her for you.
mnltmh,He doesn‚Äôt want her. He‚Äôs with you. She sees that and is jealous, so she‚Äôs purposely trying to get under your skin, cuz that‚Äôs the only way she‚Äôs able to get rid of you.Let all the worst case scenarios go through your head. Sit with them. Feel how it would feel to find out they have more than just a friendship. Now look at your relationship and all the great things you‚Äôve experienced over the past 6 months with him. Don‚Äôt give power to some jealous person. If you were enjoying your relationship before this girl, you can continue to enjoy it after she‚Äôs exited herself. Which she will do once she finds something more interesting. And your reactions to her are keeping her interested.
mnltmh,hope ur bf respects you and drops her.
kqdlo8,This makes me happy and I‚Äôm happy for you. Thanks for the update.
kqdlo8,Im still with the first comment on the OP. Get this man a coffee. Girls like getting drinks/lunch just as much as guys do!!!
kqdlo8,I'm still curious from your last post about what type of industry you are in where it is totally normal to date your coworkers.  Of course I don't want you to out yourself, but do you have a similar industry to offer up as an example?  Just curious and all I can imagine is like "South Pole Research Scientist"
kqdlo8,You are honestly pretty close! Think "government-sponsored scientific research center specializing in hazardous materials." There can be security clearance issues if you're married to someone in the "wrong" field, so most of us just date each other.
kqdlo8,My thoughts were nuclear research or CDC Lab.
kqdlo8,haha I dated a guy who worked in Antarctica for years... Based on my experience, that's a perfect example! His last gf worked with him in Antarctica and basically every single one of his friends also did. Many of them were married to people they met in Antarctica. It was such a surreal friend group to be around :D
kqdlo8,When I worked for a consulting firm it was also totally fine to date a coworker.  And there were many married couples as well as a result of both working at the company.If you were dating someone and were on the same project the expectation was that you let superiors know and they would reassign people to a diff project.  If it was someone you worked for or worked for you, they would realign your formal reporting structure
kqdlo8,Dumb fact: I‚Äôm a ski instructor, and we have a bunch of relationships and marriages within ski school. But that‚Äôs because we all work independently from each other yet spend much of our time off skiing with each other.
kqdlo8,Good update I‚Äôm glad for you!
kqdlo8,Great news, good luck to you both!
kqdlo8,I'm happy for you! I hope he keeps recovering well and best of luck to you both in 2021.
kqdlo8,I remember workplace romances, good luck to you!!
kqdlo8,Thanks for posting something so positive and uplifting. Happy New Years to the two of you!
kqdlo8,Definitely bring him some coffees by the way! Stuff like that is super cute.
kqdlo8,Aww I love a happy update! Really glad it worked out and wishing you two all the best!
kqdlo8,Yay for happy updates!
kqdlo8,My wife and I met at work. We dated for three years before getting married last October. We have different responsibilities at work so it's not a problem.
kqdlo8,Aw this is cute! Wishing you the best of luck!
kqdlo8,It‚Äôs never good to get into a work place fling it really I isn‚Äôt. I remember a couple who dated and were higher ups in the management they both had a really acrimonious relationship. They had to still work together after a bad breakup. They did not interact well and meetings turned into screaming matches. The bosses over them finally shut that down. Ultimately asking the woman to leave. He most of the source of the issues got to stay. So be aware it an get messy fast
kqdlo8,ESTO ES EL ARTE DE LA INDIFERENCIA Y EL DESTINOOOOO!!!!! >:v
kxwn58,I like your husband's Grandma. "A desperate harlot" lol.
kxwn58,I would follow grandma‚Äôs lead with this one. She‚Äôs just a desperate harlot, who clearly is not winning the john she now wants, and she can only watch you live a life she feels entitled to. Being Petty is not the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù route, but is this something that will make you feel better?I will say it probably will not help your husband to engage with her or his family in any capacity.
kxwn58,My grandma is the same when it comes to my ex-wife. Don't discount old people. They've been around the block and seen a thing or two. If only I heeded her warning before proposing...
kxwn58,As my grandma was fond of saying, you can lead a horticulture but you can‚Äôt make her think...
kxwn58,Your grandma or husband should say it to her face. Tell her to leave.Her presence / comments and his lies to you are disrespectful of you and your role. You don‚Äôt introduce your wife to your ex fianc√©e and not say then or after ‚Äúby the way she‚Äôs my ex.‚Äù That‚Äôs a crazy omission and put you in a terrible position, OP. That ex knew your husband hadn‚Äôt told you and then made comments to him in front of you. Totally inappropriate.
kxwn58,Grandma must have some good pain meds üòâ
kxwn58,I could really go a desperate harlot rn.
kxwn58,He just kept insisting their engagement was a mistake.In some fairness, this sounds like an accurate and very tactful way to demonstrate grace by not throwing the witch under the bus.TALK with your husband. Explain how you feel. And see if you can come up with a solution together.
kxwn58,She's trying to get your husband's attention.  Your husband is ignoring her.  Be on your husband's side and ignore her ass and/or follow his lead to how to handle her.  You guys are a team, he loves you, be a team, together.Focus on his grandmother; you like her, focus all your efforts into helping her.  She likes you and that you're helping, and doesn't like her.
kxwn58,Be on your husband's side and ignore her ass and/or follow his lead to how to handle her.  You guys are a team, he loves you, be a team, together.This is also good advice.
kxwn58,This. I think the best thing you can do that will get her to leave both of you alone is for you to show that she doesn't bother you, even if she actually does. Getting no reaction to her immaturity is the only way to make it stop. Same idea as don't listen to a child when they're whining. Ignore it, and she'll have no reason to continue.
kxwn58,True true, but isn‚Äôt it kinda weird he never told her that she was the ex-fianc√©? If I‚Äôm reading her post right, she indicates that the husband told her he was previously engaged, but not that the person he was engaged to was also his SIL
kxwn58,she used to be engaged to my husband but broke up with him for his half-brother when my husband got disinheritedThat's hilarious. I always thought that successful golddigging required some subtlety and discretion but apparently I am naive in the ways of the world.Don't think you've got anything to worry about. Maybe be super lovey dovey when she's around, and mega congrats to your hub for dodging this woman.
kxwn58,What do you want to accomplish?  Do you want to verbally dress her down or accost her for hurting the man you love?  That will only upset your husband. She is completely and utterly shameless for what she had done; there is nothing you can say that would bother her in the least.This is your husbands family so defer to him on behaviors.  If he thinks it is best to not feed the dumpster fire that is his sister in law then do not feed it. Right now he has the moral high ground and you will only erode that in their minds by letting the SIL use your dislike of her as another angle to bother your husband.It sucks, but ignoring her is actually the worst thing you can do to her from her POV. Do not validate her existence in any way. It will crush her. It doesn‚Äôt feel as good as speaking your mind, but it is far more effective.
kxwn58,Get your husband or the grandma to tell her to leave! Sounds like the grandma doesn't want her there anyway and there's no need for 3 adults to care for one person who's bedridden but sound of mind.Your husband is a good man. She hurt him like hell and he's trying his best to be respectful even though his blood must be absolutely boiling.I'd be super lovey dovey with him. Show him you're on his side and follow his lead on how to act.
mh0zpp,Nah dude's probably just worried you'll be mad at him. Just talk to him and y'all should be able to figure it out.
mh0zpp,I wouldn‚Äôt jump to thinking he‚Äôs interested in her.  He openly shut her down and set boundaries with her.  Sounds like he cares a lot about you and didn‚Äôt want you to lose a friend.  He meant well and there should be no trust issues with him.Going forward, sit down with him and talk. Tell him you appreciate how much he cares about you.  However, tell him that in the future, you would rather he told you right away and let you set your own boundaries with this friend too.
mh0zpp,Besides its weird that he cares more about potentially saving my friendship with her than he does making sure he doesnt come off as a cheater.It's actually not at all weird that someone who isn't a cheater isn't concerned about coming off as a cheater.
mh0zpp,if you aren‚Äôt at least aware of what others might perceive your actions as, you are going to have a LOT of trouble in life.i love my SO and so i try to be aware of what he will perceive my actions as. i would not want my SO to think i have a thing for his friend bc i never told him about a perceivably ‚Äúintimate‚Äù instance that was shared with said friend.
mh0zpp,I think there are several reasons he didn't tell you and honestly you've hinted at a couple yourself. He might have thought it would get turned on him, your friends are already doing that by saying maybe he was interested, that's incredibly unfair. Leading on from that he might have thought you wouldn't believe him if he did tell you. Or he might have genuinely thought he was doing the right thing and protecting your friendship.I don't think he did anything wrong in this he didn't reciprocate at any point or cause drama. He said no put a boundary in place and moved on. To him it was dealt with.
mh0zpp,best case scenario: he was afraid of upsetting you and driving a rift between you and your friend, so he failed to tell you. that‚Äôs not a horribly unrealistic option.i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve already been dwelling on the worst so i won‚Äôt get into it. have a conversation without assuming motive on his part, and request he be more transparent with you in the future.
mh0zpp,Sit down and talk to him about it.You get where he was coming from, he wanted to avoid you hurting or avoid drama with friends - but that it isn't fair to you to take away your ability to decide whether you're ok staying her friend or not. When he doesn't tell you this stuff, he's ripping that decision away from you and making that decision for you - this isn't what partners do, it means one person gets to control the other by taking away their choices.To be a good boyfriend to you means telling you the truth, not hiding stuff from you, and letting you make your own choices. Keeping you ignorant and making your decisions for you is treating you like a child, not like a partner.
mh0zpp,I agree so much. I wrote a similar comment to another reply and I don't understand why more people can't see this or tell OP that "he doesn't have to tell her everything that happens to him". Technically true, but this is (well, was) her friend, someone she's presumably around often, she should get to make an informed decision about who she spends her time with.I don't think this is relationship breaking necessarily, but it definitely warrants a chat about how to handle things in the future.
mh0zpp,We don‚Äôt know how much time had passed here.  Maybe he was waiting for the right moment to say something or just hadn‚Äôt had time alone with her.
mh0zpp,I completely understand what you mean.  He should have told you, but a friend who will hit on him definitely won‚Äôt have an issue lying to you about what happened.  Maybe he‚Äôs not sure you‚Äôll believe him over her?
mh0zpp,Honestly, I kind of understand his pov. He probably thinks this is your good friend and he probably doesn't want to cause an issue between your friendship.Plus he turned her down.I've had a similar issue happened to me. One of my good friends (back then), her husband hit on me. The first time it happened, I thought it was because he had too much to drink (he was having wine). So I didn't say anything because I don't want to cause issues within their marriage. Then the second time, he was definitely not drinking. And he actually chatted me up (this before texting lol) online on a chat, and this was how I got proof that he was hitting on me. I told him that, hey, not cool, don't make jokes like that. And ask him if he's had drinks before. He declined all those then he went on to tell me about how lacking their sex life was, etc. Then I told her about it. She did pull back from her friendship with me because she wanted to work things out with her husband.But the point of that story is, I really didn't want to be the cause of their marriage breakup. And part of me also was afraid that she would ...' shoot the messenger' so to say. I, fortunately, did keep the evidence/receipt so she believed me.Those reasons were why I restrained myself from telling her although we were at that time, really good friends. So for me, I can totally see that it is reasonable that he didn't tell you immediately. He didn't want drama. Maybe he's super chill and non-confrontational generally. The more negative assumption is he thought that you would not believe him over your friend... because I've heard about that type of thing happening.I'd suggest just keep dating him, keep learning more about him, and if you don't want the same thing repeating, just assure him that telling you about this type of thing is ok and that you would listen to him.
mh0zpp,Could go either way.  I am inclined to give your BF the benefit if the doubt that he wanted to give the friendship a chance at surviving the girl's stupidity.  Your other friend sounds like he is jumping the gun and trying to push the guy out the door.
mh0zpp,Suppose that he comes to you and says what happened, there is a good chance that your friend makes up some story about inappropriate conduct by your boyfriend to save face and get the heat off of her (if she's ok with trying to hook up with her friends bf, is lying a big stretch from there?). Then you are in a position of choosing who to believe, and for him if you believe the friend then he's in the doghouse or worse. So keeping quiet about it and hoping nothing more comes of it is at least an understandable response from his perspective.
mh0zpp,That‚Äôs exactly what I thought. Especially as the relationship has only been a thing for 4 months. Would be worried about the friend lying and being believed over the boyfriend.
mh0zpp,This is the way I'd feel 4 months into a relationship.
mh0zpp,It sounds like there were witnesses though so it would be easy enough to disprove if she lies.
mh0zpp,If your gut is telling you something is wrong then definitely talk to him about it more.However I'm not too surprised tbh. Plenty of people will go to lengths to avoid confrontation and drama. I've especially noticed that guys want nothing to do with drama between girls (often they find it too confusing because women can be subtle with passive aggression).Have a talk about how you'd like to deal with situations like this in the future if it happens both online and irl.
mh0zpp,Is he usually this nonconfrontational? To a lot of people, the act of telling you your friend betrayed your trust is pretty difficult. I know it'd make me pretty anxious, when I was younger possibly anxious enough to hope your friend got the message and it all just goes away without having to tell you.
mh0zpp,Been in kinda the same situation and did the same thing as your boyfriend. And I learned it was the wrong thing to do. Anytime a situation happened after I made sure to tell the effected party right away. You live you learn. I‚Äôd talk to him and tell him why you‚Äôre sussed and what not
mh0zpp,he said he didn't want to ruin our friendship and that he told her if she doesn't stop being weird he'll tell me. He says he wanted to give her a shot at saving the friendship.He sounds like a keeper, really. This attitude is what I would value in a partner. At your ages, friendships are far likelier to survive long-term than romantic relationships. Obviously you can cut your friend off for whatever you like, and it sounds like she's weird about this in general.Most importantly, though, if you two never talked about these kinds of boundaries before now, he had no way to know what you would want in that situation. He's not malicious to go by what he would want in your shoes. Talk things through, figure out what kinds of boundaries you two want for the relationship.
mh0zpp,If your friend tried to get with your BF, she isn't your friend. So kudos on that.It isn't weird that he didn't tell you. Many guys don't like causing drama.
mh0zpp,I think it would be weirder if the trotted out the fact that your friend wants him. Almost like a brag. He didn't, he handled it, he has witnesses that he shut her down immediately and there was no need to stir up drama. The end.
ljjzwg,I got this vibe too, it's a manipulating way of getting a response, I'm so glad OP stuck with their plans instead of giving them what they wanted.
ljjzwg,my thoughts too, this person sounds manipulative and attention seeking.
ljjzwg,Again see my comment above, this person can‚Äôt even show you respect for your boundaries now and you barely know her, that will only get worse, run and don‚Äôt look back, she‚Äôll be fine she will find another target to pursue, you do not want to be at the mercy of this girl‚Äôs weirdness
ljjzwg,Ya gave me ick vibes too.
ljjzwg,She told you what she needed, I think it's appropriate for you to respond with what you needed. No apologies. "I'm not guarded, I really just needed a weekend to myself." I think ignoring it is just avoiding the issue.
ljjzwg,The thing is, I basically already told her that the first time when she asked about the movie night.   I guess I can reiterate it, though.
ljjzwg,Not even that specific. "I had plans this weekend." and going forward, "I already have plans." It doesn't matter that those plans involve doing Fuck and All.eta: Don't say this in a text reply today or tomorrow. Say it in slack, zoom, teams, work email, whatever medium she tries to address it in after Tuesday. In the meanwhile, mute her or even temporarily block her and enjoy your weekend.
ljjzwg,Straight forward is always the best route, imo. I think she was projecting her own insecurities. She seems to have somehow matched into you as her ‚Äúperson‚Äù for the time being in some regard.
ljjzwg,Completely agree with this comment. Be honest from the get go because I had an issue with a friend of mine a few years ago who ended up going a little crazy about spending time with me; she didn't respect who I was as a person and that I liked my down time, also liked to assume a lot of things about me when she hardly knew me.I felt awkward about being direct with her in the beginning and it ended up biting me in the ass big time.
ljjzwg,I read that more as manipulative. Like she‚Äôs purposefully telling you that you‚Äôre guarded/antisocial so you can say ‚Äúoh no, you‚Äôve got me all wrong! Let‚Äôs have a sleepover, I‚Äôll show you that I‚Äôm not‚Äù it‚Äôs kinda like a mix between forced false introspection and emotional extortion.Also the first comment about strong arming you into a sleepover absolutely reeks of desperation and if it were me, that would be the dealbreaker even without the psycho latter comment.She also hasn‚Äôt showed you yet that she would even be a good friend, and is already calling in emotional support favours. Not good.I would ignore her and revert it back to professional relationship, don‚Äôt even answer work texts at all outside of office if you can.
ljjzwg,She sounds clingy and needed but is playing it like op is the one that needs her.
ljjzwg,I completely agree, and I thought the same.Friendships have to be mutual.I think it‚Äôs fine to say that you had plans/were busy this weekend, but in the nicest way possible, tell her that you don‚Äôt need new friends at this time (especially from work) and you would prefer to be colleagues who hang out casually.Nothing more, nothing less, be honest, protect your sanity and your free time. I‚Äôve had to do this before, and it was true. (I am a person that has wayyyyy too many friends on different continents‚ÄîI am never short of social invitations.)Not to make it about me, just letting you know that I‚Äôve been in your exact shoes before, and this is how I handled it successfully.
ljjzwg,This reminds me of a friendship I had with a girl who would do things like that. If I wasn‚Äôt hanging out with her or talking to her, she would start with the calls. If I didn‚Äôt answer then texts. If I didn‚Äôt answer then the tactics to get me to respond would go on and on until I finally responded. At the very start of our friendship she wanted all of my attention. If I had any friends or boyfriends, she wanted to be included or she would throw a tantrum. After trying to make the friendship work for a year, I had to end it saying that she wanted more from me than I was willing to give. I would warn you to be a little cautious letting this person in. Keep the friendship light until you have a better understanding of who she really is.
ljjzwg,I had friends like this throughout my teens before I wised up. Oy. SO exhausting.
ljjzwg,Because you work together, it makes everything more complicated.I don't like that she is assuming things about your personality that are not only incorrect but a bit negative.I think I would just write back and say something noncommittal such as "I'm really enjoying a quiet weekend to myself. We can connect at work next week."
ljjzwg,Yes the coworker context is really important. There is a way to make friends at work, but it really has to be more cautious and slower than ‚Äúnatural‚Äù friendships in the flow of our personal life.It always surprises me when I have coworkers making friends with each other way too fast. Friendships have ups and downs. It can really hurt everyone‚Äôs professional existence if they Mix personal lives with a coworker BEFORE perfecting the on the job relationship.
ljjzwg,How you respond depends on one whether or not you're interested in pursuing a friendship with her?Without knowing her, it's hard to decipher if her messages were manipulative or not.If you want to give her the benefit of the doubt that there was some misinterpretation of your availability, then I think it's ok to ask why she thinks that, and explain yourself.  If you go this route, genuinely listen to and consider how she came to her conclusions, maybe you have body language you're not aware of OR maybe you don't and she's really bad at reading people.  But it's ok to listen to and consider feedback even if you later decide it's not helpful.  Be honest when you communicate your reasons and explain your communication preferences.If you don't want to pursue friendship with her, then you need to start setting boundaries now. Disengaging from people who try to overwhelm you is usually easiest by going 'grey rock' with them.  It's a technique people use to deal with narcissists but it's easy to use with otherwise overdramatic or pushy people too.  You basically just make yourself 'boring' to them by keeping your responses brief, neutral, and on-target.So, for this example, you could text her back (or wait to tell her at work) that you already had plans this weekend.  You CAN tell her the plans were to decompress, but it's not necessary.  Then, no matter what she says, or how she presses, you just stick to the main point that you had plans, and weren't checking your phone.  You can reiterate that as much as needed.  She might press or even get exasperated, but that's her problem, not yours.  Don't let her make you feel embarrassed to stick to only your point - you weren't available.For the record, I would feel the same way you do about her texts, they're a pretty overboard reaction.  Personally, I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who came out of the gate with 'I know you're guarded but....' because I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who sees me that way, it sounds like she's putting the onus on you to not be whatever her version of 'guarded' is, and could be used to push boundaries later.
ljjzwg,I dont really know her well enough to know if she was being manipulative either. I've honestly hung out with her outside of work a total of 3 times over the past year and 2 of those times included other people. She has always seemed nice, but the "guarded" comment was just really uncomfortable to me.
ljjzwg,> "I'm going to get you to agree to a movie night someday, I swear I'm an awesome friend."This part here made me think she is very insecure and probably thought you were closer than you actually are, or is going through something that makes her think people do not like her. But then she is kind of negging you by saying you are super guarded and do not like people (when all you say suggests otherwise), which is manipulative and I do believe she wanted to trigger a response from you and have you defend yourself - and give her a chance to interact with you. Again, and in the lack of more info, I do think she is just very insecure, thought you were closer than you actually are, and took your negative very poorly.However, in my opinion with this reaction she made sure any chance of friendship or even the continuation of your occasional get together is over, her reaction does not do ehr personality any favours. If I were you I would be super uncomfortable from now on, she is a bit too old to be so emotionally immature (assuming she is not very depressed, which is something that makes you think, say and do stuff you wouldn't otherwise - but that is not your issue to solve or be burdened with).Do you see yourself giving her a chance to see how inappropriate her reaction was, or do you feel like you really don't want to continue seeing her? Only you can answer this, but don't feel guilty if you feel like calling it quits.
ljjzwg,How did you decline her invitation in the first place? Did you say a simple "No" or did you give more context, like "No thanks, I'm really tired and want a weekend to myself"? Not saying either is wrong, just wondering what she's working off of here.I'm currently in the process of trying to back out of a toxic friendship (we're similar ages to you too and both women) that began with the other person CONSTANTLY calling, texting, asking me to hang out etc. Because I was kind of lonely during COVID I let it go on for way too long and now she thinks we're BFFs and need to talk every day, even though that's way overstepping my boundaries.It gets a lot harder to distance yourself the longer you let it go on. If you don't want to be absolute best friends who share everything with this person (which is totally fair-- that's not a great relationship to have with someone you work with for pretty obvious reasons, and this woman sounds pretty judge-y and needy which is a dangerous combo) take some serious steps back now before it gets worse, trust me. You 100% have the right to define your boundaries and cut people out the second they cross them.
ljjzwg,I told her that I was just going to lay low this weekend because I wasn't feeling great after the covid vaccine. Which was not a lie, and honestly that's why I spent a lot of yesterday being a complete bum and ignoring my phone. I wasn't specifically ignoring her (I didn't even realize she was going to be texting me throughout the day because we didn't have that kind of relationship prior). I was just doing my thing and not focused on other people in general.You're right about the setting boundaries early thing. I didn't mind her as a casual work acquaintance but I'm not really in the market for a new best friend so if thats what she is looking for, I should make it evident that I'm not it.
ljjzwg,This - it gets weirder and harder to back out the longer you let it go on. Everything gets more uncomfortable and the options on how to do it in a tactful way get fewer. Now seems to be that influx point - definitely stop it here please, definitely something you will regret not doing if you don‚Äôt. She definitely is not just going to ‚Äúsnap out of‚Äù this manipulative, attention-seeking behavior and it really can only get worse from here imo. This woman almost certainly has one, if not multiple personality disorders (this reeks of some pretty intense borderline personality) and she won‚Äôt be a pleasure to deal with if you get caught in her dramaEdit tagging OP to look into borderline personality u/panda-92
hl4bsj,I work in IT and do a lot of stuff with making sure our websites are accessible to all kinds of folks. This means the obvious things like making sure videos have captions on, that screen readers work for visually impaired folks, that the colour contrasts are good. But it also includes making sure that the language that we use is as simple and clear as possible so that people with low reading skills or English as a second language can understand it. Doing these things makes our websites better for all people, not just for the people they're aimed at.The same is true of your apartment. The lighting sounds brilliant, and ideal for anyone who is having a bad day or a headache or just fancies a different mood. And the bathroom sounds amazing. Do you want to come and design mine?The idea that thinking things that can help someone who has specific issues should only be done for them, in certain spaces, is bad. Making spaces more comfortable, accessible, and friendly is good for everyone.
hl4bsj,Precisely! It's not like I can only use one room in my own flat.Thanks for this!
hl4bsj,And who doesn‚Äôt want easy to clean counters??
hl4bsj,As someone with OCD, it is a fine line between enjoying something because it satisfies a compulsion versus enjoying it as a normal, non-loaded task.  If her boyfriend is in therapy, I can almost guarantee that he‚Äôs not supposed to do anything that feeds the intrusive thoughts.When my husband and I were just dating, he did a lot like OP to make me feel comfortable (but specific to my rituals). God, I loved it. I loved it so much. But all it does is make me backslide.So, if it just makes OP‚Äôs boyfriend happier because those things sound great, then awesome. But if he enjoys them because they sooth and quiet the intrusive thoughts, then it‚Äôs actually not in her boyfriend‚Äôs best interest.She really needs to talk to him to know how this impacts his OCD and his journey to getting better.
hl4bsj,Such a great philosophy. Prioritising accessibility in design benefits everyone. I love that you brought this up because it applies to this situation perfectly!
hl4bsj,I say this all the time, but lightbulbs and staircases are accommodations. We‚Äôve just been trained to see them as necessary.
hl4bsj,You have a dimmer switch for the lights and a nice bathroom.  What on earth is A‚Äôs problem?! End the friendship.  It‚Äôs not like you got rid of all upholstered surfaces and replaced them with disposable furniture you throw away weekly!
hl4bsj,haha, what a peculiar method. Yeah, frankly If anything I relish all those changes probably more than my bf.
hl4bsj,Right? I don't have OCD and I was here thinking "damn, I wish I had a cozy bathroom and a light switch like that".
hl4bsj,Yeah, your friend seems like they're an asshole. You made some relatively minor changes in your home (which do not hinder you in any way) to accommodate someone you care about - I mean, easy to clean surfaces help you. Is your friend usually this lacking in empathy?
hl4bsj,not that I'm aware of, that's why these hostile remarks surprised me that much
hl4bsj,I will say this as a person with OCD.  Aga is not a mental health professional.  She is ignorant of how OCD works and of how mental illnesses are treated in the 21st Century.  Her suggestion that your boyfriend should be tortured with ‚Äúshock treatment‚Äù is monstrous.  Her opinions are trash and deserve no respect.Please do not bring Aga near your boyfriend ever again.
hl4bsj,If you lived in a wheelchair accessible house, would that be pandering to a disability? Should you make someone struggle to stand because YOU think it's better, despite what the actual doctors say? Obviously not. Mental illnesses are illnesses."Aga, I'm not willing to have this conversation. You aren't a licensed therapist with experience treating this illness, so your opinion is neither useful nor wanted. Kindly never mention it again." And if she mentions it again, the conversation is abruptly over. She makes ANY comment about his illness or the way you two handle it, you just get up and leave, or hang up the phone.Or, y'know, just cut her off entirely because she sounds like trash.
hl4bsj,Of course! If people just followed the Aga Method(patent pending) and removed all wheelchair accessible features, then the disabled people would be forced to stop being lazy and start walking again! We need to stop enabling their disabilities!
hl4bsj,I have OCD and I have to say, it's different. I can understand where Aga is coming from though she is severely misunderstanding how OCD treatment works. If you give into compulsions and build your life around them, OCD can get much worse.I do a type of therapy called exposure and response prevention where I deliberately expose myself to things that trigger my ocd, in a therapeutic setting or for periods of time at home. It works really well,  and lessens the power of the compulsion.Maybe Aga thinks that OP is enabling avoidance that will make her bf less able to handle normal life. She's wrong, however.  Just like someone recovering from major surgery shouldn't do physical therapy every waking moment, people with OCD don't need to exposure work constantly. A relaxing OCD friendly space can help him rest and recuperate between sessions of therapy. It can only help.Finally, untreated and unchecked OCD (which is not what the boyfriend has, he sounds like he's managing it really well) will find a problem with ANY environment. Even the easiest to clean home would still have him sanitizing every surface and mopping twice a day or whatever if his symptoms were unmanaged. It's not "hating a messy house" it's irrational magical thinking and compulsions that intrude out of nowhere and it will find issue with even the cleanest space because it isn't about the mess, not really.Tldr: the friend is wrong, but I think she might have a partial understanding of how avoidance can make OCD worse and she's just ignorant, not malicious or ableist.
kzuu0c,This is a LOT, and honestly you should probably be talking to a therapist or psychiatrist about this, because randos on Reddit are really not qualified to give you the psychological advice you need. That said, psychological advice (to take with a large handful of salt) incoming:It sounds like your friend is coping with her trauma in some deeply unhealthy ways. From what you‚Äôve described, this actually DOESN‚ÄôT sound to me like most cases of elaborate inventive lies for attention that I‚Äôve heard of ‚Äî she‚Äôs not constantly inventing drama and disasters or plot twists to keep everyone‚Äôs attention on her, and she is genuinely supportive and helpful of you, not asking you to make crazy sacrifices for her fictional needs. It sounds more like she desperately wants to be living a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù happy life and has taken that desire way too far. The most concerning part of the whole to me is the stalking and harassment of her ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù ‚Äî with everything else you could argue there‚Äôs no actual harm done (except the emotional harm and the destruction of your trust in her), but that isn‚Äôt okay. I don‚Äôt think you necessarily need to drop her as a friend, but it seems like a good idea at this point to gently suggest to her that she needs to see a therapist and find healthier ways of working through her issues.
kzuu0c,I agree. It seems to me like this girl has some serious mental issues, but the lies might not be cut from whole cloth. The first thing that I imagined is that she may have miscarried and been dumped, sending her into full denial mode about how her life was going to be from then on.
kzuu0c,Ya‚Äôll were troubled kids and could relate to one another. But now are adults dealing with the psychological repercussions of everything that happened, and everyone copes differently. You both could benefit from therapy. Only a professional could help both of you with your traumas.
kzuu0c,I agree neither of these two people feels healthy.
kzuu0c,I was gonna say, it feels like the only thing these two women have in common at all is trauma. And clearly this friend is processing it...very differently from OP.It‚Äôs genuinely sad that she‚Äôs gone down this path, but I‚Äôm at a total loss as to what OP could actually do to help her. The denial runs deep and OP has no authority or leverage to force help on this woman. She very much seems the type to just disappear the moment she feels like she‚Äôs busted. If grandma‚Äôs not able or willing to step in, I don‚Äôt think OP has any real options for helping her.
kzuu0c,As her belly grew...Did you actually witness her belly growing? Did it look like a pregnant belly or did she simply gain weight? I know women all carry babies differently, so it could be plausible to mistake fat for pregnancy, but I‚Äôm also wondering about the possibility of a real miscarriage. It was at about 6 months when she disappeared from view for a bit. Perhaps she lost the baby and coped with her grief by nurturing the dolls and had a complete mental break from reality. If the pregnancy was real I would also question the circumstances around the father, and whether or not it was her ex or someone more sinister.
kzuu0c,This is a very good point.
kzuu0c,i dont have any good advice because this is a really complicated situation. i cant even imagine what you must be going through. it seems like your friend is very troubled and was trying to cope with whatever it is she went through by almost creating a perfect life for herself. i dont know if its true but reading this made me wonder if she actually wants to tell the truth, but feels that shes so far deep in her lies it would be incredibly difficult to admit what she had done. i think you should take care of yourself right now and if you feel comfortable and have the strength maybe reach out to her and tell her that you know she was lying. she may honestly be very relieved that you figured it out and that she doesnt have to lie to you anymore. im very sorry that youre going through this.
kzuu0c,I second this ^ ‚Äòyour friend may be relieved that she can stop lying‚Äô but remember that you need to be focused on protecting yourself first; and so I think it may provide you with some closure by letting her know that You know. Though speaking with a counselor or therapist or if you‚Äôre religious, even a pastor may help you find better guidance in this matter than I. Good luck OP.
kzuu0c,I‚Äôm a school psychologist, who works in a high school setting. Being ‚Äòheld back‚Äô in high school, especially more than once, is very uncommon. If she was indeed getting Special Education Services, she would have been able to continue going to school and getting help until she either got her diploma or turned 22, whichever came first. This is much longer than a regular education student would be able to stay on a high school campus. We have a small handful of general education students who need an extra year, but beyond that, they would normally go to an adult school. My guess is, she had a lot more problems than she ever made you aware of. You were younger, inexperienced, and going through plenty of your own trauma. She has been careful to project a certain image to you. She‚Äôs the mama friend. She has it all under control. She doesn‚Äôt sound like she ever wanted you to see her as just as lost as you were. The kind of help she needs is well beyond what you can do for her. She needs access to mental health support from a professional. None of us know you two or can say what would happen if you confronted her with this directly, but from what you‚Äôve said, I think you should be cautious about that. The way you see her sounds very important to her. Knowing that you know all this, might be quite a blow. If you can, see a therapist yourself. You might either gain some insight here, or even be able to let her know that you have been getting counseling, and it‚Äôs been helpful, and mention it to her and ask her if she would be interested in going to counseling too. Good luck to you both. This is a lot to handle.
kzuu0c,2nd the mental health issues after adolescence. Had a friend I met at 17 who definitely had some mental health issues, but they were minor. At 26 he is now in prison/psych ward for some very serious stuff related to very significant mental health issues.People with mental illness typically get much worse around the age of 25 as this is when the human brain goes through its last stages of development.Now, I'm not saying your friend will end up like mine, but it often gets worse at this age.
kzuu0c,i‚Äôd just like to say that the current girlfriend of the ex boyfriend is probably not that much of a drama queen, given your friend‚Äôs tendencies and even her grandmother saying she stalks him, what the girlfriend is saying doesn‚Äôt sound far fetched at all. I think you still want to think of her as positively as you can, but be realistic about this. With all of her other behaviour sexual harassment lines up. Like everyone else has said, please try and get some therapy, everything you have described is awful to have to go through.
kzuu0c,I would talk to a professional about possible dependency issues. The way you talk about your friend doesn‚Äôt really sound healthy (regarding her as like a mom or like a god) and this is an issue that‚Äôs better explored earlier than later
kzuu0c,In the last 12-15 years my sister who has bipolar disorder has had a history of making things up like this. I wasn't sure for a while whether or not she was actually delusional, or what, but she was going through a painful divorce and kept claiming that her ex-husband got her pregnant despite having had her tubes tied.She exaggerated her relationship with a guy who basically showed up at her house for sex, and made up a story about him planning to marry her and that he was sending his kids over to stay with her in the U.S. (He was from another country). I messaged him and asked him about it because I didn't believe her, she became furious.She also lied and said she had a boyfriend who was an FBI agent, and made fake FB posts about gifts he bought her.Over time I had to think back to some of the other stories she'd told and realized she'd made up a lot of things to get attention.I asked a counselor about it at some point and he said that it was entirely a matter of her wanting positive attention in the moment because her life was too much to handle so she dissociated from it. All of the stories fulfilled some kind of narrative that she wanted at the time. A connection to her ex, validation from a  guy who didn't really care about her, and an elevation in her status by way of a partner who was respectable.I'm so sorry you have had the image of your friend changed, but it's likely that she did some of these things because she wanted to be perceived as someone who had a partner and family. It doesn't change who you are, or how she cared about you, it's likely about how she viewed herself as 'Not enough'.
kzuu0c,Just write her a note telling her you know the truth and that you don‚Äôt judge her or feel angry, that you love her and want to see her, and that you haven‚Äôt told anyone the truth. If she doesn‚Äôt want to see you that‚Äôs okay. I would send her a few notes but don‚Äôt push it. But that‚Äôs kind of all you can do. If she does invite you over I wouldn‚Äôt play into her fantasy too much by pretending the dolls are real, though obviously don‚Äôt also go out of your way to shatter the illusion. Just ask her how she‚Äôs feeling and what she wants for the future and how you can help her :)
kzuu0c,I think it's pretty clear that OP is feeling (an understandable amount) of anger about this situation, and denying herself the grieving process in order to mollify this potentially dangerous friend (the severe stalking and harassment, the ease of lying) could be very harmful.I don't think OP is equipped to handle this situation alone. They are going to need the guidance of a mental health professional to keep from getting hurt again if they intend to reengage.
kzuu0c,You need to ask yourself if you want to continue a relationship with her.  It sounds like you do and love her greatly.  So if you are going to remain friends...you need to say you don't want any lies in your life and only an honest relationship.  But the problems are deeper than anything you can do, this is like major red flag weird behaviors.  In that case, she needs to get some help before you can be friends with her again.In high school I was friends with these girls and I made up lots of lies about myself about how I have these cool guitars, etc.  And eventually they figured it out and kind of ruined our friendship.  They called me out on it and was like you don't have those guitars.  You are just making this up. And I felt like an idiot and it was a weird thing I did.
kzuu0c,Okay, shocking! She was/is a sick person who lied about herself. Not healthy for you, as you now know. First things first: not your fault! Not your fault that she lies or that you didn't magically detect it. Second: it sounds like the one thing she was applying herself to was caring for you and (yeah, twisted) trying to provide some safety.  Of course you leaned on that. Who wouldn't?Youre going to have a lot of feelings about this and thats okay too. Mourning a close friendship is sad and your experience of her was a close supportive friend. Some of that was real!I hate to yell THERAPY but this one is so complex I'm yelling: Therapy!
kzuu0c,I think it‚Äôs important that you realize your friend is still your friend. This doesn‚Äôt change all she‚Äôs done for you.Your friend needs help. Professional help. It sounds like her life derailed so badly that she literally made up a new one. The one she wishes she had.It starts with her just wanting everyone to think she has the life she wanted, but it can quickly become a straight delusion.Six years of family wasn‚Äôt taken from you. Your family just needs you now. I wish I knew how to suggest to approach her about it. But she really needs her friend.Sometimes even the ones we look up to stumble.
kzuu0c,I was majorly manipulated by someone who ended up comitting terrible crimes against my family, and any sort of legal trouble around sexual abuse is very alarming. I did not find out about my abusers past crimes until it was too late, I know you feel crushed and lost but to you, your friend was kind. It's time to end this chapter for your safety, in my opinion.If you really want to stay in touch, the grandmother is probably a good way... but with what you've been told, you may want to consider your own safety and well being. Sending love and support through my message ‚ù§ it's eye opening to see someone differently, but it's for the best.
kzuu0c,Honestly it sounds like she is really troubled but apart from her lies she‚Äôs tried to be good friend to you. She hasn‚Äôt been trying to hurt anyone with her lies, it sounds like she has just got caught up in a fantasy. She will probably need your support now.
kzuu0c,But she has‚Äîshe‚Äôs stalking and harassing the guy she claimed was her partner. It‚Äôs best to deal with your feelings now, and probably at a distance. You are going to feel grief, anger and confusion. Go through all the feelings. Process them with a therapist if at all possible. You have been violation by a trusted older person, who deliberately put herself in an authority and caregiving role in your friendship. I am so very sorry this happened to you. Please stay safe and take very gentle care of yourself. Remember that you did not deserve to be treated like this. You deserve honest, open and loving friendships, and you will find them.
kzuu0c,I think the guy she's been aggressively stalking for years has probably been hurt by this the most.
kzuu0c,Apologies in advance for this essay but I'll try to break it down:There are a lot of things to consider in your post:-She was held back multiple times which hints towards possible learning disabilities / mental health problems.-Faking a pregnancy in high school.-Faking another pregnancy after the first.-Lying about every aspect of your life including where you live, and who your with.-Allegedly sexually harasses and stalks her ex. You dismiss this because his GF is "over dramatic" but there is a reason that the ex is with this girl and not your friend. Your friend is living an entire lie, do not be so quick to dismiss what others say just because you see your friend as a "god". The stalking and hacking is also confirmed by her own grandmother.-Life long trauma on both your parts.-She was a good friend to you through all of this.The one thing that is true is that she was a supportive friend to you through everything you went through but the hang up is; does that negate the fact that every aspect of her life is a lie? to me: no.I would say that out of the appreciation of what she has done for you over the years that it would be best to confront her, tell her you know and recommend she get professional help and be the support for her that she was to you but with what the GF of her ex and her grandmother have said, I would actually not recommend this.At the very least your friend is a compulsive liar and at its worst she is manipulative and abusive, whether these things are due to trauma/ mental health doesn't mean she should not be held accountable for what she is/has been doing. The reality is that you have no idea about  what her life is like unless you witnessed it yourself. She may have been lying about everything the whole entire time, she may have been telling the truth at one point but then started and continued a lie but either way she has proven she isn't trustworthy now.I see the argument that her lies aren't hurting anyone but I don't think that's true. She likely would have had her ex believing that he would be a father but at some point he would have found out that was a lie, think about how much that would hurt. Thinking you were going to be a dad but finding out your GF lied for seemingly no reason, the emotional turmoil. Even you, you thought one of these kids was names after you, look how hurt you are now to find out that none of this is real.I think you should quietly go no contact and slowly drift out of her life to avoid a big blow up that could make you a target. The Grandmother confirmed that she is in trouble for stalking and hacking, and the GF claims there was also sexual harassment. Now this is an assumption but for me it is not that crazy to think that the girl who lied about having two separate babies might sexually harass the "father" of those fake babies, to have an actual baby.You can assume that all the deleted FB comments from the ex-BF were probably actually her, and that she was stalking him and hacking his facebook. I will again assume that finding out a pregnancy is fake probably leads to quite a rocky end to a relationship, based on what grandma said she probably started pretending to be him online and stalked him. While commenting online seems pretty harmless you have no idea how having these random and untrue comments show up on his FB might have impacted him/ his life. This plus the added mental stress of being stalked by an ex, which you also don't know what she did so you have no idea how "bad" your friend may actually be.I don't think you should try to help her mainly to avoid making yourself her target like her ex, she clearly goes to pretty extreme extents to try to get what she wants. Ultimately she was an older sister figure that you idolized due to your similar trauma's but that trauma has led your friend to dig themselves quite the hole. The thing is, while your friend deserves help, she is an adult and is still responsible for what she does to other people. She is also potentially dangerous and it is not up to you to fix her or defend her.I think it is time to look back on the support she provided you with appreciation but close that chapter. You obviously have your own traumas to work through and I hope you do, please seek out professional help for yourself if you are not already. At 20 years old it is time to make sure you are okay before someone else, especially someone where you don't actually know if the things you do know are true.
mdmfet,I honestly think that that your friend is the one who should be reaching out to you because he is the one in the wrong. You shouldn't feel guilty or like you're the one to blame. I honestly can't be friends with someone who flirts with my bf and says they have feelings for them but if you think you can then by all means reach out to him but don't feel like you should be the one apologizing.
mdmfet,I don‚Äôt know why I feel guilty. Maybe because I saw the blatant flirting abd didn‚Äôt do much to stop it. The times I tried he told me that was just his personality. To be fair I‚Äôve seen him flirt with others but in retrospect it‚Äôs mainly people who fit my bfs type (in short; more bottomy guys lol) so I guess in hindsight I should‚Äôve realized his excuses were false and he just had an attraction to my bf
mdmfet,I wouldn‚Äôt reach out. Harry can think about what he did, and if he‚Äôs a good friend, he would apologize for breaching his best friends intimate relationship.Up to you if you decide to be friends again. I personally wouldn‚Äôt.Sure, he has feelings, he could have talked to you about them (since y‚Äôall so close) not flirt and admit them to the love interest (your bf) hoping for a slim reciprocation.He can control his actions. People do it alllll the time.I would stay away. My best friend would not have done that. Don‚Äôt hold on to people just because you‚Äôve known them a while or are in short supply.
mdmfet,Yeah, it‚Äôs fair for him to have feelings, but for him to act one them is a breach of boundaries, disrespect to you and your relationship. HEs In the wrong and should be apologizing
mdmfet,Yeah now that o think about it he never actually apologized and instead kind of defended his actions. I think I‚Äôll at least have a talk with him if he ever reaches and and ask him wth he was thinking.
mdmfet,If you‚Äôre in love with your best friend‚Äôs partner, you don‚Äôt tell the partner. You don‚Äôt put that on them or your friend. Yeah, you can‚Äôt help your feelings, but also it‚Äôs your responsibility to manage your feelings and how you act on them. Harry is the one who owes you an apology. He threw a grenade into you relationship.As for advice: I think at this point it‚Äôs time to try to make some new friends. And believe me, I know that‚Äôs really hard to do as an adult, pandemic or not. But just like how you don‚Äôt want to put everything on your BF, you should never put all of your friendship on one specific person. Maybe start spending some time in some online groups focused around a hobby of yours, or depending on your area, hit up some safe, socially-distanced meetups.
mdmfet,I think you are disrespecting your boyfriend if you continue to be friends with this guy. Is your boyfriend supposed to be comfortable if this guy starts hanging around again?
mdmfet,i don‚Äôt plan on ever having him come over and hang around again. i probably should‚Äôve said that in the post.i wanted him to be my friend again but keep them separated which my bf agrees to. though we both came to the conclusion that if he did apologize we‚Äôd talk to him together and set firm boundaries.
mdmfet,I think he would‚Äôve taken him if my bf reciprocated. Which kind leaves me with an icky feeling. My bf told me Harry said ‚Äúif you break up with -my name- you can move in with me‚Äù so he was fully planning to take on a full relationship with my bf.I‚Äôve tried to get into stuff like that. But I‚Äôm really shy around other people. It‚Äôs hard for me to talk to them in person . But I hope therapy will help me reach out to others more.
mdmfet,Im a gay man and this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of yours never respected your relationship.Evident by him flirting in front of you on your boyfriend, not stopping even when you told him to stop.This person is not your friend. If he were he would have told you first and maybe asked for some distance so he could get over those feelings. Instead he tried to steal your bf.You will be doing yourself and your relationship a disservice by letting him back into your life.
mdmfet,His best case scenario of confessing his feelings to your boyfriend was that he'd steal your boyfriend. Every other scenario just ends in confusion and just pushes an awkward emotional burden into you and your boyfriend. It wasn't fair of him to confess to your boyfriend while he was in a commited relationship.
mdmfet,Harry is trying to break the bro code on a whole different level.
mdmfet,He can't control his feelings, but he can control his reaction to them and his actions.Your friend told your boyfriend about his feelings because he hoped your boyfriend might reciprocate. That's not something friends do.
mdmfet,Harry is a bad friend. He can't control how he feels but he had the choice to:Flirt with your bf or not to flirt - he chose to flirt Confess his feelings to your bf or not confess - he chose to confess Talk to you and explain he needed to step away, or not talk to you - he chose not to talk to youHis actions make it pretty clear that he doesn't care about your feelings at all. He flirted, he went to your bf instead of you - which, what was his expected outcome? That your bf would break up with you and start dating him - and when you confront him, he doubles down and instead of apologizing, acts like he has no control.Don't feel bad. You can find other friends, even as an introvert. Trust me, I have 3 amazing friends and I'm a super introvert.
mdmfet,i‚Äôm pretty sure he expected my bf to leave me for him. he even said my bf could move in with him when he broke up with me so he was planning way ahead.
mdmfet,Harry breached your trust, and should never have behaved like that, let alone told your boyfriend he had feelings. Totally inappropriate. I wouldn‚Äôt forgive them if any of my friends behaved like that
mdmfet,that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm afraid of. they share a class because they are both in the same major and stuff. before he admitted to him he had constantly been asking my boyfriend for help even though he‚Äôs smarter than my boyfriend (bfs words not mine) and honestly most times ended up correcting my bf on things he messed up on.i feel like it‚Äôs as just an excuse to talk to my bf one on one. in fact the day he asked to meet up with my bf to confess to him he had bf that he just needed help with a project they had to work on.as more comments keep coming i‚Äôm leaning more towards not letting this guy back into my life as all the red flags are hitting me one after another.
mdmfet,You shouldn't feel like shit if your bf has told you that he's with you and there is nothing to worry about.You or your bf can't help if other people like you, you can only help if you stay faithful to each other.
mdmfet,So depending on if I think you should reach out or not depends on what his intent was. Forgive me if you mentioned I‚Äôm pretty tired atm lol. So anyways what I mean, is when he confessed to your bf, if it was one of those things were you just need to get it off your chest and lift the weight and move forward. Or if it was in hopes he‚Äôd leave you for him. Regardless it was still crossing a pretty universal line, but one is more understandable than the other.If his intend was ‚Äúgood‚Äù then I think you can reach out to him. Maybe talk to him 1 on 1 first then all 3 of you talk, or just however works for you all and is the most beneficial. Set boundaries and hear each other out. Odds are he will get over the crush he has on him. The feelings won‚Äôt be reciprocated and I‚Äôm sure at some point his feelings will just fade or he‚Äôll meet someone new. And I think y‚Äôall can still have a friendship. It might be a little awkward and on the slow side for a bit, but these things do happen.Now, if he was fully trying to like steal your boyfriend and hope he‚Äôd just up and leave you, I personally wouldn‚Äôt reach out. That says a lot about his character. No he can‚Äôt help how he feels, but he is in control of his actions and that‚Äôs a huge violation of trust and crossing major boundaries. Maybe if some time goes by and he apologizes and reaches out to you and y‚Äôall move past it, it can work out. But in this scenario I would personally only accept and move forward if he was the one to reach out and realize what a crappy thing he did was. People do make mistakes but it‚Äôs how they handle them that can speak even higher volumes than the mistake itself. But personally this would be something that would be very hard for me to forgive and regain trust.And just to add, I totally get how much it sucks to lose such a good friend and feel like you don‚Äôt really have anyone. But remember there will be opportunities, there‚Äôs tons of great people out there and your bound to make friends one way or another. Don‚Äôt feel you need to keep someone toxic or someone‚Äôs who‚Äôs hurt/betrayed you in your life for the fear of being alone. It won‚Äôt be a solid friendship.Maybe take a little more time to really think about what‚Äôs best for you and your relationship and make your decision from there.PS your shout out to your bf was super cute haha wish you both the best!
mdmfet,I hate to admit his intention was not good.He fully wanted my bf to drop me and even offered to have him move on with him since bf lives with me. He even told him how he could treat him like how he deserves to which my bf told him he was in a very healthy relationship.I know I shouldn‚Äôt forgive this. Someone who was willing to take the person I love away from me. But in a strange way I feel like I‚Äôm partly responsible for not catching into his feelings from the flirting and stuff like that.I think I‚Äôm going to wait for him to reach out to ME first. And give him a chance to apologize in his own before I talk to him again.
mdmfet,So he thought it was okay to try and steal his best friend's boyfriend? Why would you want this person in your life when they've shown you that they have no morals?
nw4gtj,I‚Äôll offer a different point - I am tactile with my friends too of both genders. Been cuddled by them before, lightly touch them, hold their hands, so for me it‚Äôs not that strange behaviour. Now that I have a boyfriend, I‚Äôm much more conscious of doing that with my guy friends, because I feel it is inappropriate. You need to explain your point of view and your feelings. Maybe not so much about jealousy, but phrasing it as showing respect for your romantic relationship and so others don‚Äôt get the wrong idea
nw4gtj,I‚Äôll add to this. I am pretty tactile with my friends / ( i have balance issues so sometimes even just sitting up straight next to them can feel exhausting and I‚Äôll lean on them a lil bit)I have guy friends who have entered relationships what have you and they‚Äôre innate response to these behaviors changes. Rather than opening themselves up to it / touching my hair/ etc they will more shift themselves so we are both comfortable but it‚Äôs a ‚Äúthis is happening bc we both understand xyz‚Äù rather than giving any sort of emotional connection or closeness out of it (which is what your bf is giving to that girl. )That‚Äôs my two cents.
nw4gtj,This will be my answer as well.When you're single , you can be as touchy and tactile as you are allowed to be with your friends.But when you or they get into relationships that kind of stuff should be put to a minimum or even stopped, out of respect to the partner you are now with... Unless somehow your partner is okay with all this.
nw4gtj,I really like this. And it doesn't need to be a big deal. If his friend sits on his lap after a moment he could say "you know, my gf really likes you and is really happy we are friends. I don't want to give her any reasons to ever feel otherwise and I worry if she saw a pic of you sitting on my lap it wouldn't convey the right message." A good friend would be a little abashed and then say "omg of course! Yeah she doesn't seem like the jealous type but I could see how this could look very couple-ish."
nw4gtj,Yeah I agree, it's about respect for the relationship, but I also think it's important to talk about with your partner what they are comfortable with. It could be that your partner is fine with it or at least with parts of it.People just have really different ideas about what's appropriate and what isn't and that should be discussed in a relationship. Like I don't think it's weird she fell asleep on his lap, but I think it's weird he petted her hair and had his hand on her thigh. I can't really explain why, but leaning on each other and stuff is platonic for me, while the petting and hand on the thigh is more of a relationship thing. Other people might think all of it is inappropriate, others might think none of it is.I think it also makes a difference how people generally behave, if that makes any sense. My bf isn't really tactile with female friends, so if he started doing that I'd be more concerned than if he just always did that.What is important is talking to each other and everyone involved, also the friends, should respect the set boundaries.
nw4gtj,Second this. As soon as I‚Äôm in a relationship or they got into a relationship, we would start to have some boundaries. It is also mean to be being respectful to our SO.
nw4gtj,To me that sounds a bit strange. It's great that your bf has friends of both genders, however, when you are in a relationship, the decent thing to do is consider your partners feelings. For example, I (25F) have a great childhood friend (25M). We used to hang out one on one loads and have always been quite tactile. Now that he has a gf and I have a bf our dynamic has changed a bit: we still hang out often, but I personally wouldn't spend the night at his place anymore one-on-one. My friend was originally surprised at this change, he said it's not like either of us would be tempted to cheat, we're like siblings. But I said it's not about us being tempted, it is about loving and honoring our partners and not making them worry. Maybe what you and your bf need is to have a genuine chat about boundaries with friends. Pick a time when you are both in a good mood and when you feel a bit calmer about things and discuss what is appropriate or not for both of you. And no, it definitely isn't crazy to want your boyfriend to stop  petting other girls hair or letting another girl lie in his lap.
nw4gtj,Also would he act like that in front of her? That‚Äôs the question. It seems a bit affectionate.
nw4gtj,This. It‚Äôs absolutely about respect.
nw4gtj,Best comment here ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
nw4gtj,I find it sad that straight people can't hang out alone with their friends anymore because they're dating someone.
nw4gtj,I understand that you aren't asking if you're right or wrong about it. In my opinion the way you two dealt with it so far has been great - he did something wrong, you was not happy with it, he apologized and said he won't do it anymore. What you're asking now is how you can move on from it and stop thinking about it yourself, right?Well, I'm sorry but it isn't easy. First, listen to that inner voice telling you to stop. If you give in to the bad thoughts and start feeding into them, you'll just get more and more annoyed. Start telling yourself to stop, it's not worth it, it's over and you and him can move on- no use being annoyed at the past.Second, try to find out why. You have a pretty sweet memory of you two when you started dating. Was just the motion of you having your head on his lap that made it special, or was the feeling involved with it, the glances you two gave one another, how safe, happy, in love you two felt at that moment? If it's the second case, remind yourself that he and her didn't feel anything like that, and that he won't let it happen again anyway.If you still can't let go of it no matter what, you might not be able to be with your bf. If this kind of thing happens often, that you get one bad thing that happened and can't get out of your mind, you might consider therapy - for yourself, not because you weren't right at being annoyed by what happened because he did mess up, but because maybe you need help learning to move on.
nw4gtj,Thank you so much.
nw4gtj,Okay yes, any of these behaviors can be normal in a platonic relationship but dating in my 20s basically taught me that yes its normal/comfortable but it also stops being appropriate when it makes your SO uncomfortable. I had close relationships with many people like this and dated through them but when I met my current partner, the trust and respect were building between eachother is simply MORE IMPORTANT and its worth changing some of my behavior over. Bottom line, maybe its platonic but it's disrespectful.
nw4gtj,Holy shit I just realized how old you both are, it literally sounded like he was 19 and you were his first girlfriend.
nw4gtj,My husband and I had this problem when we first started dating.  I was, and still am, a very tactile person.  I'd hold hands with friends, let them lay their heads in my lap and laying my head in theirs, I gave fantastic back/shoulder massages, most of the pictures of me show me cuddled up under someone arms with my back pressed to their side, kissed the tops of friend's heads, etc.My husband was not like that.  He felt like I was in a relationship with everyone and we didn't have anything that was a special gesture just between us. I didn't know about this for the first year or so we were together, then one day he just broke down crying and told me how insecure it made him feel.  How he understood I wasn't cheating or trying to hurt him and he didn't want to guilt me into changing such a big aspect of my personality.  I felt like such shit.  I never even considered how he would feel.  But I also knew I would be unhappy not being tactile with my friends.  It was really hard to figure out how to compromise so we both felt heard and validated and neither of us was uncomfortable.The first thing we did was sit down and I told him how I see the physical touching we do differently than the physical touching I experience with others.  When I hold hands with friends it's because it's fun to do with people, when I hold his hand it's because I want HIM, I'm seeking him out specifically.  When I put my head on a friend's shoulder it's because I'm tired or have a headache.  When I put my head on his shoulder it's because I love him and I want us to be comfortable together.  In the end I compared it to the way I am around my family and that made a lot of sense.  Most people wouldn't be upset if their partner's sibling wasn't feeling well and laid their heads in the partner's lap for a nap.  Or be upset with a quick peck on the cheek.  But I understand that while I see close friends and family as basically the same group, my husband sees them as two separate groups.  In one it is okay to be more intimate, in the other it's less acceptable.Then I told him about all the (nonsexual) ways only he is allowed to touch me.  No one is allowed to put their hand on my back except my husband.  No one touches my hair (barring the occasional "I just got this new product! Feel how soft my hair is!") except my husband.  No one is allowed to touch my feet except my husband.  This isn't something he asked me to do or that was expected of me. It was something that came naturally in our relationship.  My husband has my absolute and complete trust in a way no one ever has and I was comfortable letting him touch me in ways I wouldn't allow from anyone else, he had no idea.  That alone did a lot to help put his mind at ease.The last thing we did was discuss what he was and wasn't okay with in the context of our relationship and WHY. The why is extremely important because if I didn't agree with his reasoning, we would discuss and find a solution that worked for both of us.  Sometimes that was modifying my behavior, sometimes it was modifying his expectations, sometimes it was discussing whether it was the action that made him uncomfortable or whether it was the most obvious example of an issue/insecurity he had with our relationship.  In the end we were both able to compromise and agree on boundaries that made us both comfortable in our relationship.TL;DR If you trust him and you know he isn't cheating just talk to him.  But also understand you cannot ask him to change a very big aspect of his personality without being willing to change as well.
nw4gtj,Sounds like you have a really great, healthy, communicative relationship and I hope I can find someone I can have this with!
nw4gtj,This is very strange behaviour I mean yeah he might not be doing anything with them but just a little bit weird in my opinion for a man in a relationship to allow for such touchy-feely situations to happen. Plus why was he going on a get away with just two girls? Not saying it‚Äôs not allowed but it is kinda weird
j307yo,This. OP, just expand your "agree to disagree" stance to taking your own photos. Since it's already known you both prefer different artistic styles, he shouldn't take it personally - he does his "art", you do yours.
j307yo,Do this, and if it truly is agree to disagree, he can't have a problem with it.  You prefer your style, you respect he prefers his, any point of pride should be able to be soothed.
j307yo,Very good advice. I would like to understand why it's so important to him. Have you ever asked what got him into the passion of his? I'm thinking, maybe it is something he used to do with his grandmother or ... idk
j307yo,This. My wife takes terrible pictures. She just does. Bad angle, off-center, with filters.I take all the photos and video I want and just ignore her stuff ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
j307yo,Sometimes it is hard to take advice from loved ones where advice from a stranger or expert may be well received. Have you thought about taking a photography course together and let the instructor give the advice instead of you? You might also learn a few new tricks too.
j307yo,50/50 it just turns into calling the instructor a hack and a fraud, but I think you are right sometimes this stuff is best from a stranger.Dies he have any ambition related to photography or dies he just want people to think of him and a photographer?
j307yo,It makes a huge amount of sense that his other hobbies are building PCs and woodworking. It seems like he's approaching photography exactly the same way he approaches these other hobbies but obviously what he's missing is that photography is more art than science, more heart than brain. It seems like he's trying to use photography to capture "reality" in a very precise, analytical way but he doesn't understand the emotion that comes as part of it.
j307yo,It seems to me like he looks at photography as a way to record the fact of an event (thus the frustration over backgrounds being blurry, it obscures who else was there) whereas most people appreciate that modern photography is an artistic venture.
j307yo,There is nothing wrong with using "photography to capture "reality" in a very precise, analytical way." That's a 100% legitimate approach.His mistake, though, is looking at a subjective medium and believing that there is a single correct methodology. His point of view is one of many equally valid points of view, and he is wrong to believe that himself and even more wrong to apply it to other people.
j307yo,I was thinking this too
j307yo,Which is fine, when it's me taking photos of a plant room installation, but...
j307yo,This is probably going to be a bit cruel, but you can suggest to him to post some of his best work on a photography subreddit to get more objective feedback. Let reddit be the bearer of bad news.
j307yo,I think this is an excellent idea. If it were me I'd approach it like this. Tell him that taking pictures for personal use is completely different than professional or artistic photography. Tell him that the photos you take and what you want from photos is clearly different. Then suggest he get tips and advice from people who share his passion. I'd just stop giving opinions because clearly you are seeing very different things and if he's otherwise a great partner hurting him over a hobby isn't a good move.
j307yo,This is perfect. Someone's gotta tell her BF that his photography isn't great and he needs to hear it from MULTIPLE people. Otherwise he'll turn into my uncle.Photography is undoubtedly my uncle's "thing" and he spends a lot of time on his amateur photography. He even has a dark room in his house where he develops his pictures. Which honestly makes it more awkward. He's extremely wealthy so it seems like he thought that because he invested so much in his hobby, it means he's good at it?He takes THE WORST pictures and is the worst ABOUT taking pictures. Always uses flash so our faces look super shiny, interrupts people by shoving the 1ft lens in their face at holidays and special events and then tells us to "act natural" for the candid shot (like, if you just took the picture without telling us to act natural... it would actually have been a candid photo??). If he isn't forcing us to act natural, he's making us pose or is just generally being annoying throughout events with his need to capture every moment.When both of my cousins got married, he forced them to find photographers who would send him all the raw unedited photos as well as the ones they had retouched so that he could "approve" them.For every holiday he gives out these tacky mugs and photo albums he gets printed at Staples with pictures from family events in the past year, but it's always his family though, never me or any of the other cousins, and if we're in his albums it's as part of the group photos. It's basically like he wants to gift everyone pictures of his adult children. It's extremely awkward lol.
j307yo,Leading him to reasonable criticism isn‚Äôt cruel, she‚Äôs not throwing him to the sharks or anything.Everyone at some point really needs a hard truth to shatter some distorted understanding they have about themselves/the world, otherwise laypersons walk about as if experts, only sowing discord with the real ones and are kept afloat by other laypeople and idiots.
j307yo,This is a good suggestion, with the caveat that one risk is that he will blame her for knowingly exposing him to criticism and making a fool out of himself. That said, the jolt of an outside opinion may be the only way to effectively dissuade him.
j307yo,I second this. The wisdom of crowds is a reliable guide for an artist.
j307yo,The number of people I'd like to recommend this to is.... high.
j307yo,It's not cruel, it's actually smart for a lot of reasons.The feedback is unbiased.Regardless of how harsh or constructive, it will help.OP doesn't have to be the bad guy
j307yo,People like him will make excuses for it... he will say everybody has bad taste or he just posted at the wrong time and another crowd on another date would probably like it. He will say everybody is wrong and he won‚Äôt stick around long enough to see that others consistently dislike his photos. But I‚Äôm jaded.
j307yo,Or OP could post a few of his photos..
hjy4me,Allow me to translate.What he says: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready for a relationship.‚ÄùWhat he means: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want a relationship; I just don‚Äôt want one with you. But please continue giving me sex and attention and stroking my ego until I find a replacement, during which time I‚Äôll dismiss your feelings of resentment and betrayal by reminding you that I explicitly stated that we weren‚Äôt dating. Sound good?‚Äù
hjy4me,YES!!! You will be strung along as long as you hang on to the rope he dangles.
hjy4me,To make OP feel better: OP although you have to take responsibility for the situation, it's not your fault. Your partner is lying to you. His actions send a message - that you are together. He thinks that because he's saying that he's not your boyfriend, that all his other actions should not be interpreted that way. But that's not an act of integrity.Call him out and tell him that to a woman in love, actions of love will speak louder than rarely said words. His actions communicate commitment. And if this is not how he truely feels, all of those actions are lies and he has used you.It's not your job to police his actions for integrity, and it's not your fault he lies to use people. That's on him. He can wave a magic wand and make you culpable - because that's what he does, very occasionally, with his words. And that's bullshit. A mature person wouldn't do that. He's perfectly capable of finding a woman who does not want commitment as well, and dating her.For the record, no matter what people tell you it's impossible to be open to love and on guard for shitty behavior all the time. You were open. He took advantage.We can't make women solely responsible for policing men's bad behavior in relationships.
hjy4me,Can confirm. If someone really likes you,  they'll commit. It's a case of 'He's just not that into you'. Dump and find someone who is.
hjy4me,Ooooof, I wish I'd read this comment 5 years ago instead of having to figure it out on my own.
hjy4me,I completely agree with this. The whole situation always reminds me of the saying, ‚Äúwhy go out and buy a whole cow if you‚Äôre getting milk from somewhere for free?‚Äù Basically why commit to a relationship if you‚Äôre getting the whole ‚Äúgirlfriend experience‚Äù with none of the commitment for free?Last time I was going through a pretty similar experience with a man a friend told me something that really helped me out. ‚ÄúIf I am not a FUCK yes to him then he is a FUCK NO to me.‚Äù It can be super mentally and emotionally draining to continually be a question mark to someone you absolutely adore. I suggest you sit down and think really, really hard about what you want, what you need and then the things in the middle that you‚Äôre willing to accept with this person as a trade off.
hjy4me,i‚Äôm in a very similar situation right now. thank you for putting this so clearly. i‚Äôve finally put my foot down because i‚Äôm tired of being used.
hjy4me,YEP. He's exploring his options, sleeping with other women, and making sure he stays available all while gets the benefits of a girlfriend but offers no commitment. He's a selfish child.
hjy4me,As someone who dealt with this shit 3 years post breakup with my ex and ‚Äúnever knowing‚Äù what he wants, listen to the advice above.A man will not let the woman he truly loves slip away. Even if there‚Äôs some genuine excuse as to why he‚Äôs not ready, he‚Äôs not emotionally available for you and you deserve much more than that.
hjy4me,Ding ding ding! This happened to me before. The guy wouldn't even call me his girlfriend at the year anniversary mark or after flying me across the country to meet his family (I paid for my ticket, not him). Turns out he had been pursuing someone else and as soon as she bit, he broke it off with me, but tried to get me to keep sleeping with him. It's funny though two days before we broke up he needed to "borrow" $400 to not be evicted. I never saw that money again.
hjy4me,Tru dat.  Dump his sorry ass.
hjy4me,Yep. This is a casual relationship. He is casual and you are the relationship. Get out quick, please.
hjy4me,He dumped the previous gf like a sack of hot potatoes...now he‚Äôs doing it to her. I smell a cycle!
hjy4me,I really don‚Äôt understand why girls ignore the obvious words he‚Äôs telling her. And says shes okay with just hooking up (which isn‚Äôt true) she clearly wants a relationship with the guy. In fact she‚Äôll take anything she can get. As women, we need to stop giving people discounts to out hearts and bodies. He‚Äôs entitled to not want a committed relationship but she needs to either accept that and be okay with not truly getting what she wants. Orrrrr go where it aligns to what she truly wants.
hjy4me,Yes it's hard to hear but important to hear, been there  and this is advice I should of listened to.
hjy4me,Yeah I didn‚Äôt have to read past the title to pick up on that one.Once dated a guy for a few weeks.  He was totally the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be committed‚Äù type.  Next thing he ghosts me and I figure out he met someone and moved in together.You‚Äôre just not the one he wants to commit to.
hjy4me,Yup. Even with a best intentions, a guy who starts a relationship with a 'not sure, it's probably not a good idea' either through selfish reasons or other causes, will never flip from 'not sure' to 100% commited. Never. Been there and gotten burned. The beginning of a relationship is when you're supposed to be inseparable and head over heals. It's the years that follow after when you hit a few rocks and rough patches along the way. If someone isn't ready to commit right at the beginning, they will drop you like a brick the moment the going gets tough even slightly.
hjy4me,Came here to say this exactly. OP, I‚Äôm so sorry you going through this. Believe me when I say that you are much, much better than this.
ls29y1,okay so, I have sort of a bit of experience coming from the same place as you and I kind of understand what you are going through. I even had to ask my friends if they thought the person I was dating was ugly or if it was just me (and it really was just me being a piece of sht)first of all, I think It would be really healthy to get off the social media for a while and kind of do a detox, that helped me out a lot because it literally gives you unrealistic standards and causes you to focus on the wrong things.the second thing that helped me a ton, was every time a thought that was negative about my partners appearance entered my mind, I would try to see the beauty in that moment as well.Humanity is not perfect, we are anything but that, and I think there is beautiful moments all the time. so take time to appreciate the imperfections, because it is beautiful, and it is what makes us unique. There is beauty in our flaws. the bags under her eyes in the mornings, or the way your tummies pooch out after you two eat a big meal or the way her face scrunches up when she laughs. these are tender wholesome moments and the fact that you can be this close and see this person, in their most raw form, vulnerable and intimate ...is so very refreshing outside of this fake perfect Instagram life we look at every day on the screen.so drink in the nectar of her reality and let it warm your heart. because each day is fleeting. and when you look back at these memories, you wouldn't want to remember a cold poised and always glamorous ideal. you want real, unadulterated love, flaws and all.thirdly try to ponder exactly what you consider "ugly" means to you? is ugly less than perfect? do you often judge yourself as well?at the end of the day beauty is subjective, and the standard of beauty is constantly evolving. I used to think unibrows were the most disturbing and ugly thing ever, then I met a girl who was actually quite beautiful and had a unibrow and, idk, after that they just weren't so bad any more LOL It kind of became an endearing thing rather than a total turn off. and the way she owned it was a whole mood lol.So do I think you can get better? yes, I do. with some perspective change, I think you will be able to enjoy this relationship even more than you do right now, all it takes is a little more focus on being  mindful and present in reality. working along with a therapist would also be a great start to get ahead.
ls29y1,This is was exactly the reply I hoped for. I will start to practice this straight away. Just reading your post and thinking of the things you suggested made me feel warm
ls29y1,That button is probably delete on Instagram etc.If you spend your time filling your brain with the idea the world is full of perfect looking women to choose from, you‚Äôll be disappointed with any real woman.Although if her face is appearing distorted to you, that may be a form of hallucination needed to be checked by your gp.
ls29y1,This is good advice.  Instagram is not real life and if it's making you think filters and makeup are an actual representation of what women should look like even when they're at home relaxing and earing chips, it has already gotten to you.
ls29y1,Sounds like you might have some narcissistic traits. You seem pretty self aware so I wouldnt say you're a narc but the way you talk about you're gf having more value to you when she looks the way you want sounds to me like quite a self centered view. Why does it matter so much to you if she doesnt always look her prettiest?
ls29y1,Good points, and I don't know. I think it's a form of insecurity. That I think every thing in life has to be improved upon at all times and nothing can just be as it is, and I also think this attitude is causing majority of my problems since it's not a good way to live
ls29y1,In truth here, I'd lay odds there are times when you look ugly to your GF as well: waking up in the morning, slack-jawed on your phone, eating something messy. I'm sure there are times your girlfriend isn't looking at you and thinking you look amazing. Please examine yourself with the same scrutiny as you do your girlfriend and appreciate that it is unrealistic and sexist to expect your girlfriend to look attractive in every moment. Do you hold yourself accountable to look hot in every resting moment? If not, why should she?Looking "ugly" is not a character flaw. You're not owed it to find your SO attractive every moment of the day. What IS a character flaw is this type of unrealistic expectation on your partner.I would encourage you to actively train yourself out of your shallowness by developing your appreciation for deeper things: her talents, strengths, sense of humor etc. This is a concerning trend as everyone gets less traditionally "attractive" with age, and we all age. This includes you.Therapy may also be helpful in assisting you to get over your experiences growing up and see others in a more realistic and caring light. Being "very shallow" is absolutely something that will cause problems in your life, and I am curious what steps you are taking to self reflect on this, either alone or with a professional.Does this shallowness and sexism affect other areas of your life? How is your attitude towards women in general? Do you judge men on their appearance this harshly, or just women? If so, why is that?Work on this before you age, have kids, or any other life event that will have natural effects to your girlfriend's external appearance.  Otherwise you will hurt this woman.
ls29y1,I strongly disagree on the sexist remark, but with that said I will say that I find your reply very useful, and the part "I would encourage you to actively train yourself out of your shallowness by developing your appreciation for deeper things: her talents, strengths, sense of humor etc. This is a concerning trend as everyone gets less traditionally "attractive" with age, and we all age. This includes you." is something I will start doing. This was the sort of thing I was hoping to get out of this post I just didn't have a blueprint for what I had to do
ls29y1,I also think that because I didn't get girlfriends before I sort of hyped it up that I needed to have the best girlfriend to justify all the years of wanting.You're not owed a girlfriend just because you didn't have one in the past. This is some in-cel thinking.I have tried to date a lot of girls based purely on apperance, and it never worked out.Because you did the same thing that was done to you and expected different results.But okay, I sometimes thinks my girlfriend is ugly. And it's in fleeting moments, then she looks like herself again.Because you've conditioned yourself to accept Instagram as reality, even if you try to rationalize that it's not. You may have become "hot", but you're still just as insecure on the inside and projecting it on your girlfriend. You have flashes of thinking YOU aren't good enough, and project it onto your girlfriend because it's easier to say that SHE is the "subpar" one than to accept that the fault lies with you. Your girlfriend isn't a doll that should be perfect 100% of the time for you just because you think you "deserve" it. She has her insecurities, just as you do.The bare minimum you should do right now is delete Instagram and any other app you use to look at women like this. You need to reframe your entire way of thinking to escape this, but you can only do it by stopping this self-victimization and not using "shallowness" as an excuse anymore.
ls29y1,Interesting response. What is in-cel thinking? I have never been invoulntary celebat because growing up I didn't think about sex. After 17 it was not an issue so don't follow on that one.self-victimization for thinking I have a problem?
ls29y1,This may sound a little pseudoscience-y but I truly believe that we project our own insecurities on others. For example - I‚Äôm hypercritical of everything I do, especially when it comes to my work. Because of this, I find myself hypercritical of other‚Äôs work. I look for flaws before I think about what went well. It‚Äôs engrained in me.I know you say you‚Äôve improved your looks, but maybe all that time scrutinizing yourself has warped your view of people, including your girlfriend.Do you view yourself as a complex individual with a full personality? Or do you see yourself as just a good looking dude who used to not be good looking? That answer might dictate how you see other people.
ls29y1,I think what you said is intereseting. I highly believe that I'm insecure and I am projecting. Maybe it goes without saying but what's the point of having a super attractive partner? mostly bragging rights I assume. The intapersonal connection can't be altered by the shape of the flesh of the person you are looking at...
ls29y1,I would strongly suggest counselling with a psychologist. This sounds like a deep seated issue with societal standards and you might benefit from therapy. It doesn't sound healthy at all, especially since it sounds like you may be hallucinating at times. You might even need to see a psychiatrist.
ls29y1,I will take it to heart. I don't think I'm hallucinating. I think I fixate and magnify.
ls29y1,Break up with her, please! If that‚Äôs all you care about then let her find someone else better. Imagine your girlfriend reading this.
ls29y1,I understand this reply from your point of view. I have highlighted the worst part of me that I internally experience a few seconds at a time. You don't know us, you only know this and if I would break up then I would have destroyed her life.But I want to talk to somebody about this, based on your reply it sounds to me like you think being shallow is not a characther defect? Like I should just go back to dating girls based on apperances after at least 5 girlfriends where I ended up leaving because it didn't work out.I know a counter argument to this is that I should find somebody that I find beautiful and that it works with, but as I hope my post conveys, that's what i feel about my girlfriend 99% of the time
ls29y1,Stop looking at instagram models. Get therapy.
ls29y1,I think that some of the therapeutic techniques people use to overcome their own negative appearance-related self-talk can be useful to your thoughts about your girlfriend, since you recognize that the problem lies within you rather than her. Every time you catch yourself focusing on a physical flaw she has, you need to replace/counter that thought with finding a little detail about her that you think is beautiful. Since you seem to generally find her attractive enough, this shouldn't be too difficult. Try and come up with new details that you haven't noticed before every time if you can.
ls29y1,This is very good advice, this sounds very worthwhile and I will do this
kbbm3l,I remember your last post, don't wait on it. The brain is good at telling yourself you can just 'fix it alone' but that's a lie and denial speaking. No one can do it alone and there's no shame in getting therapy.
kbbm3l,Are you going to see a regular trauma therapist like a bunch of us told you to do in your first post?If so, look for someone who specializes in Cognitive Processing Therapy. It's specifically designed for PTSD and it saved my ass after my near-death experience.
kbbm3l,Thank you for the suggestion
kbbm3l,Lol, yeah, that is a "nope."
kbbm3l,Trauma bonding is an incredibly strong emotional experience where you‚Äôre basically desperately searching for someone that you can connect with on that level. It can also be very toxic and I can tell you don‚Äôt want to be involved. Get help, you deserve it and you‚Äôre not weak or anything for seeking help and admitting injury or trauma. All of this is very human.
kbbm3l,Yes, it's important to get some distance and therapy. Your seeking relationships and intimacy might come from trauma and you don't want to mistake transference for genuine attraction.
kbbm3l,That's a really helpful way of framing it :)
kbbm3l,New tools for the mental toolbox
kbbm3l,Especially when in reality, sure maybe you could do all of those things without an expert, but you don't. Unreached potential is completely worthless if you don't seek out assistance in attaining that unreached potential.I can eat well and exercise regularly and save money and work incredibly hard and go to sleep early and volunteer and plan ahead and dozens of other high-value high-reward daily behaviors. In reality, if I manage do to more than a few of those kinds of things in a day, that was an incredibly successful day. Because knowledge of how to do something and theoretical potential does not in any meaningful way translate directly into action.
kbbm3l,Your mind isn‚Äôt broken. You experienced a terrible trauma, and your brain created new feelings to help you survive. That‚Äôs not broken. The new emotions don‚Äôt work for you outside the trauma experience, but with professional individual help, you can learn to reprocess yet again.I might suggest a male therapist, at least to start with.Good luck! This is workable.
kbbm3l,This is all good, but you should say it's an obsession. Maybe a very minor one, but an obsession. Go to individual therapy and tell them everything. I went to read your first post and you seem like at least you can see something went wrong. That's a great first step, but you're not broken. Your brain is trying to overcome this trauma on it's own without help. It happens to a lot of people who go through trauma. When you see a therapist they can help guide you on how to heal and eventually each day will get better. I'm sorry and I hope the best for you.
kbbm3l,Yes, he's in an emotionally vulnerable spot and is therefore vulnerable to thoughts that the objects of his attention can fill those needs.
kbbm3l,Please seek professional help now, rather than waiting for your wife to find out and then dumping your butt.  I think the devastation and pain you will see crossing her face will traumatize you into manning up and admitting that you need professional help and then getting it. Cause obviously you trying to be your own therapist very clearly isn't working.
kbbm3l,The fact that this has happened a second time I think is proof - which I do believe you recognise - that this is not a healthy innocent crush. What I don't believe you recognise is just how serious this is. I remember your last post, you said you don't have PTSD. I think this stems from the media portrayal of one type of typical combat PTSD and not much else. I can assure you that you're showing very clear signs of complex PTSD and I urge you to seek help immediately. Since your attraction seems to be to women, I highly recommend you seek out a male therapist to work with.I wish you only the best.
kbbm3l,It's been 24 days. You need to get help for this NOW and not in another 24 days
kbbm3l,Do not go to a woman therapist.
kbbm3l,PTSD manifests in many ways... definitely go get some one-on-one therapy. You deserve the help.
kbbm3l,This is all a PTSD coping mechanism. See a therapist.
kbbm3l,Please listen and stop attending group therapy, it is only sabotaging your recovery and your marriage. I also would like to point out that although you are very ill and obviously are struggling with PTSD, that it is creepy and disrespectful to be obsessing over someone who came for help end support like you. Think about how your behavior could potentially can make a woman who is already a survivor of PTSD, feel unsafe in what‚Äôs supposed to be a safe space.
kbbm3l,I was just thinking of what it could turn into for another participant to become obsessed with the other and cross boundaries like that. No bueno; it's potentially re traumatising and putting someone else's recovery at risk.
kbbm3l,I feel like you are truly not understanding what is  and has happened to you.During the circumstances that proceeded the crash your brain was suddenly  (probably for the very first time in your life) thrown into a super hypersensitive mode of awareness and analysis and survival.For the common person this almost never happens in their lifetime. During this time literally every sense amd emotion you have is suddenly awakened to a primal level that is legitimately unexplainable to the average person.This in and of itself is an incredibly addictive experience that no amount of thrill seeking or risky behavior can ever possibly replicate. In short,  you have had a primal fight or flight awakening of your caveman DNA.In the immediate aftermath of this you suddenly find yourself surrounded by death and wounded.The adrenaline that was dumped into your bloodstream during the crash created a high that so amount of drugs can ever possibly simulate. What usually happens right after this adrenaline high wears off is that the person will experience a wide range of emotions that generally include depression or anxiety. That's a normal reaction.What happened in your case is that while that high was wearing off you became a legitimate life saver for one of the fellow passengers by rendering the appropriate aid in the right time.All if these things while incredibly rare and unusual are totally normal reactions to completely abnormal events. But here is where it gets tricky.An adrenaline high is the most addictive experience in  the world.I feel like subconsciously you are seeking that high in ways that are unknown for you. You are latching on to the idea of things that you know are risky and potentially dangerous to the "normal " life you knew before.What I am tell you (not asking) is that you need to seek professional one on one counseling right now before everything you have ever known and loved is gone from your life.
j7dqzd,Definitely bring it up in therapy and see if they have techniques.I also sometimes would do this in a playful way (was not in an abusive household), but was motivated to stop because I don‚Äôt think hitting is okay, even in jest/if it isn‚Äôt hard. It definitely isn‚Äôt something I want my kids to mimic. What helped me stop was literally becoming cognitively aware that I was doing it and doing something else physical to express the teasing/joking. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done it for like a decade now. If my husband is being cheeky/teasing me or something, I do a loving arm squeeze or rub to accompany my laughter instead of a playful hit, which he loves because he‚Äôs a physical touch person and feels ‚Äúseen‚Äù with physical expression from me.Maybe see if you can put the energy into a positive expression instead of a negative one. It‚Äôll take some time, but you may be able to make the positive expression become second nature.
j7dqzd,I love this advice since clearly OP isn't being malicious and means it endearingly. We don't know the partner, but I know if my partner grabbed my arm sweetly while joking around I'd find the gesture sweet and endearing
j7dqzd,Different but i‚Äôm impulsive and develop habits like this that i‚Äôm not aware of or, in the moment, in control of. For example, i curse a lot. I used to curse at work too, until the issue was brought up to me (when i was younger) and even though i couldn‚Äôt stop myself from cursing, after each time that i said a curse word i would correct myself by saying a g rated version of it. It only took a few weeks before i started saying the g rated words instead of the bad ones. So even if op finds herself hitting reflexively, she could do a loving squeeze or rub after, in order to rewire her reactions.
j7dqzd,Amazing response and advice.
j7dqzd,I have a very similar experience! When I first started dating my boyfriend, if he was teasing me or winding me up for fun, I would playfully jab him. Turns out from his end it wasn't so playful, and he really didn't like it. I felt AWFUL when he told me, but three years later I've worked on actively not doing it, and it's not a problem anymore. I think it was the same for me, just actively noticing I was doing it was enough to remind me to stop. Doing an arm squeeze instead is a really good idea.For why I did it in the first place, I'm not too sure? I think it might have had something to do with growing up with a twin, we used to play fight/ end up actual fighting when we were younger. It was pretty normal behavior I think, definitely nothing abusive, but I wonder if because we were the same age there was no immediate "wrong doing" from either of us, just more like "both of you stop that".In general reading this post and this comment has made me feel incredibly relieved, because I honestly felt like the worst person on earth for having done this to my boyfriend in the first place.
j7dqzd,This was me too. I switched to light poking. Now I just poke occasionally, shoulder or nose typically with my SO.
j7dqzd,I used to be this person too when I was around your age. I became aware of the behavior when someone took it really badly (obviously - I'd just hit them. I was in the wrong.)For a while I would still hit people playfully, but would catch myself and apologize.After a while, I hit people less and less. Now I can't remember the last time I did that to another person. It's no longer reflexive.You can change your behavior. It just takes time and practice and accountability.
j7dqzd,This was me too! It's crazy how common this seems to be, I never would have suspected that. The good news OP, is it is definitely possible to change this bad behavior!
j7dqzd,Hi! I used to do the same through all my childhood, adolescense and early adulthood. I never realised it, to me it was a common thing my mom did to me and my brother and so I did it to everyone around me. It happenned mainly when I felt frustrated or a little angry.One day I did it to an ex and he turned around and straight up told me 'Hey, why did you hit me! I don't like that, please stop'. I remember that moment to this day and from there I was conscious when I was about to do it, I kept thinking why doing it felt so normal and so whenever I felt like hitting I stopped myself.After forbiding me to give hits ir pats, all the of the them dissapeared because I got accostumed to not give them. I know it sound silly but once you know what you actually feel and think you can also control what you do.So, I recommend you to talk with a therapist, ask yourself why you do it, you know like finding the root, make it concious and if you don't like to hit people then stop everytime you feel the impulse. With time you'll simply stop doing it. Oh, and tell other people (your family for example) to not hit you.Hope all this can help you.
j7dqzd,I used to "punch" friends out of excitement at movie theatres or when hanging out... idk why i did exactly but after one said it did kinda hurt I kinda morphed the gesture into slapping my thighs and now I've mostly stopped. Redirecting the guesture could be easier while you work on stopping it, just, you know, don't hurt yourself!
j7dqzd,Hi, I'm not sure if this will help but my ex had a similar issue, everytime I said something she didnt like she tap me with back of her hand like I was a misbehaving dog. I did not like it, so I sat down and explained how it made me feel. She cried, apologised and made a really big effort to stop.I'm not sure if she used any specific techniques, but hearing her be so upset at her own behaviour and making a really obvious effort to deal with it made me feel very valued.
j7dqzd,I went through something similar. When my husband and I were dating, I realized that I was smacking him, flicking my fingers against him a lot. I came from a less than perfect home as well, and I think I just wasn‚Äôt taught that you can caress people in a non-sexual, casual way.What I really wanted was to touch him, and I certainly wasn‚Äôt hurting him, but it took that lightbulb moment for me to recognize it still wasn‚Äôt okay and he deserved better.I think your realization will probably take care of the problem, but if you do reach out without realizing, stop and genuinely apologize and tell him you are working on it.You‚Äôve got this, and it‚Äôs wonderful that you are thinking and talking about it.
j7dqzd,So many girls do this when they laugh or get excited because they are not conditioned to think they can hurt men physically. I‚Äôd say just be aware of it for a month or so and you‚Äôll break the habit
j7dqzd,Trying being more conscious about it when your with him. Think "I'll resist hitting". You'll fail but eventually you'll realize you're about to do it and stop.
j7dqzd,This is a relatively common problem.  There are a lot of people that do this, especially women, as a means of affection and/or frustration.  It is often an unconscious act.  Definitely talk to your therapist about it though and get guidance on were to go from here.Likely one recommendation may be to try and use a different form of physical affection, like touching his arm or shoulder instead of hitting him.  This will require you to pay more attention to what you are doing.  Even if you find yourself hitting him before you can stop yourself, follow it up by touching his arm or shoulder (or some other gesture that he may feel is more appropriate).  This way you will start reconditioning yourself to use a different gesture for this.If it is a result of frustration, usually the suggestion is to talk about problems more frequently before they get pent up and you feel the need for that physical release.  Or same as above, find another avenue to vent, like exercise.This behavior has also been propogated by entertainment.  Lots of shows use to show this behavior as normal and cute.  Likely most guys would find it relatively harmless, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is the best thing.  It can send mixed messages about what is acceptable in a relationship.
j7dqzd,i‚Äôm a young, smallish female and i used to find myself being a little too pushy/aggressive w playing with my SO‚Äôs. i realized it was because i had been in physically abusive relationships and i subconsciously wanted my new partner to know i wasn‚Äôt weak and soft, and that if i had to, i could physically fight back or protect myself even though they didn‚Äôt physically make me feel threatened at all. it only happened when i drank. and one day i hip-bumped my partner while playing beer pong a little too hard and he kind of snapped and was like ‚ÄúWHAT is that all about?? why are you being so pushy‚Äù and i was super embarrassed bc i had NO idea and never realized. the more i thought about it i was able to catch myself in the moment and say. is this behavior necessary or helpful? no.
j7dqzd,My suggestion, seeing this as a habit to break: Come up with a codeword, like "banana." Ask that he say the codeword if you start to hit him. When he says "banana," stop what you're doing. Hopefully over time your brain will stop you BEFORE you actually hit him, and then you'll get out of the habit and lose the impulse to hit him.
j7dqzd,Yup. I grew up abused by my sister but my parents normalized it and treated it like it was normal so I hit people a lot. I didn't think it was bad. Then I started seeing a guy and hit him in the arm once, he looked at me and very calmly but seriously said "don't hit me." I immediately went into mentally rationalizing that it was actually okay but it struck a cord in me that nothing ever had before. I too told myself at first it was an involuntary thing and I'd done it too long and couldn't change. But then I made the choice to not do it again and we dated for almost 5 years and not only did I never hit him again, I never hit anyone again. Sometimes changing the way you mentally perceive your own actions can make a huge difference.
j7dqzd,Consciously think about it and stop yourself. When do you feel you want to hit him? When you are in that scenario, consciously remind yourself to not hit him and resist that urge to do so. It sounds like hitting is an unconscious thing, and it'll take a conscious effort to change it. It's going to feel weird and your muscles may feel 'jumpy' as you're going to want to do it, but restrain yourself consistently
n95hkj,Stop talking to his gf. You already know from his family that her account of things isn't entirely accurate. I would talk to him about what she said and your concerns.
n95hkj,OP, I understand that you feel very uncomfortable and guilty. I also understand that your husband's ex girlfriend (because that's what she is) has feelings for him and is trying to make their relationship work. However, nowhere in your post does it indicate that your husband is interested in being with his ex. So, rather than continuing to punish yourself for the past, for your choices, for all the what ifs and maybes, why don't you just talk with your husband? Explain what his ex has told you and how you feel. Let it all out because as it stands you're still trying to punish yourself for past actions. Also, it's not on you to decide who your husband should be with - it's on him.Please, if you can, get therapy, but even if you don't, please learn to be kind to yourself. You matter. And, please for the love of God, stop talking to your husband's ex. She isn't looking out for you or your husband, she's looking out for herself, and it's about time for you to look out for yourself too.
n95hkj,She sounds obsessed not like a woman deeply in love and that's just from a few sentences in the post... OP try some couple counseling and use that time to decide what you want to do and what you believe.
n95hkj,Also, OP. Stop making decisions for him. If he wanted to be with her instead he'd be with her.
n95hkj,Op if you want to make this work you need to learn to communicate with him. You locked yourself up before and it didn't work for the relationship. Don't do it again! Also, why call her his gf when they are broken up??I found that therapy helped me.
n95hkj,Work it out with him. This other woman is his mess to clean up.
n95hkj,Yeah. OP, block her. If your husband wants to work thing out with you, then HE needs to close that chapter in his life for good and make sure she knows it is permanently over or else you are going to have her hanging over you guys like a black cloud.Your husband is in a messy, sticky situation because he slept with a crazy person. Now he needs to deal with it.
n95hkj,Don't work it out with either of them, honestly. The husband has been using this woman for sex and isn't even strong or humane enough to end it.
n95hkj,This is therapy material. Are you seeing a therapist?  If not, make this a priority.  Everything else here is trivial compared to that.  Get a strong base of emotional health and then you and your husband can consider reconciling.I would not talk to his ex girlfriend again.  Nothing good comes from it.
n95hkj,Have you had any therapy since your miscarriage? Look the relationship, should you choose to restart it would be between you and your separated husband. FWB is in her place as FWB and she‚Äôs trying to psych you out. Make the decision on your own. Let it be clear to husband that if you‚Äôre willing to try- because it seems you want to- this woman has to be firmly in the rearview mirror. If he wanted to be with her permanently he would have done so in the three years y‚Äôall have been apart. You are parroting her words and giving them more weight than what he‚Äôs told you- why is that? Why do you care for someone he‚Äôs unwilling to commit to who‚Äôs begging you to step aside so she could maybe have him. Normally with another woman situation I‚Äôd say walk away, but he left because you asked and he hasn‚Äôt tried to make it permanent- if this is someone you can see in your life again- go for it. Also stop giving this woman space in your brain.
n95hkj,Have you had any therapy since your miscarriage?Yes, I've been going for about 2 years.I think I'm giving her words so much weight because I really don't want to hurt another person ever again. I still feel terrible for how I treated my husband, I know I hurt him badly and the thought of doing that to another person again makes me feel physically ill.
n95hkj,If he really wants to get back together and knows he does not have a future with this woman, he should be ending things with this woman regardless of whether you are an option or not.It's very clear at this point that even if he sees this as a FWB, she has feelings and has involved him in her life and her child's life. He had to know that was happening, especially if he has tried to end things several times.  If he does not want a future with her he is the one hurting her by not ending it and either she's totally making stuff up, he has deliberately lied to you about his level of involvement, or he has acted really irresponsibly himself (meeting a FWBs children and bringing a FWB he never intended to get serious with around family while still married to someone else).He needs to be able to break-up with her and have it stick. He needs to do that regardless of whether he ends up working things out with you or not unless what he is telling you is false and he really does see a future with her. He needs to be clear with her that you are not the reason he is ending things and that he is ending things because he never viewed their relationship as serious. Pretending you are the "dark cloud" is unfair to you and puts you in a precarious position. It's ethically irresponsible (cruel really) to carry on a casual sex-based relationship with someone you know is deeply in love with you. He should be very clear with her that he is ending things with her whether or not the two of you reconcile.If he really has been doing that or continues to do that until you make-up your mind, it may be time to consider whether your husband actually shares your values. You are so worried about hurting others you are hesitant to move forward in your marriage for fear of the impact on the other woman. He has no problem using someone who clearly has feelings for him for sex. This might actually be an indicator of greater incompatibilities between the two of you that shouldn't really be ignored.Whatever else happens, you also need to stop talking to her. Tell her you can't speak for him and you aren't the one controlling who he decides he wants to be with. Tell him you are not currently with him. Be clear that you do not want her to contact you again. Put that in writing (because she sounds unhinged). Then block. If she contacts you again be ready to take the appropriate legal routes available to you where you live.Then tell him that regardless of what happens with you, he needs to disentangle himself  from this relationship with her before you even consider whether you want to work on reconciliation or not.  Either he is deliberately misleading both of you (in other words he's said things to her and/or you about their relationship status that has led to this point) or she is mentally unstable in pretty obvious ways that he has decided to ignore to continue to fuck her without consideration for how that impacts her, her child, or you. Either way, his behavior with her is problematic.  So make sure you don't fail to ignore this for the red flag regarding him that it is.Once he has completely separated from her and taking steps to ensure she isn't going to try to do things that might be harmful to you, your family, his family, your marriage, etc. Then consider what the two of you need to do to repair your marriage.If he really wants to be with you he won't have a problem ending things with her and waiting for you to get your bearings here.Take things slowly and be deliberate in reconciling.  While he is the man you have known since childhood and were with for many years, he's also been the man who has dated (however casually or seriously) someone else for years and has involved himself in her child's life either knowing that he was not committed or because he initially intended to commit and is now deceiving you about that. You're going to want to get to know him again as he is now before deciding what your next steps are here. You're definitely going to want to spend time getting to know him before deciding to commit again. At the very least he's been entangled in an unhealthy relationship recently and/or made some questionable choices. He's your husband, sure, but he is also someone immediately disengaging from a pretty toxic relationship with someone who clearly has poor boundaries. Their relationship isn't perfect. He's married to someone else, they've broken up multiple times, he's either lying to her or it isn't a relationship at all, etc. You aren't destroying anything wonderful by getting back together with him, but you may be getting back together with someone who has developed some really unhealthy relationship behaviors.That isn't someone you would jump into a marriage with (someone who is just getting out of a relationship with someone unstable in which he was committed enough to be involved in her child's life) , so don't jump right back into being a married couple. Just get to know each other again and start there.BUT it starts with him permanently ending things with her. Regardless of what happens or does not happen with your marriage or divorce.If he tells you he can't end things with her until he knows where he stands with you, that tells you a hell of a lot about whether you ought to pursue things with him or whether he is being honest with you right now about his feelings, the nature of his relationship with her, etc. If she's truly just a casual sex partner/ FWBs, he can end it in one phone call and be done. If there are reasons he can't (it's too hard, she's unstable, etc.) that tells you he isn't ready to disentangle and still has some sort of connection to her that needs to be severed before he is available to do the deep repair work your marriage will need.
n95hkj,This is completely the correct answer.The fact that the husband became involved in the woman's child's life makes me think he knows exactly what he was doing and that the woman is telling (at least some part of) the truth.
n95hkj,You are not the other woman.The gf is not respecting your ex‚Äôs boundaries.  He has made it clear that he only wants to be a friends with benefits.  She refuses to accept this.Your ex should not be forced to say in a relationship with gf if he is not happy.  There‚Äôs a reason why they keep breaking up, and I bet they mainly get back together based on her use of guilt and manipulation.  He is allowed to date and be with the person he wants.The gf‚Äôs child is not your ex‚Äôs responsibility.  The gf should have been honest with her child about their relationship.The gf is selfish and cares more about what she wants over anything else‚Äôs needs.  She doesn‚Äôt care if the ex would be happier with you.It‚Äôs ok to get back together with your ex as long as he makes a clean break from the gf first and you both do individual and couple‚Äôs counseling.  You will both most likely need to block the gf.  She will continue to try to guilt and manipulate you.  This just shows how entitled and selfish she is.
n95hkj,Why are you talking to the ex girlfriend? This woman is not going to say anything remotely genuine.  He broke it off and she is not taking it well. This is his issue to deal with firmly. As far as you and your husband are concerned, if he is reaching out and you want him back then work on that together. Go to couples therapy.  There seems to be love there still in each side. I hope the two of you find a way back to each other.
n95hkj,The girlfriend is not part of the people you should be discussing things with. He loves you, and you still love him, so you need to discuss this with him.Remember what it was before all the pain you went through, and what it can be again. You lost part of yourself you will never regain, but do think of what you're denying each other if you don't try. You may have lost that chance 3 years ago, but your future can be extremely happy.Regarding the pain you don't want to inflict on him, I'd say go to therapy together to work this out. It'd be foolish to let go of the person you love, that loves you as well.I hope you work it out, op ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä
lbqsli,If I were in your shoes, I would no longer be around them. I wouldn't allow them to visit anymore and I wouldn't visit them. He can go alone  You can't force your husband to do anything and apparently he won't be convinced by what is right in front of his face.If your husband invites them for a visit anyway, just leave. Go stay somewhere else. Take your daughter too. Stay with a friend, a relative, a hotel, some combination. If your husband wants to spend time with and coddle his insane parents he can do it by himself. You don't have to tolerate them berating you nor do you have to tolerate being gaslighted by your husband.He was raised by these people so has probably been conditioned to think this behavior is normal and acceptable. He needs therapy to recognize it and draw healthy boundaries. Until he can do that you don't have to tolerate that crap.
lbqsli,I agree that you should be absent, with your daughter, from this weird and extreme behavior. If your husband can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt adjust his reaction to his parents, you do not have to endure them in person.Perhaps use these weeks to stay in a friend‚Äôs home, or rent a hotel room. Your MIL can cook and clean and play like your son is little again. Your FIL can pout and fume pick fights and and be center of attention...but you won‚Äôt see any of it.Perhaps your husband will snap out of it when the hotel bills come to his attention, or when he gradually sees the unhealthy behaviors of his parents. And will they miss their granddaughter when you remove her during their visits? I don‚Äôt know what their reaction will be to any of this, but your husband should be on YOUR team, not theirs.Couples therapy is required here.
lbqsli,No, don‚Äôt leave the house in their hands. After a month you will not recognise it. Remember they don‚Äôt agree with the placement of things. They will demolish it.
lbqsli,Agreed. If they're insulting you in front of your daughter, go to a friend's or your family for the month they're there. Teach people how to treat you. Set up some good boundaries and stick with them.
lbqsli,I agree that I think the only way for OP to get any traction on the issue is to leave when they are around. Husband has made it clear he isn‚Äôt willing or able to see what‚Äôs actually happening and how things are from OPs perspective. If I were in her shoes I might have one final conversation where I lay it out on the table and make clear what my conditions are before going with the leaving-when-they-come-over option but if the conversation isn‚Äôt productive I‚Äôd just go ahead and make the plans to be out of the house when they‚Äôre there. Maybe OP and her daughter can get a monthly air b&b or stay with relatives/a friend or some sort of short term rental that might save them some money. There are also long term hotels with kitchenettes but they do get expensive. But husband isn‚Äôt going to take OP seriously unless she takes a hard line, and I‚Äôm assuming she wants to stay married so other than divorce, leaving is really all she‚Äôs got. Edit- Of course if she can swing it, I think putting her foot down on them even coming over to visit is a better idea.
lbqsli,Her description of them reminds me of 90 Day Fianc√©‚Äôs Brandon and his parents. Worst parents ever. Completely toxic, self righteous, clingy, and controlling.
lbqsli,I think it's beyond past time for some ultimatums and boundaries for you. Like, "If you want to stay married to me, then you have to come to couples counseling with a licensed therapist with me." And, "Our bedroom is our bedroom. Your parents will sleep in the guest bedroom [or on a pull-out couch, or in a hotel nearby, or whatever]." And, "This month-long takeover of our home is over. No guests for longer than a week."And honestly, that needs to be just the beginning of the boundaries that you set. There's a whole lot of crossing lines they've been doing, without any pushback from their son - and that has to stop. The primary leverage that you have is that your husband still wants to be married to you. But you've got to have backbone and let him know that you aren't going to go on being married to him under these conditions.
lbqsli,Totally agree with you here. Therapy has to be completely non-negotiable. The only way anything will change is if he sees this from an outside perspective. Also, it isn't his parents ruining the marriage, the husband is doing that all by himself. There should have been boundaries set by him many years ago and if he doesn't now after her laying it out on the table, then that's 100% on him.
lbqsli,But you've got to have backbone and let him know that you aren't going to go on being married to him under these conditions....and to follow through if he's not willing to change anything. Because while not inevitable, that's a distinct possibility.
lbqsli,All this.  Firm boundaries, discussed firmly.  "I'm now married.  I want to spend my life with my wife, not you".  Honestly it wasn't until i pushed back firmly on my mother did I see the crap she was pulling.  Not nearly this bad, but it was crap nonetheless.
lbqsli,Thank you for the perspective
lbqsli,I completely agree. The parents are abusive and manipulative and it sounds like, despite his protests, the husband is their trained monkey. This is a scenario in which OP can't win  unless she sets those boundaries and enforces them.
lbqsli,Two cards. A therapist and a divorce lawyer. Tell him to select one.
lbqsli,Get some security cameras and records their nonsense. They are crazy.
lbqsli,You are not wrong, the issue is that your husband is deep in the fog. Have you pointed out to him that this is not normal nor healthy?Maybe suggest couples therapy? Get him talking with an independent person who can echo you (and the truth)
lbqsli,Thank you. I have pointed him that it is not healthy, but he doesn't want to talk to them cos of some misplaced honor.
lbqsli,God this hit hard
lbqsli,This. Absolutely this. And since he refuses to get counseling and try to fix the problem, I would honestly leave. His parents are narcissists, and I KNOW it's hard to get out of that fog. But if he isn't willing to work to set boundaries and save your marriage and family, then why stay? His parents are terrible people that revel in making you absolutely miserable. They'll do it to your kid, too. You don't have to spend your life being treated like shit, gaslighted, and disrespected in your own home.  You and your kid deserve better.
lbqsli,the problem is your husband...INFO, when you were dating, and you met his parents, were they that crazy then? was your husband such an enabling doormat? if so, you failed to notice those red flags, you have to talk to your husband, IMO....
nq57lw,Wouldn't really care.Also, idk the kind of relationship you have with your friends, but the few I met up with during this quarantine stuff (my city is still on lockdown so I have barely seen my friends in last year but at least I live with my bf), I literally told them "hey, I gained some weight over the year which I feel terrible/self-concious about, so just be prepared" lol None of them care and they had all gained a bit of weight as well. I gained a lot more though. About 50lbs üôÉ been working on losing it, though. Don't really want to go back to work like this, but I am okay if my friends see as real friends don't give a f.
nq57lw,I recently met up with friends for the first time since the plague hit and we all gained weight. We're all just so tired and depressed, no wonder!
nq57lw,It's so reassuring to hear that your friends didn't care, and I will give my friends a heads up before. Thank you for your response and best of luck with your weight loss journey!
nq57lw,I think continuing to isolate yourself will contribute negatively to your mental health which will contribute negatively to your weight loss journey (if thats a thing you want to do).I would be honest with those two friends who reached out. Let them know how much you miss and appreciate them but that you've been embarrassed bc you've put on so much weight. Tell them that you'd like to meet up but that you'd prefer not to discuss your weight/body (unless you do want their advice or something but idk how helpful it'd be unless they've experienced a similar situation). If they are decent friends, they will be understanding.You're worth love and respect whether you've put on weight or not. I think its great if you want to focus more on your health but mental health is a critical part of this and you need to take care of yourself in a rounded way, social interaction and having a strong support system can be crucial for ppl to make progress.I guess my question is when you guys meet someone you haven‚Äôt seen in a year and they look much bigger, what do you think? Would it change your perspective of them? Would you lose respect for them etc?This has happened more than once and I literally didnt really notice. Maybe Im self-absorbed but i really think it has to do more with not caring what they look like. My friends arent my friends bc i want to collect friend trophies i can display on a shelf. They're my friends bc we get along, are there for each other and enjoy one another's company. I think it may also be beneficial to think about ways you would like your friends to support you. I never know what to say to friends who bring up weight struggles bc i love them whatever their size but ik its something they dont feel good about. If your friends havent experienced it for themselves, they may need your guidance on best they can support you.
nq57lw,Thank you so much for your kind reply - it honestly made me tear up. I am definitely feeling encouraged to just be honest and let them know how I feel and give them a heads up and I agree that seeing them will hopefully help my mental health.
nq57lw,My BFF and I have been friends for almost 40 years. We've seen each other in all sorts of physical and mental conditions.I love her no matter her size, and she feels the same.Go see your friends. Life is short.
nq57lw,I long for a friendship like this, and life is short indeed. I‚Äôm feeling more confident now to see them, thanks for your reply.
nq57lw,Great comment. I'm in exactly the same situation, my BF was someone I met in my early 20s, now I'm in my 60s. I was huge at one point, she was super-slender. Now she's large and I'm smaller than her, but it means nothing to us and never has.An enduring lifelong friendship is a beautiful thing.
nq57lw,I love my friends, it's not conditional. They are beautiful people because of their heart.
nq57lw,I feel the same way - thank you for your reassuring comment.
nq57lw,If I was your friend, I would be more worried about the fact that you isolated yourself for a year, you know? A real friend would never think less of you about your weight, but if you just dropped off the face of the planet and never spoke to them, I would frankly think you were just a bad friend.Just talk to them about it first, be honest and say you‚Äôve been struggling with your body image and mental health and you would like to see them again, but you‚Äôre struggling with it. Tell them what you posted here, and if they don‚Äôt take it well, they were never your friend to begin with.Are you in therapy? I think it‚Äôs something you should really consider.
nq57lw,That's true, I think I have just accepted that I was gonna be the bad friend who disappeared but haven't considered that they might be concerned about how I handled the situation overall. I have recently started therapy actually because the loneliness and shame were really getting to me. Thank you for your reply.
nq57lw,I was you in this situation, but I was up 60. My stomach was in knots and i cried before I joined them. You know what? They were so supportive when I confessed I was scared to show them my weight gain. Most of them gained some, too. I‚Äôm almost 10 pounds down and my friends are my biggest cheerleaders.
nq57lw,I'm so happy for you! I can definitely see myself crying right before but your response gave me so much hope. Thanks for your reply.
nq57lw,A lot of people have put weight on during quarantine. I actually had a similar situation this weekend (in reverse), where I saw a friend I haven‚Äôt seen at all this year and she‚Äôd put on so much weight I didn‚Äôt recognise her for a moment. Was I surprised? Yeah kinda. Did I judge her? Absolutely not. I knew she‚Äôs had a really difficult year and it explained a lot about why she‚Äôd been avoiding everyone. It didn‚Äôt affect our interaction at all and honestly, she seems like she‚Äôs got kinda nicer since she put on weight (used to be a massive workout freak and pretty judgemental herself). My advice would be, if you‚Äôre self conscious about it, give people the heads up just so you don‚Äôt get any involuntary double takes. But of course your friends aren‚Äôt going to be catty about it or feel superior to you, unless they‚Äôre horrible people in which case it‚Äôs better to find that out now before wasting any more time on them. People have got more open and compassionate during the pandemic in so many ways. Tell them you‚Äôre struggling with your body image right now and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll rally around you.
nq57lw,Thank you so much for your reply. Definitely can't blame them if they get surprised haha! It would feel so great to have them not judge or treat me differently. I am now planning to give them a heads up and see what happens.
nq57lw,I agree with everyone that says true friends won't shame you, but anxiety isn't always rational. What if you found an excuse to send a selfie? Would it make you feel less anxious to get the "surprise" over with?
nq57lw,That's a great idea. I am thinking of sending them a picture, and perhaps sending a pic beforehand. Thanks for your reply.
nq57lw,The way I like to approach things like this is, to put yourself in your friends shoes.Would you judge one of your friends negatively for gaining weight?If the answer is 'no', then you should expect your friends to have similar values to you.If the answer is 'yes' , then ask yourself why and go down that hole. You'll learn a lot about yourself and the values you hold and help frame it better in terms of what your expectations are from people and in turn yourself.
nq57lw,I like your approach. I have seen some acquaintances gain weight in the past, and it was just a passing thought of what they were going through but don't remember thinking negatively of them. However, I still get anxious because my friends might have different reactions than I do.. I guess there's only one way to find out! Thanks for your reply.
l6j61b,Reading this felt both sad and educational somehow, I almost forgot this was a post. The way it's written is a great balance of self awareness. Truthfully, we don't need a partner to be happy in life, however you need the experience to know that you don't really need it.The fact that you've made a life for yourself and took care of/developed yourself in spite of the feelings of depression is the real achievement. Being in medicine is already a very depressing industry, lack of the dating life that you wanted would be the nail in the coffin for many.I can only offer the virtual hug of a stranger and but a measly wish for your mental health to improve, but you probably already know that only you can really do so. I don't know if you might already done so, but if for some reason you haven't, I strongly suggest having a pet.If you don't have the time to tend to them often, an older - laid back cat could be a nice choice for having someone to look forward to. They can be very affectionate and generally, people might not need a partner, doesn't mean they don't need something to look forward to.Pets can easily become like family and since you've bought your own home, you don't need to worry about landlords allowing pets or not. Many shelters to chose from, lots of love to give!Edit: word
l6j61b,I appreciate your thoughts. I think I will adopt a cat soon.
l6j61b,Several thingsDating isn't fair. It should be. Bc everyone deserves to be loved. But still, some people work hard without results and others don't have to work for it at all. It is about luck. But also other things, ethnicity, height, looks. It means some people have to search longer. But it only takes one person. Look around at real couples. So many different couples exist. Love isn't only for the few. However, if you are a POC, make sure you are living in a diverse and progressive area. Moving can help.It is natural biological instinct to want a partner. And most people do feel lonely without one. Still, you need to make your life happy for you first. Happiness and sparkle attract people. Don't do hobbies for dating, find hobbies that are genuinely fun for you. Create a life you enjoy.Desperation and clinginess scare women. It makes sense, bc desperate men can be dangerous. You aren't. But when they can't know that if you are a stranger.  Also people are attracted to people who act like their equal.Therapy could be a good idea. Both to help you find more happiness and bc a good therapist could help you figure out if there is anything in your behavior which is sabotaging you.You are still very young. A lot of people spend their twenties feeling lonely and lost, only to met someone great in their 30s. Just look at this thread or search for threads about it on Reddit. Don't lose hope.Don't look for A GirlFriend. It is like finding friends. Most people aren't right fit to be a close friend to you. Some people you just click with. Search for that connection. The person who fits you.Make sure you do build good friendships. And get a pet.You have worked hard. Be proud of that.
l6j61b,I find it very rare to form that connection with someone. Maybe once every few years or so. But when I do, I get pretty invested for whatever reason.I really try not to act desperate or needy, and I understand that girls feel uncomfortable and repelled by that. It's not something that comes out after one or two or three dates. I can attract girls that I have no interest in, but if I start to like a girl my feelings just drive her away.It's something that comes out when I've known someone for awhile, and can feel them slipping through my fingers as I catch feelings for them. This last girl I met over Tinder I talked to for months and months. We never met in person, but talked over the phone and through Zoom. And not being able to meet in person was hard for me, and when it ended things got harder.
l6j61b,I've felt that way as a female, all the way until I met my partner at 30.You sound like a catch and you're doing all the right things. All I can say is don't give up. Looking back at every time I felt depressed and like a failure, I wish I gave myself more credit and wasn't so hard on myself.It really does only take one person to get it right. How you get there is going to differ for everyone. I heard someone once say, "Most people just don't like most people." It isn't the most eloquent saying, but it's true. It makes losses feel less personal.As for your brain development, it isn't that it just stops, it just means it's fully developed by then. It's a good thing, you know yourself better. As for learning new things, you're capable of doing that for the rest of your life! Look up neuroplasticity, it's a fascinating way to look at what the brain can do.Keep focusing on your passions, stay driven. Enjoy the people that come into your life. Eventually the right person will come along. Best of luck.
l6j61b,I will do my best. Thank you
l6j61b,Okay, I'm going to be blunt. Perhaps what I'm going to write doesn't ring true for you at all, and in that case, disregard it:I read both your original post and this one, and they both permeate an innate sadness on some level, and I think that might be what's stopping you. The way you look at the world seems to be like an outsider (tbf, I realise the rampant racism in the world can be a part of this and that is by no means your fault).There's nothing wrong with having emotions, at all, I can see why you'd feel defeated, and that's okay, but I'm getting this sense of you holding back still. You're getting out there and doing things, but you sort of don't seem to be doing them for enjoyment but rather still with romantic relationships in mind. I understand, most of us want to have a partner, but what do YOU want, aside from that? What does a happy life look like to just you? When in life do you feel the most at ease, the most comfortable? Even with life being what it is at the moment? Sitting down reading a good book? Cuddling with a cat? Focus on moments more than an overarching picture, because that seems to pain you.I'm saying this, because this focus on others takes up a lot of your time (seemingly, anyway, from your posts). I think people can sense this about you and that might be why it's hard to really get to know you.If I were you, I'd focus on therapy now, if you're not already. Find a therapist you click with, get in touch with appreciating life for what it is, rather than for what you thought it would be.Sorry if I come across as harsh, I hope you can use this, if not, just live your life, man :)
l6j61b,Yeah, I think when people say focus on hobbies, people are saying to try to find that place where you radiate.  I don‚Äôt necessarily believe in ‚Äòwe‚Äôre all wavelengths man!‚Äô But someone‚Äôs ‚Äòenergy‚Äô is a useful metaphor here.  People are drawn to others who give off energy, instead of people who want to take energy from you.   Unfortunately sadness does this- it gives off a little bit of a vacuum.  When you find something you love and are good at, something that gets you in the flow, you don‚Äôt suck the energy of others, you glow it out.  OP hope that makes sense. It‚Äôs not your fault you‚Äôre sad, and I‚Äôm sorry.   When do you feel happiest? Try to root yourself in that. Going to therapy will help you release this need, and others will happen to find this more attractive.Like if your whole persona was a text message- you don‚Äôt want to end it with ‚Äòplease text me back.‚ÄôBy the way, you sound like a really nice person.
l6j61b,YES listen to these comments OP!! Hobbies are something for you to feel PASSIONATE about and get lost in!! For example when I am running or horse riding I don‚Äôt think about the bad anymore just how beautiful nature is and I truly live the moments. You need to see and appreciate the beauty of life and accept that being single is okay. I would possibly think about going to therapy it could be the innate sadness is depression
l6j61b,One other thing I will say is that I do really often enjoy being alone. Doing things like cooking for myself, hiking, working out, or just enjoying a quiet morning is often really nice. There are a lot of small things in life that I really enjoy.But when I fall for someone, suddenly I have something to lose. Something I have lost over and over and over again. And really that's when so much of the pain comes in. I can try and hold it, but what always happens is that when I like someone all the small things I enjoy stop giving me enjoyment and I just want to be around them and show them how I feel. And then when I lose them I just feel totally crushed and it takes a long time to recover.
l6j61b,I don't really know if I agree with you about doing things for the sake of attracting girls versus my own enjoyment. If I were pursuing hobbies to meet women specifically, wouldn't it make more sense to do swing dancing or something like that as opposed to dirt biking, NBA/Video Games, cars etc? Those are all things I legitimately enjoy and they certainly aren't female dominated hobbies at all.As far as some inner sadness, I mean what can I say? I have lost so many people I felt strongly about to someone else over the course of my life. So many. Often been forced to watch it happen right in front of me. I cannot describe how it feels to have it happen over and over again, and then afterwards to be alone and just thinking about what could have been. I will never get a do over with those people, I will never get those times back.I probably have a lot of trouble letting go, letting go of people and of loss. But when I feel connected with someone it just makes me want to hang on a little more rather than lose them entirely from my life. Because even if don't get to have them in my life forever, I know that when they're gone I'm going to really miss them. And when I think about the people I've lost, the relationships that never were, it is impossible for me not to feel sad.I am about to be 30, no longer young anymore. I never got to experience so many of the formative things others have in regards to romance. So of course I'm sad. We're wired to procreate, to go out and find someone.
l6j61b,You may not feel so but you are still so young. I enjoyed reading your post, and I could relate deeply having been through similar emotions and circumstances between the ages of 24 to 34. I started online dating at 34. I'm 36 this year. Had many disappointments like you had in dating and almost gave up. Found someone at 36. Now I am happy. There is hope. Keep on.
l6j61b,I just don't know. One thing working in the field I work in has taught me is that life is not guaranteed at all. I don't feel young anymore and I don't know if I feel like life has the possibilities it has for me when I was younger. I appreciate your comment regardless.
l6j61b,Okay hear me out‚Äîhave you considered getting a cat or a dog?I don't mean you should get one as a replacement for a relationship or to fill a void in your life. But you feel lonely and isolated, and having a pet can really help, especially if you live alone. I was single for long stretches of time, but having two cats (definitely start with ONE pet though) made me feel like I was never really alone. Sure, it would be great to have a relationship, but there really is nothing like the unconditional love of a pet (dogs are more work but will also love you more than cats lol).And it might even help your online dating success if you've got a Tinder photo of you with your cute cat/dog üòÇ It makes it easy for someone to start a conversation asking about your pet.EDIT: typo
l6j61b,It's all about the bait. Actually I completely agree. Pets fill voids in our lives, and are great conversation starters.Has OP considered volunteering at an animal shelter?
l6j61b,I have been considering a cat for awhile. Thank you.
l6j61b,Person who married someone who‚Äôd never had a girlfriend by his 30s here.You seem to have done everything right, and I think it will pay off. Once the worst of the pandemic is over I think it very likely you will meet someone right for you.IME, when it‚Äôs right it‚Äôs almost like there is no ‚Äòfalling for‚Äô - because you both work comfortably with each other, and feelings are reciprocated, so you don‚Äôt feel that awful yet thrilling fall into the gap between you.FWIW, I don‚Äôt know if your city has many English expats, but in many parts of England a buff South Asian guy with a caring job and an independent life would be fighting off women right left and centre.
kq032l,You're saying this 'cause she's right there, LOL. I miss you so much. This reminds me of last time and we see what happened to her. Please let me know when she leaves.Sounds like he cheated on his last girlfriend with her. The fact that they still contact each other and she tells him things like she misses him is a red flag. Especially since its long distance i wouldnt be able to trust him.
kq032l,My boyfriend told me she said that 'cause she's trying to take him from me.
kq032l,I just wanted the say that when I wanted my ex to leave me alone, I blocked his number and stopped talking to him. If your bf wanted his ex to leave him alone, this is what he would do. Best case he likes the attention/drama, worst case he's cheating on you. Either way I wouldn't stand for it nor should you.
kq032l,I just checked his phone. He didn't respond back to her texts.
kq032l,We are in a long distance relationship.What kind of long distance relationship?  Is this one where there is a definite date when you two can permanently close the distance?Otherwise I would just break up because long distance relationships live on trust, and here there can be none.
kq032l,If he truly wasn't into his ex by now he would of blocked her and be done with it.
kq032l,I tried asking my bf what she meant by "see what happened last time." He said she doesn't know what she is talking about.Everyone, including you, knows what she's talking about. It means she did this to a previous girlfriend of his and he ended up leaving that girlfriend and banging the ex again.
kq032l,You know something's up, but your responses to commenters here ("why would he lie to me?" and "but he told her to leave him alone") are willfully obtuse.  Right now, no one has damning evidence that he is cheating on you with his ex, but he's not being upfront with you, he's minimizing your concerns, and he's still talking to her.  It isn't looking good.
kq032l,So completely off topic question why he asked u to pose with his dog instead of with him on ur Instagram? üòÖ
kq032l,I know I laughed soo hard at that
kq032l,I feel like anyone who is giving you advice is wasting their time. Ive been where you are before and decided to stay with the guy even after finding out about the other girl because he told her to "leave him alone". Youre going to make your own decision regardless of what anyone says and it'll most likely be to keep trusting him. The situation will either get better or it will be a life lesson for you in the end.
kq032l,God reading your comments my heart breaks for you a bit. You‚Äôre hardcore in denial, he‚Äôs absolutely cheating on you, everything you describe is so suspicious. If my ex sent me nudes it would be an instant block on everything and no entertaining it. He‚Äôs not blocking her because he‚Äôs fucking her when you‚Äôre not there. You can do way better, get out of there.
kq032l,Don't invest 1 more second of your life on this guy. Hes not available no matter what words come out of his mouth. Save yourself.
kq032l,Do not trust somebody based on what they say.  Trust them only if their ACTIONS prove trustworthy.   If your BF did t want to hear from his ex, he would have blocked her on all forms of communication.  Without you asking him to.
jmr3kv,I agree that you probably just need to give it more time. As you mentioned, growing up, your parents likely had a ‚Äúvision‚Äù of what they wanted for you in life and now that vision has changed. That‚Äôs probably a bit uncomfortable for them. They saw things one way for 25 years, they probs need more than 5 months to see it another way.At the end of the day, they still love you and welcome you and they also have kinda accepted your partner. So yay to that!I think this kind of like a GPS when you start taking a different route that it didn‚Äôt expect. It stops and needs time and says ‚Äúrecalculating...‚Äù. That‚Äôs what they are doing. Recalculating.
jmr3kv,I want to add somethingMy mum once explained to me what the german word "Entt√§uschung" (disappointment) really means. "T√§uschung" means illusion, "ent" means something like "getting rid of something". Even though Entt√§uschung is a word mostly used in a negative context, it's not actually a negative thing. It just means that what you assumed turned out to be not true. You got rid of an illusion.And you're never to blame for the illusions other people made for themselves.
jmr3kv,OP's parents are still haven't fully accepted that Tim is not going to be their son in law and father of their grandchildren.  They were still holding out hope that they would get this outcome. If OP's new SO was male they still would have some level of disappointment as that's not what they have dreamt the future would be.
jmr3kv,Just to add to this, I‚Äôd say give it time, it sounds like your parents still very much love and care for you /u/sighandsigh1I know when I first came out and got into a true blue long term gay relationship, there were growing pains. My parents are wonderful, accepting people, but it definitely took some time and honest conversations to get over those friction points. It was the same with friends. Finding the new dynamic that works. And the answer may be different for you!For example, my mom was perhaps the most initially hesitant about my sexuality. Never negative, but, unsure. It boiled down to the fact that they had some qualms about grandkids. But the biggest things for my parents were, paraphrasing, ‚Äúholy shit, I don‚Äôt want my child to face the adversity of an LGBT relationship, they get treated terribly!‚Äù And, ‚Äúhow do gay relationships work? Do I have any relevant advice to actually give my kid or am I now permanently sidelined from their life?‚ÄùThey got over grandkids, especially with the pointed question of, ‚Äúif I adopted, would you love my kids any less?‚Äù The answer was unquestionably ‚Äúthose would be your kids and we would love them to the end of the earth.‚Äù (And they‚Äôve calmed down on timelines as time goes on)For the big questions, they‚Äôve realized, I can handle myself. And I still come to them with my ups and downs. I share the good, and the communities and friends I‚Äôve made over the years. And they‚Äôve seen the world changing for the better.For the second. Which, I suspect may be an issue with your parents (or I‚Äôm projecting). My parents got over that by me being inclusive of them about those details and sought their advice. We found together that, ‚Äúhuh, relationship ups and downs are pretty similar, and they have plenty of advice and help to offer yet.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs still some occasional awkwardness, but not out of malice. And some of that is also from me, not knowing how to communicate the topic and/or experiencing the ‚Äúick, not a conversation for my parents‚Äù that I lacked growing up.Time and conversation!Also - parents suck at getting over LTR‚Äôs in my experience, and that might be a thing for you too.
jmr3kv,It'll be longer than 25 years - even as they were growing up before they married, each will have been immersed in the idea that they would marry, have children, and grandchildren one day.
jmr3kv,Try not to be too hard on mom and dad. In their own way they are grieving a loss. A loss of the life they imagined they would have. They imagined their child who would marry and start a family much the same way they did. They expected to have grandbabies and a big happy family. That was something they're realizing they are not entitled to and it will take longer than 5 months to make the adjustment. They are hardly the first people to need time to catch up. They sound like they are trying to be non judgemental so cut them some slack.
jmr3kv,A few people in this thread are being too extreme with saying ‚Äúeither they accept you, or you leave‚Äù. The way OP phrased it, it doesn‚Äôt sound like they don‚Äôt ‚Äúaccept‚Äù it as much as it is readjusting to a situation they didn‚Äôt expect. Of course it‚Äôs not on you to justify it to them since nothing you‚Äôre doing is wrong, but I think giving them a little more time to warm up to your girlfriend is a good idea.Try to find any similarities or hobbies you think both your parents & your girlfriend would enjoy, and either suggest a day where you do them or at least mention to your parents ‚Äúyou know Eden also likes [...]‚Äù. Basically just trying to show your parents that however different she may be from your ex, she still has some mutual interest as them. You should also discuss with them what it is that makes them the most uncomfortable with your relationship... laying out your feelings on the table type thing.Once again, from what it sounds like, your parents are not opposed to the idea, they just need more time to fully accept that their ‚Äòvision‚Äô for you is not going to actually happen, and that they should rather trust you to build your own vision for yourself.
jmr3kv,This is what I was going to suggest.When you spend time with your parents do you normally do an activity? (E.g. go for a walk, play board games, visit a museum) Having an activity often helps conversation to flow more naturally.It sounds like you have a wonderful relationship with your parents and your girlfriend and I wish you all the best.
jmr3kv,Give it time. I know it took my parents some time to fully adjust to my older sister coming out as gay. They are about 10 years older than your parents and it doesn't seem like your parents are unwilling to meet your girlfriend so that is a very good sign! The best thing is to honestly wait it out, let it take it's time. And on a personal note regarding the "normal family". Homosexual couples can have as normal a family as a heterosexual one so even IF you wanted kids that wouldn't really be a problem (happily adopted child here).
jmr3kv,I think you should talk to them. Plan a dinner with just you and them, and approach a conversation the information you have."Mom and Dad, I've noticed for the past few months that you both don't seem as talkative or outgoing. I know that with the changes in my life, me and Tim separating, and now that I'm with a woman, it's probably been a lot for you to process. It could be all in my head, but I notice when Edan is over or we talk about her that you're both a lot quieter than I'm used to. I just wanted to check in to see if something was on your minds or you want to share your feelings with me."I've been in this situation before when my girlfriend and I got engaged. My dad acted super weird about it, turned out it was just him adjusting to the fact that I was getting married and he wasn't quite ready to see that happen! He was worried. It could be anything.Be prepared with all the changes in your life, your relationship with your parents can change as well. I'm an only child so I understand the closeness with your parents. But you might have to start being more comfortable with some distance like you've been experiencing. It's not always a negative thing, but for you it is new. It is normal to start separating a bit more from your parents though!
jmr3kv,I know it's a shock and they grew up in a different time.I snorted when i read this.  They are barely older than me, to the point where we would have been in high school at the same time for a year or two.  My grandmother's brother, my great uncle, was gay, and my older brother 10 years older than me is gay. I'm bi.  People have been gay since the beginning of time.  It was weirder back then and talking about it wasn't quite mainstream yet, but they were exposed to it as children as much as i was.  Have you ever watched a Bowie or an Elton John video from the 70s?? Velvet Goldmine, anyone?I don't have any solid advice for you except to continue to expect them to act like the parents you always knew, and to invite Edan to the same sort of activities you invited Tim to, at the corresponding stages of the relationship.  And if they ever show a whiff of treating Edan with disrespect, draw some boundaries and ensure she gets the respect she deserves.
jmr3kv,Right?! You and I are likely the same age, and I spent the entire decade of the 90s partying my ass off at a gay club.
jmr3kv,Came here to say the same thing. I'm 52. Grew up with the new romantics and Boy George and the whole gender bender explosion of the 80s. I feel like kids today are more socially conservative than they were in my era.I mean I know people run in different circles, but this is not an age thing. Half my friends are middle-aged married gay couples.
jmr3kv,I completely agree with the advice in this comment. My mom is 51 and my grandma is 69. Neither so much as hesitated to accept that I‚Äôm bi. There have been some misconceptions, but they were happy to hear me out and accept me. Both have known many gay people throughout their lives.  It has nothing to do with ‚Äúthe time‚Äù you grew up in.
jmr3kv,Do your parents have any friends or relatives who are gay? If so, maybe you could reach out to those people.
jmr3kv,its quite simple. You‚Äôve had the time to adjust and be who you are (kudos btw fellow bi) but they have not. you can be as accepting as you can be...but when its about your own children thing aren‚Äôt that easy. I suggest you keep things normal with them. Mention your gf like is the most normal thing in the world. Unless they out right tell you ‚Äòenough!‚Äô They are listening. Don‚Äôt walk on eggshells. Don‚Äôt minimize your relationship because of them.
jmr3kv,The did not grow up in different times.  I am 50, we grew up in the same times.  It sounds more they are over privileged and expected everything to go their way all the time.
jmr3kv,And things were going their way.  I think Tim threw them all the way off.  Not your fault, OP.  Live your life as you see fit.  Your parents are adjusting.
nnlyha,It seems that most people are saying you should tell him, but I'm in the other camp.  He needs to come out and share this information on his own timeline, forcing him before he is ready can be really really damaging.  You can help him by having conversations or dropping hints that aren't specifically about him that indicate you are okay with this development in your relationship... But let him broach the subject when he is ready.The only partially concerning thing here is that he felt he could confide in his friend before you, but that doesn't seem too worrisome to me.  I would probably confide in a friend before telling my partner something like this if I knew there could be negative outcomes from this discussion.  She is being his sounding board while he works it out, and it might hurt that he didn't come to you, but he also has a lot more to risk by discussing this with you.  At some point you guys will need to talk about it and you will need to reassure and remind him that you are his wife and should be the person he talks to first, but considering the specific nature of this, it doesn't seem unreasonable that he would seek out an outside voice.Telling him you snooped forces the conversation to occur which he might not be ready to have.  If it were me, I would be more angry about that than the fact that you snooped in the first place.  Just something to consider.  Best of luck!Edit: aww thanks for the awards guys! My first ones!
nnlyha,It's actually extremely common for the most important people in someone's life to be the last ones LGBT people come out to. They test coming out on people who's opinions and reactions mean less to them.
nnlyha,As a bi person, I want to echo the other commenters saying to wait and let him come out to you. See if you can find ways to show your acceptance of lgbtq people at random times, like during a tv show with queer characters. Try not to be too obvious about it! When I was deathly afraid to come out to family or friends, it helped me immensely to hear them randomly show their acceptance of lgbtq people!
nnlyha,Idk how much help this is, but a bit on my experience from your husband's side of this:My advice is to let him come out on his own when he decides to. In the meantime, small shows of general support for LGBT people and issues might help him see that you'll be okay with it, as long as they're not overly obviously implying that you know. Forcing the topic on him could be damaging and traumatic.I offered a little bit in a response, but to put it here as well, I was scared sh*tless to come out to my husband, even though I knew he'd be accepting. I had conversations with a friend first to work out my feelings and try to figure out how to tell him.So many people seem generally supportive until it comes to their own spouse or family. There's always a fear that someone won't react the way you think they will. There are many stereotypes people seem to believe about bisexuals being unfaithful or dissatisfied with monogamy. (edited to add) And some spouses in your position struggle with insecurity in feeling like the other person might leave them because of dissatisfaction with monogamy, or not being able to give them everything they might want, enough to affect the relationship. His fear that you'll want a divorce someday is unfortunately not unfounded.In the end, I had to tell him because hiding it was eating me alive. I was so nervous and scared and serious, I probably came off like I was going to tell him I'm dying. Only for his reaction to be something like, "Okay. You're my wife and I love you. And I'm not surprised." I can't describe the relief after that.Several months later I came out to him as nonbinary. That was even scarier. I texted him an essay about that because I couldn't even get the words out.Anyway, all this to say that I hid conversations while I was working through my feelings too. I was definitely off for several weeks, my husband expressed after I came out that he knew something was up and was waiting for me to tell him. I'm grateful that he waited until I was ready and I'm extremely glad that I knew already how he felt about other members of the LGBT community. That helped me decide that risk in coming out to him was pretty low. But I was still scared.
nnlyha,As a bi woman who's in a relationship with a bi man, I advise that you wait. If you tell him you know then you're forcing him to come out & that's fudged up. If you love him, you will wait for him to come out to you. Please please don't take it personally, everyone's coming out is for different reasons. He probably needed someone to give him an extra "you'll be ok, you got this!" encouragement before making the plunge. I'm sure you've discussed things with friends about what to say or do, and he has done the same.But please, I am begging you, let him come to you.
nnlyha,Well As long as he doesn't cheat....That is my line of no return. If I am in a relationship and my girl is Bi I don't care as long as she doesn't cheat.If she cheats its over.But if our relationship stays the same (Monogamous) My feelings are so what.Tel him you know but as long as he doesn't stray you don't see a problem.
nnlyha,The question is... are you okay with him being bi?
nnlyha,The question is are you truly ok with him being bi? If so, ok, if not, this is a much bigger issue.I can understand being wary after being cheated on, but that‚Äôs your issue to deal with. You did look at his phone. I‚Äôd own up to that and have the conversation.
nnlyha,Sorry I can't be more help but I'd personally think it through for a few weeks and process the information before doing anything whilst you're still processing itAs a guy, I'd like to add that we handle serious/deep conversations better when we're out for a walk or doing something. It's also a psychological strategy used by diplomats to discuss serious issues whilst walking side by side as talking when facing each other can be harder and more stand-offish than walking and talking. We tend to open up more when not facing each other. So maybe talk about it whilst out walking or playing a game of pool etc?One way to tell him (if you plan on telling him that you know) is  to message him on WhatsApp saying something along the lines of "I know you're struggling with your sexuality/being bisexual. Don't worry, I love you and our relationship hasn't changed and we're still just as close/good as we were before. You don't have to talk about it when you get home from work if you don't to and I won't mention it unless you want to. I love you and I completely accept you and you're sexuality because it's a part of you and nothing to be scared about. Nothing will change and you don't need to write me back or anything if you're not ready/don't want to, that's completely ok" but write it whilst he's hanging out with his friend because he'll be able to discuss it and his next steps etc with the friend.You could also message the friend and tell her you know he's bi etc and ask her if she can find out if he wants you to know or not then message him on WhatsApp like in above paragraph
nnlyha,The fact that you knowingly snooped on his mobile phone and read the messages answers the question you have. You don't trust him and he doesn't trust you with this personal secret.
nnlyha,I think you should tell him what you saw.  If it doesn't change how you feel about him I'd tell him that too.  Personally I wouldn't see him talking to his friend first as a problem because he was scared and has so much more to lose if you reacted poorly than if his friend did   I'd be hurt he decided to hide it because it would feel like he didn't think I would still love him and I would hate for my partner to have to carry that weight around , but again I can kind of understand.  Bi-phobia and bi-erasure are problems, especially for men.  Even in the comments here someone is suggesting asking if he's only married to your because you are a good beard to hide him actually being gay.  If he's from a conservative background he's probably got messages like that his entire life, and it's made it take longer for him to understand his sexuality.When you do tell him I wouldn't force a conversation if he's not ready.  A "hey, I sensed something was off and was feeling insecure about our relationship so I looked at your phone.  I saw what you said about being bisexual and scared to tell me.  I wanted you to know that it doesn't change how I feel about you or our marriage.  I'm a bit hurt you felt like you couldn't talk to me about it, but I understand how scared you must have been about losing this relationship because that same type of fear is what made me look at your messages.  You don't have to talk to me about it now, but I want you to know that if and when you do feel ready to tell me about it I will be ready to listen.  I love you." or something like that would probably help both of you feel much better.
nnlyha,Normally i would say that you. Sorry i snoopee at your phone.  But not with things like coming out. It Will be so painfull. Coming out at his own terms is really important. More important than she snooped at his phone. Of she is going to Tell him. Is it more selfish. Because she does not let him come out at his own terms. And trust Will be harmed way harder
nnlyha,I would add an apology for snooping to this conversation.
nnlyha,You need to let him tell you in his own time. Tell him how much you love him. Show him how much you care. But don't just dump information on him that you know because he isn't ready.
nnlyha,Tell him how much you love him. Show him how much you careWouldn't this cause him to think he's got more to lose? Building up his downfall, as he might see it
jma539,That‚Äôs suuuuper weird and creepy. The fact he‚Äôa angry with you for moving on yet he had a wife and kids is disturbing. I‚Äôd do what the post above says and send to the wife and block - but first take a bunch of screen caps and save them.  Just in case it ever progresses beyond social media.
jma539,It‚Äôs disturbing. He most likely had painted me as obsessed with him, so not sure if sending to the wife is best, unless it‚Äôs anonymous
jma539,Send it to his wife anonymously, block him and move on.
jma539,This is what I would do. I don't believe there's anything you can do to make him take it down, but I'd let the wife know that he's obviously not over you and is obsessive about it; they can deal with that as they will. Block him and continue moving forward with your life.
jma539,I think regardless of whether or not you want to act on it, you should document it. Screenshot everything and store it somewhere safe, in case you ever need it.Secondly, tell the people close to you to put him on an information diet.Personally, I wouldn't act on it beyond that. I think he could be dangerous, especially if he felt cornered, and I don't think anyone telling you to tell his wife could guarantee your safety. Your safety comes first. You don't have very actionable information to give her anyway, like you would if you knew that he were cheating or that he did something violent (at least, more violent than obsessing and ranting about someone he's not actually naming).That's not to diminish what he's doing, which I think is creepy and indicative of someone who doesn't view women as people. If I were married with a kid, I'd want to know what kind of man I was dealing with.But as of right now, he's out of your life short of trying to gain information about you. Hopefully you can start to control that on your end, and hopefully without throwing up alarms that you know about his "finsta". I think him being out of your life is exactly where you want him to stay, and hopefully you can keep things that way by not poking the bear that isn't, thus far, crossing your path.I'd also delete this post.
jma539,This is the best advice and should be at the top. I agree that he could be dangerous if cornered. Telling his wife would just corner him and give him more to post about. Block all of his accounts from social media, after first documenting everything. And tell mutual friends/acquaintances not to share anything about you.
jma539,He writes about how he‚Äôs upset I moved on, how he‚Äôs miserable, asking people close to me about me, interactions with me, and seeing me from a distance. He also writes about how to get me back.I'd definitely call that threatening.I'd get legal advice on this, whether you can have him served with a Cease and Desist. The fact that he's obsessing over you in a public way, and has reframed the story as though you left him when he left you, is really unsettling.
jma539,He also looked up where her apartment is. I agree with the above 100%. A lot of the comments downplay this and I think there are a lot of warning signs. Does something have to actually happen before this is taken seriously?
jma539,You're not getting a cease and desist for this lol
jma539,2 things on this I see.1: it may be obvious to you that this is the same guy, but would it be obvious to his wife? If you did send it to her, is it possible she may not believe it's her husband?2: How public is the fake account. Like, how many followers? Are the followers people who know him or you? I ask because, maybe he's just using this as a type of journal. I agree that of course this sounds super creepy, but many people use journals to help them process thoughts and emotions. I can say that most people would feel uncomfortable reading journal entries that's others have written about them.While I totally agree that it feels very uncomfortable and weird to see these things about you, perhaps if he really isn't doing anything inappropriate (like stalking), you should just block this and move on.
jma539,She may know it‚Äôs him or completely deny it. She knows of me, from what I know.It‚Äôs public with a handful of bot followers and he‚Äôs following a bunch of news and model accounts. So it looks legit. He has about 150 posts on it, I‚Äôd say 100 are about me.I agree about the journaling, but if he were to do that, why not buy a journal or use a blank word doc or blog (do people still blog?)? Why post it Instagram?He‚Äôs not stalking in the sense of finding my house, but it looks like he does stalk my public Instagram for work and found my apartment on Zillow because he says things about it.
jma539,Definitely anonymously tell the wife and then I would suggest no longer talking to him or let him see your pages. Make sure friends of yours know not to give info about you and not to tell him that you told them not to give him info. Just completely brick wall him.
jma539,that's weird as hell.  He has a wife and a kid?  Maybe send the finsta to his spouse?
jma539,I think you should tell his wife, anonymously or not, just tell her. Think of it this way: wouldn‚Äôt you want someone to let you know if your husband was still hung up on a woman from his past and engaging in this creepy behavior? If she has a poor reaction, that‚Äôs on her. You will at least be able to sleep at night knowing that you warned her.
jma539,Of course. It would have to be anonymous
jma539,Are you sure it's his account? How are you sure it's not someone else, who was in a similar situation at the same time?
jma539,It‚Äôs him, I‚Äôm 100% positive. The details are so personal.
mgp3y3,My wife and I have been married for 15 years. Had ups and downs, but neither ever strayed out of the marriage. This is the second marriage for both of us(both ex's committed adultery many times). We do marriage workshops regularly or occasionally talk to a counselor regardless what is going on in our marriage. We consider it "date nights" and relationship check-ups. You keep the spark alive by COMMUNICATING, PRIORITIZING YOUR SPOUSE, SPEND TIME TOGETHER, AND DO YOUR BEST TO REMAIN INTIMATE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN WITHOUT IT BECOMING A CHORE. Do your best to be each other's best friend, so when you hit a dry spell your friendship will help lead the way back.
mgp3y3,so when you hit a dry spell your friendship will help lead the way back.Something about that part of your comment is so beautiful and comforting to me, thank you for sharing your wisdom!
mgp3y3,Cudos to you and your SO.I too have been married for 15 years. :)Naked cuddles. That is my answer to keeping a spark of intimacy alive. Take time, every now and then to just cuddle each other totally naked. Not sexxy time (though it can lead to that) but time to just....feel each others bodies, and be vulnerable with each other. Also, even if your tierd AF from kids and life, naked cuddles take zero energy (unlike sex, which is a work out if your doing it right).Also, don't be afraid to repeat the counciling every now and again. You go to a doctor for a wellness check up (you know, if your not American, have insurance or our rich enough too) and your mariage deserves maintenance.
mgp3y3,That's amazing!! So glad to see it works out for couples :)I'd suggest keep going to therapy, keep the open communication. Relationships take work and they can often take a back seat to work, children and daily household maintenance so carve some time out for each other.Best of luck !
mgp3y3,If you don‚Äôt mind sharing, what was shared in therapy that really helped you guys? I really love my boyfriend but sometimes feel like we go through the motions and I want to have the same feelings you have but I have no idea where to start
mgp3y3,I think for us it was the mandatory datenights, twice a week. We take turns planning the date and you have to plan something that you like, not what you think your partner likes. We‚Äôve had at home yoga sessions, board games, dinner and a movie, we made photo albums, even played with lego, went on a hike, movie night in bed, made bucketlists, planned our dream holiday, watched netflix, just sat down and talked,... we rediscovered our passions and got interested in eachother. And discovered there were things we didn‚Äôt know about eachother.Secondly there was the intimacy issue, i didn‚Äôt feel sexy or secure, so we started with mandatory hugs and looking into eachothers eyes for minutes. Really weird at first, but we got used to it, sometimes we started crying, but we always felt closer afterwards. We also had ‚Äútouch‚Äù-sessions, where we would take turns touching your partner all over in a non-sexual way (genitals are a no-go), the goal isn‚Äôt to have sex but to rediscover your partners body, and get comfortable seeing eachother naked. That was a big one for me, i have gained a lot of weight and always hid myself, but to see my partner lovingly looking at me and being so considerate with what he knows i dislike about myself was so sweet.And the last big one for us were chores. I always felt like i did most work around the house, so we sat down one night, with a bottle of wine and listed all chores and divided them, we now each have our own ‚Äúresponsibilities‚Äù, which doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt help eachother, but is takes a lot of weight of my shoulders. For example, the yard is his responsibility, grass too long, or hedges not trimmed, not my problem, I will help him if he asks, but I no longer feel like everything around the house is my job. Which leaves more time for myself, which makes me less stressed... less stress = happy wife ;-).I think those were the big ones for us...
mgp3y3,I was going to ask this as well. After a couple of different therapists I feel like marriage counseling is nothing more than ‚Äúeh, you guys fix yourselves. I‚Äôll send you a bill.‚Äù
mgp3y3,My boyfriend and I are in couples therapy and we will probably continue to go forever. I don‚Äôt mean at the frequency we are now but probably quarterly check ins with a couples therapist. My friends who are in the best relationships do that and it just reminds them to communicate and that they‚Äôre connected and they want to be. I‚Äôm so happy for you that couples therapy worked! It truly feels miraculous at times.
mgp3y3,At last a positive story! It's been a long time coming.Good luck.
mgp3y3,I‚Äôd say make every problem a shared problem. Which is often harder with the small stuff. For me it means deciding if a little niggle counts as a problem. If it‚Äôs something you can truly get over, truly let it go. If it will lead to resentment, raise it as ‚Äòyou and me against the problem‚Äô.That will reduce defensiveness but not eliminate it: but it‚Äôs still worth learning how to solve problems together. It should eventually be possible to say, ‚ÄòSo I tripped over your boots in the hall yesterday. Is there a better place they can live?‚Äô, with the result that the trip hazard is eliminated and nobody is butthurt.I guess that‚Äôs what you‚Äôve been doing anyway with the therapy - you both took on the problem of how to re-spark your love. Can you bring that approach into everyday problems as well?
mgp3y3,Keep what's working. Keep therapy if it's still helping. keep your therapist with the intent to use her again when either of you need outside help together, or seperate. She knows you well clearly and your struggles and what you both expressed in your therapy sessions.But most importantly remember what you did to keep this going.Open communication. Heartfelt honesty. Due diligence to another with your feelings and emotions, not letting them sit and or hiding them.But biggest I think the spark. Setting aside time together. Planning for it. Leaving room for spontaneity and fun outside of the what the world requires of you. Thinking of romantic ideas and things you'd like to do for another and to another in your occasional bouts of free time.Remembering to love and what you need and want in that, and what you know they want, desire and need. Sneaking in those small moments together for fun!
mgp3y3,I don't have any suggestions. Just wanna say congratz to the both of you, and may it last! :)
mgp3y3,If you want to keep getting what you're getting, keep doing what you're doing.
mgp3y3,I loved ready this story. I wish you nothing but the best. :) to keep sparks going just communicate all the time. Hold eachother accountable and figure out what each of you want from the other person. Both sides have to try and put in effort. If you are having an off day just say "Hey Im feeling off today, sorry if im acting odd.or distant." This will allow the other person to not think it has anything to do with them or the standings of the relationship. _^
mgp3y3,Anything is possible if both of you put in the effort. Nothing is possible if one of you won't put in the effort.Sounds like you both wanted it to work.
mgp3y3,reading this put a big smile on my face:)
mgp3y3,Therapy doesn't just help you through it once, it teaches you the tools to do that again and again, on your own. Keep doing what you did in therapy.
j43emj,It's roleplay. You've both consented to it, you're both enjoying it... stage a meetup and have the pina colada song play.
j43emj,You‚Äôre right, it is roleplaying. I was thinking they should meet up outside and have sex in the car or something.My husband and I use to have car sex when we were dating....I miss it!
j43emj,Yeah, just like that couple in Modern Family. They always pretend they just met out of town for some convention. Completely okay!
j43emj,‚ÄúMike‚Äù is just another part of your husband. Probably a part he doesn‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs allowed to express in day to day life for some reason. There are lots of reasons that can happen.Just talk about it. Figure out how to help your husband feel ok about being like ‚ÄúMike‚Äù around you when you‚Äôre together.
j43emj,This! Maybe talk to him and tell him how you feel he would be more like Mike with you as long as it doesn't make him become a whole new person just for you. Just let him be Mike around you more and you be more June with him. Maybe this is His way of expressing himself without feeling worried you may not like the permanent change.
j43emj,I think this is really cute.I'm in love with this Mike guy my husband has been playing. Is it ok to feel this way..I think most people would think it's OK to be in love with your husband.Like inside our house we're husband and wife, and outside we're Mike and June.Well, a lot of people wear a lot of faces. On the road you're "Driver," in the office you might be "Manager" or "Nurse."The main question is... do you like being Mike and June? This post seems to indicate you certainly do.To me this seems like a very healthy way of venting frustrations and finding variety/spice in life. Mike and June could go on date nights, wear funky clothes, do sexy vacations, start new hobbies, do things that "you" and "your husband" wouldn't. People get into ruts and just tread the same grooves over and over.People get tired of each other and drift apart, it sounds like you're re-finding each other and drifting closer together. In my opinion, what you have is rare and precious and you should cherish it.
j43emj,This comment! Yes queen!
j43emj,This is role playing. I do it with my husband in a school girl uniform, you‚Äôre doing it over Facebook. I wouldn‚Äôt be ashamed, I know I think my husband is sexy in a cop uniform and what you‚Äôre doing is no different.What matters is that you are doing it with your life partner and not with another person.Please do not listen to these people saying this is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù or ‚Äúthe wrong path‚Äù; it‚Äôs simply not. There is no danger to this, I have never woken up in the morning thinking I was married to a cop, but I do wake up knowing that I‚Äôm married to a sexy, assertive man. It just takes a uniform to get that out.
j43emj,Yeah it honestly just sounds like they were both getting bored and needed a little novelty in their relationship. This has sparked some passion back into both their lives, which sounds great to me. Try out some in-person role play too
j43emj," Please do not listen to these people saying this is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù or ‚Äúthe wrong path‚Äù; it‚Äôs simply not. There is no danger to this"I have to slightly disagree. If they have children (I'm assuming they do because " he's busy all day and doesn't spend time with us ") and the children see their parents not communicating at all or being short with each other, because the only honest communication goes through facebook, then it really isn't a stable home for them and a good relationship to emulate in their adult lives.
j43emj,Why do you think both of you needed the reset? You say you learned some things about your mistakes so has either of you changed behavior at home? Think about why you struggle to be those exciting dates when you're at home? What could you do to slowly invite Mike & June into your marriage & home? Mike and June are real, let them be part of your everyday.
j43emj,I really hope this plays out. It sounds like.you should leave your husband and run away with Mike. Start a new life together.
j43emj,"Mike" is your real husband. Your husband doesn't feel like he can be his true self ("Mike") face to face for some reason. Self reflect. Do you not think you are the same way as "June"? It's time for the two of you to consolidate those sides of yourselves and be how you truly are IRL.
j43emj,Honestly this sounds like a very healthy approach to your problem. There's no problem liking 'Mike' more than your husband since they are the same person. Both of you just need to figure out how to let him express that side more.
j43emj,It reminds me of couples who go to a bar at different times and then meet each other there, and act like they're having an affair, it's quite a common role play thing actually.
j43emj,There's nothing wrong with engaging in some creative roleplay to add some spontaneity to your sex life, but I don't think any kind of sexual activity should be used to correct or resolve legitimate relationship issues. There's a massive disconnect between acknowledging that there's a breakdown in communication and intimacy/vulnerability between you two, and pretending you're both different people. It actually sounds more like sweeping the mess under a decorative rug than actually cleaning it up.I jokingly asked him about his wife and he proceed to write a long rant on meThat sounds mean.If you guys want to pretend to be Mike and June for the sexual thrill of it, go for it. Maybe June is a little more adventurous than you, maybe Mike is a little more forceful than your husband, and maybe that's more fun for both of you. But your communication issues are still there. In fact, they're even more complicated now that you're "in love" with your husband's fake persona.Both of you should book a session with a marriage counsellor and actually work through the issues in your marriage. Sex or roleplay will not fix these issues long-term, and if you want to remain married long-term, you need to resolve them.
j1flg1,You don‚Äôt send naked pics to boss. And boss doesn‚Äôt save said pics.
j1flg1,Agreed. Even if this is a wide net of Mia screaming for anyone‚Äôs attention, your wife responding and saving tells you what you need to know about her intentions.
j1flg1,Heavily second this. Friend or not, boss is a boss and it's inappropriate to send nudes to a boss or other coworkers. She has definitely crossed multiple boundaries
j1flg1,This would also be a hr violation right?
j1flg1,Exactly what I told her.
j1flg1,I would be straight up fired for something like that.
j1flg1,ding ding ding. imo real smart bosses just don't interact with subordinates on social media unless they're in a field that might require it, but bosses that do have to be smart enough to put an entire series of fences between appropriate content (pets, food, the family-friendly parts of travel, etc) and "absolutely fucking not, what were you thinking" (anything with nudity. partial nudity. literally nothing that can be misconstrued as bra/panties or bra/bike shorts.)
j1flg1,Unfortunately, her friendship with Mia is crossing many boundaries. You warned her once. Now she is doing it again.You need to ask why certain texts have been deleted.And you need to let your wife know this behavior can and will end your relationship.
j1flg1,She denied deleting texts and said she only deleted entire convos of pretty much everyone lately. Which is very out of character. I pressed it a few times when we talked about it and that was the only response I got. I told her this will be the last time I want to talk about it or it will be the end.
j1flg1,Also get couple's therapy.Recovering from this takes work but if your wife and you both want to, it's possible.
j1flg1,You all definitely need to have a convo about why this ‚Äúwork relationship‚Äù means more to your wife than her marriage!! When your partner says something makes them uncomfortable you don‚Äôt get to decide to do it anyway!
j1flg1,Hmm, I think you do get to decide to do it anyway if your partner is being unreasonable. If your partner is irrational and jealous, they don‚Äôt get to just dictate what you can and can‚Äôt do based on their own insecurities. This being said, OP is definitely not being irrational/jealous. Naked pictures between a boss and employee?? That‚Äôs completely inappropriate regardless of whether boss is married or not, which she is. I think OP has been extremely reasonable up until this point given the circumstances. She has every right to be uncomfortable and needs to have another frank talk with her wife.
j1flg1,A lot of relationships like this ends up continuing because the side like OP don‚Äôt want to change their current lifestyle. However, it‚Äôs really not going to get any better because Mia knows she has the driver seat since she‚Äôs the breadwinner.
j1flg1,I had this convo and it went better than expected.. but almost too well because she was expecting it and waiting for me to say something? Which is frustrating since why do it if you knew I‚Äôd eventually say something again.. I shouldn‚Äôt have to..I used your exact wording also. Thanks!
j1flg1,Gut instincts are a real thing. You develop that especially when you know a person. There must be other people in her life, but only Mia bothers you, why? Meet this head on. Remind your wife why you are willing to give her a chance. Seek help, because yes, a loving relationship is worth saving. And its better to nip this while you can still move on from this, without it becoming a deal breaker.
j1flg1,I‚Äôm sure Mia bothers her because she is the only person that sends her wife sexually suggestive photos.
j1flg1,You shouldn't have to continue to talk about this. The first time was her "come to Jesus" moment. For you to need to have a second discussion about a lack of boundaries with a co-worker suggests this is a choice by your partner.
lsd7vu,I am an occupational therapist and I work with a variety of different populations, including people with life altering diagnoses like spinal cord injuries, as well as people with new terminal cancer diagnoses. I‚Äôm a little confused by the severity of people‚Äôs responses so far?? I think everything you‚Äôre experiencing right now is completely natural (the fear, the questioning, the guilt, etc.) It shows that you care strongly about the well-being of your partner, and you were still pretty young when you got your initial diagnosis and made the choice not to freeze your sperm, so I want to make it clear that you were in a situation where you had to make a VERY adult decision at a not very adult time in your life, when many of us aren‚Äôt thinking about children or would understandably be in denial about that possible future.I think you should talk to your girlfriend about your concerns. You said she already knows about the biopsy results, and she‚Äôs still around, so she clearly cares deeply for you as well. I think she would probably like to be able to have the opportunity to put your concerns to rest if she feels strongly about sticking around for a future with you, whatever that may look like. I also think it‚Äôs important for her to know that she is not under any obligation to stay, so that both of you can continue in the relationship without feeling a sense of burden or uneasiness. I don‚Äôt think anything bad can come from an open, honest line of communication for this journey ahead of you.I want to emphasize that while I don‚Äôt know you as a person, you have more to offer than just a cancer diagnosis and a grim future. And I‚Äôm sure your girlfriend would agree that she sees a lot more than that when she looks ahead. I want children with my partner but he is unsure if he‚Äôs comfortable passing on what he perceives as ‚Äúbad genes‚Äù, and the more we grow together as a couple, the more I realize a future with him is more essential to me than the biology of our kid. There are so many different ways to conceive or build a family. If she doesn‚Äôt feel that way, or if this is too much for her because she‚Äôs a human too, I hope you‚Äôre able to walk away knowing that a relationship with you will not be a burden to the right person. And it isn‚Äôt selfish to want one.I wish you the best of luck with this journey and I hope you find the support you‚Äôre needing!
lsd7vu,Hey, I really appreciate you taking the time and offering (free of charge) input haha. And thank you for your nuanced response to my question. I think you make some really good points and it seems like you're trying to look at both our perspectives. I'll definitely bring these thoughts up to her like you suggest. I'm wondering if I already know what she may say, but I would still feel guilty if I didn't ask her. I hope you're right that I'm not being selfish, because even if it was the right thing to do, I don't think I could simply end our relationship. Even if it was 100% certain I'd die tomorrow for example. Anyway thank you for all the support again, your response did really help.
lsd7vu,Beautiful response! To OP: Just talk to her with honesty. Explain your concerns. I think that she will understand.
lsd7vu,This. Amazing reply.Best of luck, OP. ‚ô•Ô∏è
lsd7vu,Fellow OT here giving you a +1 for this excellent response
lsd7vu,Hey! I‚Äôm 26 and in remission from cancer so I get your feelings about not wanting to limit someone else. A cancer friend of mine, my age, just found out yesterday her cancer is back and she‚Äôs terminal. Her boyfriend proposed and they want to get married ASAP. He wants to stick around for all of it, he is completely aware there will be devastating heartbreak at the end of this road, but he is in love with her and to him, the time together and being there for her is more than worth the eventual pain.Your girlfriend has to make the decision. I get your guilt, but if she wants to support and be by your side, let her. If she doesn‚Äôt think she can deal with it and this isn‚Äôt how she wants to spend her future, she will have to make that decision too.All you can do is be upfront with her, but don‚Äôt put words in her mouth. Also not sure if you already do but recommend following thecancerpatient on insta, it‚Äôs a great support network. Best wishes, I‚Äôm really sorry to hear of your recurrence and prognosis.
lsd7vu,Hi, thank you for your input. I appreciate hearing from someone who has been in a similar situation. From what I can tell the thought to break up because of this hasn't even crossed her mind, but like you said I shouldn't be putting words into her mouth haha. I'll definitely talk with her about my side of it so that she knows she might have to make the same decision your friend did. Thank you again!!
lsd7vu,I (35f) am very much in your situation... I am in my second battle with reoccurring cancer, and am at the point there are no more treatment options left. Long story short, I met my now husband (28m) 1 month before being diagnosed this time around. He knew the whole time I will die within 5-10yrs. He convinced me to marry him exactly 1 yr after. He wants kids, I will not be able to give him any... He does not care. And says it is not my choice to make for him. Also I don't want to do this without him, he is the person of my dreams.I feel guilty every day for my curse to him. But I can't do anything about it.If I were you I would stay with her, and love her enough to last a lifetime.
lsd7vu,I'm sorry to hear that. However I do appreciate hearing from someone in such a similar situation. It sounds like you have an amazing partner, and I hope we both learn to not feel guilty for letting people into our lives. And I also hope we both prove the odds wrong and are able to get past it. Thank you for the advice, I'll try to take you up on it. If you don't mind can I DM you about it? I wanted to talk a bit more but if you're not comfortable I absolutely understand.
lsd7vu,If she knows all the facts, she's making an informed decision as an adult to stay with you and I'm sorry you feel as though that means you're holding her back somehow! If she's unaware of certain elements of the situation though, it might be worthwhile to seek support to help you have that chat. Of course she doesn't need to know everything about your life, but she does need to know the parts that affect her. Again, once she's informed her decision is down to her and she's adult enough to make that judgement for herself!
lsd7vu,. Should I bring up these concerns to her? And if I should, what would be a good way to do it?Yes, you absolutely NEED to tell her all of this, as soon as possible. The fact that you haven't, despite dating for a year and being childhood friends, is already pretty bad. And, sorry, there's no "good way" to do it. You just need to tell her, and be completely honest.
lsd7vu,Hi thanks for the input. I don't know if you saw my edit just now, but to clarify she does know about my full medical history and that my cancer came back. Whether or not I bring up the fact that I feel kinda guilty about dating her despite my circumstances since this all just happened yesterday, I definitely didn't want to just yet.
lsd7vu,I don't have cancer or a terminal diagnosis, but I do have multiple chronic health conditions that mean getting pregnant would be both very unlikely and unsafe. My partner of two years and I have discussed this and are completely on the same page: we will never have biological kids and will discuss adoption when we're ready for kids. If you and your girlfriend decide to have kids, there's a lot of options - you don't know for sure if you're actually sterile, you could use a sperm donor, or you could adopt. Your medical history doesn't mean she can't fulfill her dream of motherhood.As for your life expectancy, all I can say is that if my partner only had a few years to live I would (1) absolutely want to know, and (2) not feel trapped or want to leave. I love him and want to spend whatever time we have together, enjoying our relationship.One thing I didn't really understand about dating until last year, in this (my 5th) relationship, is that relationships (and life) aren't about the future. The main focus of a relationship shouldn't be what might be, what could be, what you want five years from now. A relationship is about today, right now. It's not so much about making plans as it is about living day to day in each other's company. Whether you have five or fifty years left, that fact - your relationship being about enjoying life now rather than just planning ahead - should be the focus.
lsd7vu,Tell her all the facts, let her decide.
lsd7vu,I'm sorry to hear your cancer came back, that's a bummer to say the least. I don't know if this will help at all, but my husband had cancer before we met. He was only 10 when diagnosed and went through 15 months of chemotherapy. He was so young they didn't consider banking sperm. He's been in remission since then.We started dating when we were 15 and 16 and married when we were 21 and 22. He told me (beforehand) there was a chance he wouldn't be able to have kids. He also told me he's at a higher risk for reoccurance and that a drug he took as cancer treatment could cause heart failure in his 40's or 50's. I just wanted to be together.After we were married, we got a sperm analysis done and he had 0, zilch, nada sperm. We grieved, then we moved on. We are 34 and 35 now, married almost 13 years and have 3 awesome kids through a sperm donor. My husband is an amazing dad and these kids are every bit his. Our oldest is 10 and he knows that his dad is his dad, but his genetics come from a donor. It's not a secret, it's just a fact. Silver lining, our kids are at a lower risk for cancer (my husband's family health history is riddled with cancer).Anyways, it seems you have 2 issues: first the cancer reoccurance, then the possible sterility. I tell you all this in the hope that the latter isn't as big of a deal. It makes sense to see if you can freeze sperm now, before treatment, but your main focus right now is to treat the cancer. It sounds like this is all still very fresh and you have a lot to talk to your girlfriend about. Great relationships are built on communicating, definitely ask her how she's feeling about all this, what she hopes for the future, and what that means for both of you.I wish you all the best.
lsd7vu,Hi, thank you for your response and it does really help hearing about you. I really respect the both of you for sticking through those difficulties. I can't deny I've thought about sperm donors. To be blunt, assuming I was sterile I don't know if I'd be comfortable with it but I feel like if I'm actually in the position to make that decision, I would have a more nuanced opinion haha. But regardless, I will consider that at least as a possibility assuming it gets to that point. Anyway, thank you for your help and I do really appreciate you telling me about your history.
lsd7vu,I believe you should tell her because it is the fair thing to do. A couple of years ago I had a cancer scare. A bump on my leg came out of nowhere and quickly started to turn colors. I always had a feeling I'd get skin cancer because of how easily and badly I burn from the slightest sun exposure.  When I finally pushed myself to get it checked I had already convinced myself that it would be worst case scenario.At the time I was at about the year mark with my girlfriend and it was the healthiest relationship I've even been in and followed 2 pretty psychological abusive relationships.  The worst part about going to get checked out was the planning for the "what if." I had it 100% in my mind that if I ended up with cancer I would break up with my girlfriend so that she didn't have to go through it all with me. The mindset was that I would be doing her a favor.The thought of ending the relationship tortured me more than the possibility of having cancer. I just kept thinking "why now? Why after finally finding someone?" Luckily, what I went in to get checked was no big deal, but they were able to find and remove a small pre cancerous mass on my neck. Looking back,  I realized by not just being upfront about everything I was being unfair and robbing her of having a choice.Just tell her the truth.  Let her understand that you support whatever decision she makes... but let it be her decision.
lsd7vu,Thank you for the advice and I'm glad to hear you're doing well!
lsd7vu,Ah mate, I'm so sorry. You seem like such a lovely person, I'm so sorry for what you've been through. Follow your gut, I reckon you have good instincts.
lsd7vu,No, dating you is not unfair to your girlfriend. Relationships are about experiencing life with that person, everything doesn't necessarily hinge on what's 5 or even 10 years down the road. Just enjoy each other. She already knows about your medical history and about the reoccurance, seems willing to tweak her plans however is needed.I lost my husband to leukemia at the age of 31. I knew he was diagnosed before we were together. I am grateful for the time I had with him although it wasn't long. I never thought of the possible disadvantages, just wanted to live life with him. Your gf probably feels the same way. Best thing you can do is keep being honest. I hope your situation has a good outcome <3
lgt270,I was in a relationship with a guy for years and we even lived together and he would go on dating apps and message girls. It never stopped even after I confronted him about it. He is insecure about himself and needs this validation from other girls. He won't change. Cut him loose.
lgt270,I did this too, never messed around, but flirted. It was insecurity in the relationship that I was looking for external validation.  I've been married for 22 years now, took a while for me to grow up, but it is possible.  I think she should confront him , tell him to please stop and have her ask what is making him feel incomplete such that he needs that?   Maybe he'll have a reason, maybe he's just a player. But communication is always good.  I'm not endorsing however just saying it's not terminal.
lgt270,Same thing here. OP said that bf would say that its a bad habit that he wanted to ‚Äúquit‚Äù and thats what my ex would say all the time the 2-3 times i confronted him with his own messages. How tf is it a bad habit??? Like dont be in a relationship and waste someones time if you think online cheating is a ‚Äúbad habit i wish i could quit‚Äù. Foh
lgt270,I read somewhere that 40% of physical affairs/cheating were emotional affairs/cheating first.  I also read that partners that cheated in a previous relationship are 3x more likely to cheat (compared to a non-cheater) in the next relationship. Keep those wonderful statistics in mind.it was a bad habit of his that he wanted to get rid ofAsk him what is his plan for getting rid of it?  Ask him why he hasn't started that plan?  Tell him start it now.  Right now.  While you watch.If he has no plan and he hasn't started it or refuses to start it, he's lying to you and possibly himself about really wanting to get rid of this habit.
lgt270,It‚Äôs not even about the habit. Aside from the fact he won‚Äôt lose the habit, the fact that he plainly states that he didn‚Äôt think about how OP would feel illustrates the bigger problem. It‚Äôs not even an issue/habit that requires any real thought because duh it‚Äôs bad, and then he didn‚Äôt think about it anyway.
lgt270,Yikes, I wish someone had told me this earlier in life. I had to learn the hard way. My ex cheated on me so many times and when I put it all together, he‚Äôd blame me for it. He‚Äôd also excuse that it was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and that he‚Äôd been cheated on too. He also called me a cheater when I decided to date someone after we had been broken up for nearly 3 months and had no contact. Super bizarre for someone to try to normalize it but that‚Äôs what happens when you date a narcissist!
lgt270,Opportunity is the only difference between an emotional affair and a physical affair.
lgt270,Simple solution.  "My next boyfriend won't do this".Either he quits or you move on.   That is incredibly insensitive of him. Give him the warning above and move on guilt free. Maybe he'll learn an actual life lesson? I'm a dude, btw.
lgt270,üôåüèº I‚Äôm saving ‚ÄúMy next boyfriend won‚Äôt do this‚Äù for future use, if necessary.
lgt270,Yes. RUN away now before you get too deep. I dated a guy similar to this. He was a sociopathic narcissistic asshole who ‚Äúseeked validation‚Äù from many other women. It wasn‚Äôt physical...until it actually was. Just leave now and save yourself the heartache and drama. You deserve better!!
lgt270,EXACTLY the same for me!! He always apologized when I caught him. And yet he continued, then cheated on me with a friend. Run as long as can!
lgt270,This. 100% this, and same.I found out from mutual friends after leaving him that he actually had been cheating on me almost throughout the entire relationship (even though we lived together for most of that time). I just kept buying his lies and explanations because I didn't trust my gut no matter how many times I found suspicious messages or emails (usually after he forgot to log out of our shared computer and left his email open). Let me tell you how SHITTY it feels to realize that nearly everyone you know knew your boyfriend was cheating on you for YEARS and no one ever even hinted at it to you until you left him. I blamed myself and felt like an absolutely idiot for the longest time. I did not remain close friends with any of those people after that revelation, and it took me a long time to build a new network of friends.
lgt270,ugh, same exact thing for me. you cant change a guy like this and nothing will ever be enough for him. i waited way too long and regret it.
lgt270,If you want permission from Reddit to leave him then you have it
lgt270,He has a habit...of flirting with other girls even though he reckons he loves you.... Hmm.Habits are formed when you do something sooo often it becomes almost like a reflex, you don't even think about it any more you just do it.So he's... just doing cheating on you, without even thinking about it or planning. He's just blindly stumbling around throwing out flirty messages to every girl with a nice body on Insta. He cares so little about you, your feelings aren't even a passing consideration of his.Yeah....nah.You can do better dude.
ldajij,"Okay, so when do you wanna talk about it?""Honey, if I can't plan for a future with you in it I'm gonna have to start planning for a future without you. Is that what you want?"
ldajij,Thanks for the advice. I'm going to ask him to set up an exact time to talk about it and see what happens.
ldajij,It's possible that his feeling simply changed about the situation. Maybe he doesn't want to get married. I don't think it would be wise to give him an ultimatum. If you have different goals in life, then it's fine if you want to move on. Me personally, I don't see any point in marriage but that's just my personal opinion. Everyone has different goals for themselves. In any case, I think you do have a right to know what he plans to do, especially if marriage is important to you. He needs to understand that. Just be careful how you gauge that response. All I'm saying is don't give him an ultimatum unless you are prepared to stick to it. Personally, I don't think ultimatums are a good idea but it's your call. It's your relationship, and you have every right to know where it's headed.
ldajij,Don't say this, OP. It sounds almost like a nice ultimatum and could damage any progress in the conversation you do or don't have.
ldajij,I was in your shoes a few years ago. In my case, my ex kept avoiding the topic of kids and be marriage. Until one day he told me the truth and said he never wanted either. He just wanted me to stay. We were together at that point for about 5 years. I left. You should too. Don‚Äôt waste anymore time.
ldajij,I understand, I just feel like I need an answer like you got before I just leave.
ldajij,It definitely feels like he‚Äôs doing the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to push you away so that you end things and I‚Äôm not the bad guy‚Äù thing they love to do..
ldajij,Wow, people suck. I‚Äôm sorry that you and others, possibly including OP, have had to go through that. What a waste of time, love and energy that must feel like.
ldajij,I agree that one day you'll find that you've moved onto someone who values you and is excited to be with you, and you'll be very pleased. If you have to push him over these important things, you'll either continue to be hurt/disappointed OR he will marry you and you will wonder somewhere in your head if he only finally married you now just because he was comfortable and didn't want to lose you and start over his life.I was with someone for 13 years. BF/GF for the first 10 years. He also would dismiss marriage talk. Then he told me he finds it antiquated. He did the same thing to me in the very beginning about putting a title of BF/GF on us. Long story short--I ended up leaving. I'm with someone who truly cherishes me now. Was I afraid? Yes. Did it hurt? Yes. But it was worth it.
ldajij,I was in a very similar situation for about 7 years. It was to the point that my sisters had to have a conversation with him about whether he had plans on marrying me or not. He sat there mute, couldn‚Äôt muster up an answer. They came back to me and said his silence is your answer. It was embarrassing. Turned out he was dating other girls.
ldajij,I‚Äôm pleased to hear that you have had this experience. I left my partner of 9 years last year despite the fact we had bought a house together, because he refused to discuss marriage and I felt that I had been held back by his refusal to move the relationship forwards. I‚Äôm still in very early days, and still scared of the future, so it‚Äôs lovely to hear a positive experience of somebody who left and it worked out for!!
ldajij,It would appear, from the information contained in your post, that he doesn't wish to marry you. I would hope that this fact would "inform" your plans for your future. I believe the message here is "stop wasting your time".
ldajij,i second this. i had a relationship where mine wouldn‚Äôt talk about future plans with me and it did not end very well.
ldajij,He says he doesn't want to talk about it right now, and yet you end up never talking about it. It sounds like he's just using that line as an excuse to shut down. It sounds like he has some major hangups over the idea of commitment, or is knowingly leading you on with no end. You are both nearing thirty and have been together for 8 years. I don't see this going well. Cut your losses and go explore other people. I think you'll be pleased.If you do want to try working with him, the next time he says that, say "when do you want to talk about it then?" And set a time to talk about it. Don't keep letting him get away with dismissing you.
ldajij,Thanks for the advice. I don't feel like he is knowingly leading me on, but he may be doing so subconsciously. I'm going to make him agree to an exact time where we can discuss it.
ldajij,I see this alot in my friend group and i have experienced it myself. This might sound harsh, but the reason he doesnt want to talk about it is because he doesnt want it and doesnt see a future.People Change alot from the time they are 19 to 27. and relationships do too.  Like an enormous amount. And he has probably wanted to end the relationship for some time but doesnt really have a reason. And is scared to do so because of hurting you.Neither of you is happy with the status Quo, but nothing is particularly "Wrong" in your relationship so neither of you do the hard thing and break up because its just easier to be together.Eventually this will come to head and you will break up. For me it happened when i was 31, and I 100% regret not breaking up like 3 years before when we started the kind of live in co-dependent roommate thing.Have the hard talk, dont let him avoid it. If he refuses to answer then you have YOUR answer. And leave. It will be better for both of you. Dont wait another 2-4 years until your last possible timeframe for an answer.
ldajij,3 years, yikes üò¨ this is one of the reasons why my boyfriend and I made a commitment to have real deep ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù talks every 4-5 months. How do we feel about the relationship? Are we there for each other the way we need to be? Are we both on the same page? 4-5 months is a base but we‚Äôre pretty much in constant communication about anything that may come up and if anything that is probably bothering either one of us. Honestly, I love it. It keeps us strong and aware of how we feel about our future together.
ie2dun,I feel like once he gives her full name it's hard to justify not saying anything. Cause eventually someone's probably going to figure out what's going on and "Oh I didn't know" probably isn't going to cut it given the information that you definitely know.Since you're not on the call anymore, maybe bring it up with your gf ("So this guy at work...") and see how she reacts. She may tell him for you, or if not her confirmation gives you an excuse to bring it up again.
ie2dun,bring it up with your gfThis is a great plan.That way if it just happens that she and the friend's ex-wife share a name, there's a potentially awkward conversation. And if she is the same, she can give some advice on how to handle her ex (or possibly she'll just end it because she doesn't want anyone in her life with a connection to her ex-husband).
ie2dun,If you and this guy are legit actual friends and you care about keeping the friendship, then yeah I would just tell him.  You will come off as super shady if he finds out later you knew and never said anything, and it would likely end the friendship.If he's just a coworker you are friendly with at work but never talk to outside of work hours...probably not worth bringing up.  You have plausible deniability that you didn't want to cause problems at work yadda yadda.
ie2dun,Hmm this is tough. I guess the big questions are: how close of friends are you with the coworker? Casual acquaintances or are you guys good friends?The other question is what‚Äôs your relationship with the ex-wife? Are you somewhat serious about dating her?My perspective is that you know nothing about the relationship between her and her ex-husband. Maybe things are fine or maybe she just didn‚Äôt want to share that part of her life just yet. My concern is: whether he‚Äôs a decent dude or not, if his ex doesn‚Äôt want him to know she‚Äôs dating (for whatever reason) that is her choice and you don‚Äôt have a right to insert yourself in the middle of their business. Going to your coworker -to me- would be doing exactly that.My advice: before doing anything TALK TO HER. Let her know that her ex husband is a friend you know from work and he mentioned her being his ex wife. Would she be comfortable if you told him you guys were dating?She may say ‚ÄúSure‚Äù, she may say she wants to be the one to have that conversation with him. Or she may be completely against you telling him. Which at that point, you have some choices to make. Which relationship do you want to respect? Is it possible to respect both?So talk to her. If you just go and tell your coworker, your relationship with the woman might suffer unintended consequences.I hope everything works out for you!Edit: grammar mistakes
ie2dun,I agree that OP needs to first talk to her. However I think if they are dating seriously, that guy needs to know too, regardless of the reason. I think they shouldn't cover up, imo.
ie2dun,Best bet try to ease into the topic with both parties. Talking to her first might be the best route because she sounds less angry about the whole thing and might be able to help figure out the best course on this. I would not wait too long to talk to your friend about this or sleep on these conversations. The longer you wait the more likely it is that something will go wrong.
ie2dun,Absolutely. Simply bring it up. ‚ÄúDude, I didn‚Äôt know what to say earlier, because I was so surprised, but I‚Äôm dating Susan‚ÄùHim ‚Äúmy ex Susan?‚ÄùYou ‚Äúyep‚ÄùHim ‚Äúwhat the fuck!why didn‚Äôt you tell me right away?‚ÄùYou ‚Äúto be honest it didn‚Äôt fully register right away, and when it did, I was so shocked, I didn‚Äôt know how to bring it up‚ÄùHim ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fucked up, YOU are fucked up‚ÄùYou ‚ÄúI really should have said something sooner, my bad, I really apologize, but you should know, I am not feeding our conversations back to her, but I understand if this is too weird for you, I‚Äôm fine with it, but if you‚Äôre not, I understand ‚ÄúAfter that it can go either way. He can say, no way, or maybe he will be ok with.But you‚Äôve got to say something.
ie2dun,I'd delete "I am not feeding our conversations back to her, but I understand if this is too weird for you." It seems unnecessary to throw in a hypothetical argument he may have. Don't plant the seed of a negative reaction. Just focus on all the other parts of this comment, because it's good stuff.
ie2dun,Say "no way" to what? The friendship? That's fine. Dating his ex? He doesn't get a say in that. I don't think it matters much if he's ok with it.
ie2dun,Wow ! That‚Äôs some good script !
ie2dun,I agree that this is how you should handle it.
ie2dun,How much do you like this job? How long ha e you been there? Do you see a career for the long-term here? Can this guy make a problem for you at work in any way?He may not take kindly to this. He probably won't and you'll be in the middle of some drama most likely. Right now you have a big choice. Make a good one. At 35 work drama is NOT cute.
ie2dun,This is a great point. If he‚Äôs been there longer and has a strong foundation it prob doesn‚Äôt matter but if they ex is well liked and makes a fuss it could be a problem. Really something to think about...
ie2dun,how does your gf not know where you work?  Like isn't that a first date conversation?
ie2dun,Be straight up about it. Tell him that you didn't know this information prior to your friendship (it sounds like that's the case). He'll hate you tonight but he'll respect you in the morning. One way or another, these things have a way of coming out. So whether you tell him now or he finds out for himself down the line could make a huge difference in his reaction. And remember, above all else, be respectful. At some point he loved this woman and married her. And there's a child involved. He has some good reasons to be defensive/angry. At least if you're honest now, you don't have to keep worrying about the fateful day when he comes into the office pissed off and ready to clock you (and don't kid yourself, he will eventually find out).
ie2dun,I misread the title and thought it said: I made out with a new friend at work and I figured out the woman I'm seeing is his ex.Lol, I was prepared for a wild ride.
ie2dun,Well this sure is awkward. But as awkward as it is, I think you should say something.I‚Äôd send a short text. Just like ‚Äòwhen we were talking last night and you mentioned your ex-wife‚Äôs full name, I realized that I‚Äôve been seeing your ex. I wanted to say so before it came to light some other way.‚ÄôBecause if you keep seeing this woman, it WILL come out. Right now you‚Äôre in control of how that happens. If you leave it too long, it might come up in a way you can‚Äôt control or in a way more awkward way. They have kids together. She‚Äôs going to have contact with her ex.
knhazl,I can appreciate being stuck between a rock and a hard place because of COVID. But living in an environment that isn‚Äôt mentally or physically safe for you and your partner isn‚Äôt the right either.Document everything. Make recordings pf conversations. Take pics of what‚Äôs happening.  Make it clear you are giving him chances to correct the behavior and he isn‚Äôt. From there you can decide if you want to use it as leverage to get him inline or a way to kick him out and look for a better roommate situation.
knhazl,I want to add after reading the other comments that I recommend not focusing on the pee.Document it, sure, but that's the wrong basket to put all your eggs in. He pees on hard surfaces that you then clean. If peeing in a tub or on a tile floor destroyed property/got you evicted no one with a child would have a home. The landlord will probably not care. I don't want you to get blown off and think "Well, I talked to the landlord so I'm stuck."The issue is that he's violent and threatens you. The issue is you're scared of him and it sounds like you should be. That is the documentation you need to focus on, and that's the path out to focus on.
knhazl,Take pics and show the apartment managers, maybe they can start doing more inspections.  Not to mention standing water/urine on the floor can do alot of damage.  Just ask them to do it without making it obvious youve complained.  They can possibly evict him without evicting everyone.  Even if you possibly have to box your stuff up for a few days like you are also being evicted.  This guys lazy and doubt he will ever come back around to find out you were never evicted.
knhazl,I feel as though you really buried the lede with this one, and the real issue is that you live with someone who physically intimidates and threatens you.If it‚Äôs at all possible to find different living arrangements (either by leaving or making him leave) I‚Äôd do so.
knhazl,Please document all of this and also alert your landlord. This is also damaging their property, and they should care about it. Document everything, keep a track of this on a calendar, take pictures (gross, I know, but it‚Äôs useful). Lawyers often have free initial consultations.
knhazl,This! I really don't think a landlord is going to like him peeing in the bath and on the floor.If you can, email and let them know the whole story (in brief, but mention that you have tried an adult discussion but have been physically intimidated) and see what they say. Depending on where you live they might be able to get rid of him.Legally I don't know where you'd stand but calling the police if he blows up might help - it'd be on record (and you could tell your land lord) and the guy might want to leave.I'd also remove all my possessions from the bathroom and always go in with shoes on even in the night.
knhazl,Put a lock on your door and keep all your hygiene products in your room. Even use your own soap bar. Don‚Äôt leave anything, not even your shampoo in the bathroom. TBH I would just go ahead and replace all the products incase he messed with those too and then start keeping them safe in your room and don‚Äôt engage or clean up after him anymore. Just look at your room as your sanctuary. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this.
knhazl,If you can't leave and you can't force him out and you can't have an adult conversation with him...I would go in two directions:Wander on over to a legal subreddit and poke them about what options you have in your state/country about getting some sort of restraining order against him.  Should not be terribly difficult if he's routinely threatening physical violence.Cauterize the apartment. Leave nothing of yours in the bathroom. Get a real lock for your door. Etc. You're not going to fix him. All you can do is take care of yourself and your health.All of this should really be in service of trying to get out of the apartment as fast as you can. If that isn't your ultimate goal it's a real headscratcher. Physical violence is pretty dire.
knhazl,If you‚Äôre after legal advice then please speak to a real lawyer in person, not randos playing lawyer on the Internet.
knhazl,This is good advice. Also, absolutely ask your other roommate if you and your boyfriend can share his bathroom until you can get out of this living situation. I‚Äôd phrase it so you‚Äôre basically already thanking him for being so understanding, and that you and BF can‚Äôt express how much of a relief it is not to have to deal with the stress of sharing your bathroom with the other roommate. If he‚Äôs that passive, hopefully he‚Äôll just agree.Edit: also, depending on how lazy he actually is, I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs a good chance he‚Äôs messed with your toiletries. Throw out any shampoo, body wash, etc. that you left in that bathroom before. Good luck getting out of that apartment!
knhazl,I agree with the majority of this advice, but please seek out legal counsel from a local attorney who will be familiar with the specific state/local laws that apply to you. Do NOT go to the subreddit which shall not be named...half the users there aren't even attorneys, they're cops with an agenda. They've been known to give out advice that's flat out incorrect and ban people who point out the inaccuracies.
knhazl,This. And report to your landlord/property manager. I‚Äôm sure they dont want to deal with a potential infestation...which is what his room sounds like. That will get bad in the summer if it continues.
knhazl,Please never ask redditors for legal advice, it's almost always garbage. Talk to a real lawyer, OP.
knhazl,Getting out is definitely our major goal.
knhazl,He's doing this on purpose to get back at you for encroaching on his personal freedoms to be disgusting. No doubt about it. Get him out of there. This will only continue to get worse in other ways .
lqal2s,Stay strong my brother give it time and you'll see how this single decision will affect your life for the better
lqal2s,thank you - I'm feeling much better already.
lqal2s,Wonderful news! I was in your situation before and life has been so much better since I ended it. Whenever you feel like checking in on her or any guilt, just remember that she was incredibly manipulative.Good luck and God speed!
lqal2s,Thank you, this is a good reminder.  I'm looking forward to better days.
lqal2s,Soon, start to make a list of all the reasons you left. Keep adding to it every time you remember another thing she did. Until you have no fight left, or at least nothing to add that isn't already on there.  Then if you ever get nostalgic, get out the list. It'll remind you why not.
lqal2s,Well done mate. This is the kind of inspiration that I need to be reading right now.
lqal2s,Thank you, I feel much better having gone through with it!
lqal2s,Hey man just based on what you've written in your previous thread, it sounds like your ex-girlfriend has Borderline Personality Disorder. The reason why I say this is because a friend of mine has a girlfriend who is exactly like that. Not that what I'm saying matters but I just couldn't help but realize the similarities.
lqal2s,I've thought this for years.  If it's not BPD it's another disorder of some kind.  I even tried to tell her this and ask that she seek counselling and a diagnosis, but she insisted she was fine and I was the one with the problem.  Ah well, what can you do.
lqal2s,Now could be a good time to write a letter to yourself listing all that was wrong and why you needed to get out. Good luck
lqal2s,Done, and I'm shocked and stunned at how little respect I seemed to have for myself for putting up with it for so long...
lqal2s,It took a lot of courage to do what you did. You made the right choice. God's speed.
lqal2s,Thank you, friend.
lqal2s,Yay! Good for you. Living with someone while they bring a new baby home can be a little tricky. I just had my second so this is fresh in my mind. Give mom and baby space if they need it. Feeding times can be especially frustrating. Cooking some meals and cleaning up around the house would be a huge help! Congratulations on being an uncle and for your new freedom!
lqal2s,thanks - I'll be getting an apartment nearby and coming over regularly to help :)
lqal2s,Kind of you to pay her expenses for two months
lqal2s,Yeah, she knew it too. Based on how he's actually tried to break up with her 3 times before and each time she talked him out of it by babbling at him about "patriarchal energies" and how he was killing their future children.She needs to want to get the mental health help she deserves. OP tried to get her to seek that help, and again, she said she's fine and he was the one with the problem.So really, she should be doing great now that she's not being held back by his MH issues and his patriarchal energies.
lqal2s,That's not lost on me at all, believe me.I actually went through this exact scenario once before, broke up with her once earlier in the relationship and gave her notice that I was leaving, and I endured the most unbearable campaign of manipulation, gaslighting, suicide threats, and all manner of emotional abuse designed to grind down my resolve so that I wouldn't leave her.I could go on, I wanted nothing more than to have a smooth transition, but she had demonstrated that she would not respect my decision and would fight tooth and nail to make me change my mind, nothing off the table.  I wasn't about to expose myself to that again.I just want to reiterate that this was an abusive relationship and I was fleeing for my own safety.  I gave very serious thought to leaving in the middle of the night with only the clothes on my back.  In the end I'm at peace with my decision.  We've spoken on social media and the neighbours have taken her in, she will be ok.
lqal2s,she had the right to know to be able to plan and mentally prepare as wellHe tried to break up with her 3 times in the past and she manipulated him into staying each time, so I don't think she was exactly blindsided.You gave her a 1-2 week headsup that you are leaving her in a rural cottage with no resourcesThis isn't a job, you don't even need to give two weeks notice for a breakup. Not to mention he said he is continuing to pay her expenses for 2 months, that is more than reasonable and generous. Even if you are expecting a severance package after a break up, that's a pretty good one..
jtiytu,IMO, she's shown you her true colors. She's not your friend. She's friendly when convenient. I would be polite and neutral back to her--there's no reason to go out of your way to be mean to her, but there's also no reason to go out of your way to be friends with her either.There are probably friends of Luke's that you have an acquaintance like relationship--you are friendly in passing but you're not inviting them to places that the rest of the group as a whole isn't also invited to. That's your relationship with her.
jtiytu,"She's not your friend. She's friendly when convenient." Yup. Nailed it.
jtiytu,Exactly. Just because you've known somebody for a long time doesn't mean you're friends. Also, you can be there for a person, care for them and consider yourself their friend - that doesn't mean they are also your friend. There are givers and receivers.I would tell her "Listen, I was really hurt when you abandoned me, whatever your reasons were. Now that we'll see each other again I'll try my best to be civil and polite, but we are not best friends anymore. I hope you can accept and respect this"
jtiytu,To piggybag on this, this reminds of Honey and Milk by Rupi Kaur."you were not wrong for leaving you were wrong for coming back and thinking you could have me when it was convenient and leave when it was not"
jtiytu,What does ‚ÄúLuke‚Äù think of how Cindy treated you?  Does his group realize what she did to you?
jtiytu,According to him she told them I stopped talking to her because she wanted to still be friends with them and when she told me I just blocked her without warning.ETA: He thinks what she did was pretty shitty.
jtiytu,Seriously!!! talk to him about this
jtiytu,I wouldn't pick up that friendship again. Since she's part of the friend group id be cordial but I wouldn't trust her with personal stuff. F her, she is not your friend.
jtiytu,You do not need to reconnect with her or be her friend. She simply exists in the friend group of you Boyfriend, beyond being polite if she is around ignore her, as she isn't worth your energy or time.
jtiytu,What is the grey rock technique?
jtiytu,Please don‚Äôt be friends with this snake ever again. She dropped you after years of knowing you for people she met through you. Lied to you and on you. Fuck her. You can be cordial but I‚Äôd refrain from ever being her friend ever again. She‚Äôll be quick to do you dirty the next time around if the opportunity ever presents itself.
jtiytu,She wanted to get with Luke (he clearly did not reciprocate). I guarantee. No other reason for her to block you; she didn't want you to see that she was following your ex around. When she saw you were back together and realized it was never gonna happen with him, she refollowed you to save face. I would block her ass and just be cordial in person. You are not obligated to be friends with her. I mean, she clearly didn't feel obligated to be friends with you.Edit: I knew it! (Saw your comment further down) She was hoping if she lurked long enough, she could pick up your seconds and the realization that it wouldn't happen made her realize she was gonna get caught in her lie so she wants to be all buddy buddy to avoid that. What a snake, after you included her and didn't treat her like a third wheel. Gross.
jtiytu,Honestly, I would leave her on read. If your boyfriend also thinks she was shitty to you, you two are on the same page starting out. Don‚Äôt invite her to anything, no need to be friendly to her. If people ask say something like, ‚Äòwe recently found out she lied to us and about us after we broke up and we‚Äôre not comfortable hanging out with her anymore‚Äô. You really don‚Äôt need anything else. If people push say that you‚Äôre not comfortable discussing it any further. It‚Äôs NOT your fault things are awkward. Please believe that and keep making sure that you and your partner agree on everything.
jtiytu,Even better, you can unfolow her/ hide her and it will just look like you haven't seen her messages.
jtiytu,"If someone shows you who they are, believe them."
jtiytu,this times 100. had a friend like that, crushed me well past the age it happened despite never getting back with my ex/friend group
jtiytu,I bet $5 she hooked up with Luke (or tried to) once you guys broke up.  The reason she ditched you was to chase your ex and snag him for herself.
jtiytu,yup! read ops comments and it turns out the ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù had feelings for Luke but he didn‚Äôt reciprocate and apparently nothing ever happened between them üôÑ and he just so happened to have forgot that little detail of his ex‚Äôs best friend having feelings for him riiiiiight
jtiytu,Tell her how you feel and how her behavior hurt you. That will help you more than stewing about it silently.Her reaction will help you decide whether you want to allow her back into your life or not.Don't worry about other people in this; this is about you and Cindy. If you can't stand the idea of being best friends or even friends again that's fine. Just be polite to her as a bare minimum when in a group setting but don't go out of your way to be friendly.
jtiytu,I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the point, she‚Äôs obviously a liar and I would avoid any one on one contact because god knows what she might say to the friend group afterwards... maybe through text so you have proof in case she tries to throw some shade.
mj9zys,I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a defence mechanism, you know it‚Äôs not going to happen and when it does it‚Äôs a rare occurrence so you aren‚Äôt enjoying it and turning yourself off of it because you know you‚Äôll just get burned again
mj9zys,This is exactly what happens any time me and my husband go through a dry spell. My sex drive is higher than his so he would turn me down, and in turn when he wanted to I felt myself NOT wanting to. But I realized it‚Äôs like a reflex, no matter how polite and loving he is when he isn‚Äôt in the mood - being rejected sexually by your life partner is kinda devastating. I shake it off but in that moment I feel like I‚Äôm 14 again and some boy just broke up with me for a minute. But the good news is, whenever we make an effort and even schedule sex if we have to- the minute we start having sex more often we both end up wanting it more and more.
mj9zys,Smartest answer in the room
mj9zys,100% where I am right now. This is the accurate answer
mj9zys,This happened to me as well, my ex broke up with me because I didn't really innitated sex anymore. But I figured out why, she was often times hiding her body from me or never touched me by herself. I'm a very sexual person and she's also pretty vanilla and like's it that way. I on the othet hand like it more rough.We just weren't compatible at the end because of our sexual preferences
mj9zys,This happened with me and my ex. It didn't change until I broke up with him and found someone new.I'm not saying you should break up with him but if your needs aren't being met and you've become apathetic to it, there's not much you can do to fix it at that point.
mj9zys,It must be so hard to make the decision to break up
mj9zys,I just went through this with my ex of 4 years. As soon as we broke up I got my sex drive back, which was very exciting. I masterbate all the time!
mj9zys,Honestly the fundamental issue is you don‚Äôt agree on this being a problem. My husband and I have been together about 6 years and went from daily sex down to 2-3 times a week over our first 3 years, then dropped again to once a week for 2 years and then since we got pregnant and had our son a few weeks ago it was practically non existent. We both have found it almost awkward to get back into the groove but we are both high libido people and we‚Äôre both feeling the sting of our rut. Over the course of 3 weeks or so we‚Äôve gone back up to a few nights a week even though with a newborn at home it‚Äôs obviously more quickies and less foreplay but wow the change in both our moods is night and day.If you and your partner don‚Äôt feel the same way about your drop in frequency then your relationship won‚Äôt survive especially if you‚Äôre high libido. Maybe some partnerships don‚Äôt have sexual intimacy as a priority but if you‚Äôre high libido there‚Äôs no shame in that and it‚Äôs foundational to your relationship happiness.You need to sit down with him and talk through that this is not a can he can kick down the road anymore. He needs to explain what‚Äôs going on. Is he happy with this frequency? Is he masturbating more for his fix or just have no desire at all? The answers might surprise you and at least give you more insight into if this will ever change. From my experience, even if you both agree you want to change it can be awkward and difficult and ego busting. I‚Äôm nowhere near as good at it now after being out of practice for like idk a year at least? But like everything it gets better the more we do it the more we return to our old selves.Now if he does finally concede it‚Äôs a mutual issue then the ‚Äúhow‚Äù is a little easier to discuss. FWIW the way we got our groove back is a few thingsMore non sexual affection during the day like hand holding or kissing - kind of fills the gap from no foreplay time and keeps you into each otherCompliment each other physically. My husband and I are both pretty into each other so this isn‚Äôt about lying, it‚Äôs about reminding yourself what you find hot about your partner and also voicing that to build their confidence. Returning to sex can be an ego buster for everyone involved sometimes and it‚Äôs nice to be reminded your partner desires youActs of kindness around the house or just in general. Help each other with laundry or maybe make breakfast or coffee for the other person. Thank them when you‚Äôre appreciating what they‚Äôre doing. Courtesy really breeds affection.Anyway I‚Äôm not going to give you tips on how to bone down I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre into, but those three things really helped me and my husband sorta get turned on/into each other again. I hope you guys can have a frank convo and start working on it but yea if he evades again then you have to realize your libido is not going to change nor should it. It‚Äôs yours to enjoy with the right person. Like in my scenario we were both suffering but stuck on how to start and then we had this anxiety about being bad at it compared to before and all this crap. But we were on the same page. If you can‚Äôt get to that step which is really step 0, you can‚Äôt do any of the rest. And no, convincing yourself to be in a sexless relationship and be happy is fucking nuts
mj9zys,This right here seems to be the best advice I‚Äôve read so far on this subject. Hell, I‚Äôm gonna have to try this in my own relationship.
mj9zys,This should be the top comment, this is the exact thing OP needs to hear!!
mj9zys,I was thinking the exact same thing they both need to receive love in other ways other than sexual intimacy.
mj9zys,Thank you! I will try this with him.
mj9zys," I feel I am so pathetic sometimes. "Please don't!  There is no blame here.  Your feelings are yours alone.  It seems that trying to feel something artificially or deny your own feelings will be worse for both of you.On the one hand, you could say that his refusal to have sex with you messed with your self-confidence in a big way.  To the point, that on a subconscious level, you don't trust him and possibly resent him.  On the other, you may simply be losing your attraction to him.  You may love him and may continue to love him, but you point out yourself, that you need the type of relationship he is not providing.  So unless, "you get the feeling back," I am not sure you should continue, as the the relationship will then be hollow.
mj9zys,I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll see this.. but I had exactly what you‚Äôre describing and we‚Äôre working through it.I found that because I was feeling rejected, I‚Äôd constantly overthink and hide away. One day I‚Äôd try to initiate sex in a big way, get rejected and feel sad, the next day it might be a smaller way, and he‚Äôd turn me down, but because that‚Äôs two days of pent up anxiety (and also frustration), on the third day id think I was initiating but it‚Äôd be so subtle that I‚Äôd feel rejected without him even knowing I‚Äôd tried, if that makes any sense?For me, personally, I agreed to feel out his mood a lot more before trying to initiate anything. If he‚Äôs been saying he‚Äôs tired all day/week then maybe not tonight, kinda thing. And he agreed to put more effort into relaxing and taking time for himself to destress, and it‚Äôs really helped us.I hit the point where I lost sexual appetite for him, but I was honest and told him it was happening-and each time we talk we get a better understanding of each other‚Äôs needs and reactions.I really want to stress that this is 100% something you can work through if you want to work through it. Your boyfriend just needs to be willing to meet you half way. If he‚Äôs not super sexual often, he needs to put in effort when he is.. it can‚Äôt just last for two minutes twice a month when he gets a random hard on. You need to feel sexy, wanted, and desired. He needs to make you feel like that.
mj9zys,So short answer is yes, this happens a lot more than you'd think, and yes, it is fixable, but only if both parties want it fixed.You shouldn't feel bad about it at all- as a woman, what can happen is that as the act of sex becomes infrequent, a woman can become indifferent to the act, and it's not even enjoyable because other psychological needs aren't being met - like your need to feel desired more often. In a marriage, this is something that can be worked on over time and remedied, through honest conversation and making time to have more frequent and engaging intimate encounters, but as a young women who is not married, it's probably really hard for you to deal with.My advice is that you consider if this relationship is worth the long-term effort, and if you doubt that at all, leave. It's best to move on and find someone you are more compatible with.However, if you genuinely want to try to fix this, and feel that this is your true long-term partner, the first step is forcing a conversation. My husband isn't the best at difficult conversations, so when we were younger, I'd communicate through notes or text, knowing he'd at least read my words and understand my point of view. As we've gotten older, I choose my timing carefully and instead preface important conversations with, "I know this may not be something you want to discuss, but it's important to me, and I need a conversation." From there, however you choose to communicate, you need to be considerate in your honest - not accusatory. Express how it's difficult for you when there is a lack of intimacy in your relationship, and how it makes you question your relationship. Explain that you need this sexual expression to validate the relationship and help you feel connected. Make sure you tell him just how important this is - without intimacy, the relationship cannot work, and you will be unable to stay in it.If he agrees to try to work on, set some guidelines. Start with something like making a meal together for a date night, with hopes of being intimate afterward, or doing something active and then sharing a bottle of wine - even set a movie night- whatever you enjoy together. Do something that reminds you both of how much you appreciate each other's company. Tell him this must happen once a week, or more, and it must be a priority if he wants you to believe your relationship is a priority.As for your personal indifference - again, IF you want to keep trying - it will come back to you in time. This is sad and sounds awful, but it is reality - as time goes on, and you regain a more intimate connection outside the bedroom, and also start engaging in sexual activity more often, you will slowly start to enjoy the experience again, as you see his effort and remember how those feelings of pleasure connected with your appreciation of your partner. You have to go through the motions in the beginning, until your trust and love is reestablished, and only then will you be able to fully enjoy the experience with him again.Good luck! I hope you figure out what is best for you and find a workable solution!
mj9zys,Is he more stressed, tired, or busy? That might contribute to his lower libido.
mj9zys,I'm in my 30's and female and in a similar situation. We've been together for a couple years, and we have sex maybe once a month, when I would prefer 3-4 times a week. He takes care of himself (porn) almost every day, but turns me down when I try to initiate it (he's tired or bloated). A huge part of my satisfaction in bed comes from the feeling of being desired, of being wanted. Being turned down by a guy regularly hurt my self esteem, so I quit attempting at all. I can most definitely empathize with feeling pathetic. It's gotten to the point now that when he does want to be intimate, all that's in my head is "is this just pity sex/why isn't this good for him" and I don't even enjoy it at all. I've tried to talk to him about it several times, and even asked if he had lost attraction to me or if there was anything I could do to make him more interested, and he just shrugged and changed the subject. I feel more like his roommate now and don't expect the relationship to last much more than the 2 months left on our lease. Half venting and half letting you know that you're not alone. I know every long term relationship goes through slumps and dry spells, but if he won't even discuss the subject, or doesn't take your needs seriously, it may be time to consider if the relationship is worth your effort.

lpf9lo,Ummmm ‚Äúnot engaged yet because we always argue about things that‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt cause an argument‚ÄùDude why you with her? You need to both sit down and talk about what‚Äôs important.Is she going to pay for your taxes to be done? Who cares if your sister knows how much you make, she is your sister. I‚Äôm sorry but what does your sister think of her? Does she get along with the rest of your family? I feel you should reevaluate a lot more then your sister just doing your taxes.
lpf9lo,I drew the hard-line when my Significant Other attempted to restrict me from seeing/ dealing with Family. My wife has blown up at my Brother and Father numerous times unnecessarily and then she never wants to make it right. It always stems from her agreeing to do something she doesn't want to do, then backing out at the absolute last minute. Generally, after people have changed their arrangements to accommodate us since she has a weird work schedule. My brother isn't perfect and he can get under people's skin pretty easily. But, once she blows up at them or they get upset with her, then she always defaults to, "Well we just won't see them ever again then!"I respond with I guess you won't be seeing them because you aren't restricting me from seeing my family or vice versa over something literally so small. We made a commitment to something and now we are going to make good on that commitment.  We are all adults, apologize, and let's move on. I'm not a fan of her family because they historically use the hell out of us and are pretty toxic. I would never restrict her from seeing them, even if I had a serious issue with them.You don't restrict someone's access to their family and nobody should allow anyone to restrict them from their family.To OP's point, you can respectfully tell your girl that you are going to have your taxes done by whoever you choose. Just because she wants you to do something doesn't mean you have to do it. You are allowed to stand up for yourself and make your own decisions especially when it's over your taxes and you guys aren't married. If that is the make it or break it point for your two, then you are going to have major problems later anyway. It's 100% okay/ necessary to stand up for yourself if you do it correctly.Family is really important. I've seen too many people cut off their family because of their toxic Significant Other generally over something really small. Then they really isolate themselves if they break up with that Significant Other later and still stay away from the family because they don't want to apologize or they feel like it's been too long now to go back.
lpf9lo,Well said. Blood is thicker than water.
lpf9lo,I was reading some of the comments and I have to say, marriage isn't going to fix anything if you guys are constantly arguing over dumb stuff. Marriage is literally just a status, you two will still be the same people doing the same things. Now I personally am that way with my bf (about not wanting to reveal our incomes)... but so is he because his family has ripped him off/ manipulated him for money in the past...that doesn't sound like that's the case for you though. My guess would be that something like that has happened to her, and maybe she's redirecting those past issues towards you by not wanting your sister to be aware of your income... something to consider talking about with her. However in the end, if you have no issues with your sister helping, then she really just needs to respect that and respect the fact that you are going to have your family involved in your life. If she can't...welp, maybe she doesn't need to be joining your family
lpf9lo,If anything, marriage might make things worse. It legally binds you together. You are now more dependent on each other than before, you have to act like more of a team. If you can't do that before marriage, it will exacerbate the problem.
lpf9lo,I've been in the girlfriend's position before, so I definitely get where she's coming from. My ex's family were all up in each other's financial situations (buying property together, being on various cable and cell phone plans together, sharing bank accounts, you get the idea). They also discussed money constantly. Going on vacation with them was like being a fucking contestant on The Price is Right.In my case, I eventually figured out that what I was actually reacting to was how unboundaried they were, and not just about money. The whole family was emotionally incestuous, which was the actual problem. But if I tried to bring this up with my ex, he would tell me, "That's just how we are," and that I only felt that way because my family was distant and toxic.
lpf9lo,We have been dating for 4.5 years and not engaged yet because we always argue about things that shouldn‚Äôt cause an argument.You should find a girl that you would be willing to engage with. This is just waste of time, both your girlfriends and yours.
lpf9lo,Are you staying together because you hope "one day" the relationship will improve?You've been together for 4.5 years. The one day wager is a dangerous one that could keep you in a relationship that won't work out for years. If you have serious hopes of staying together long term, I'd suggest couples counseling.It's also important to note nothing will change unless the people do, and people won't unless they seriously want to and take determined effort to.It's hella weird she doesn't want your sister to do your taxes and know how much you make. She's your family. Who the hell cares.I noticed in a comment where you said you spend a lot on her. Perhaps she could just not want your sister to know how much your spend on your gf. Regardless, sounds odd all around. Personally, I would have ended it long ago due to "arguing about things that shouldn't cause an argument." At the very least, mark this as a red flag.
lpf9lo,The thing is during heated arguments I have tried to break up and she refuses. Like she won‚Äôt leave then starts crying and I feel awful. She says I emotionally abuse her, but like me saying I don‚Äôt want to be with her and trying to break up is my way of trying to not have a fucking stroke due to overwhelming stress. We haven‚Äôt had a big argument lately until this tax thing. We had a really good time together Valentine‚Äôs Day
lpf9lo,It's important that gf still respects your autonomy in the relationship. It'll make the relationship stringer if she does.  If you have issues with unproductive arguments I recommend reading some John Gottman, he teaches a lot about how to argue in a healthier way in relationships.  Overall amazing relationship psychologist.
lpf9lo,Need to check him out thank you :)
lpf9lo,You reiterated what took me a few (convoluted) paragraphs to write in a meangful way and then added help for underlying issues in the relationship. Super impressive, friend :D
lpf9lo,why is your girlfriend being a weirdo about how much you make? do you not make very good money? or are you like loaded????its not her business to be telling you who you can share your own personal information with
lpf9lo,Especially if he's sharing it with FAMILY for christsakes
lpf9lo,I‚Äôm not loaded but I have a decent amount of wealth accumulated.
lpf9lo,She's crossing quite a few lines. What you share or don't share with your family is none of her business, they were there before her. Who you decide to do taxes with is also none of her business. The relationship is unhealthy.What should you do? If your gf can't learn to respect what you want to do, cut her loose. Stop wasting your time on trying to force something to work that's already reached its expiration date.
lwn44l,You‚Äôre totally fine, in fact, I think you‚Äôre great. The girls clearly enjoy a friendly relationship with you. You aren‚Äôt crossing any boundaries or acting inappropriately at all, and your husband should stop insinuating that you are.
lwn44l,I can see why my husband is worried. Someone in the neighbourhood was accused of harrassing students last year and I think he worries about that and wants to just keep his distance in case someone feels uncomfortable. But I still enjoy chatting with them, it makes me feel young when they share gossip with me even though I don't understand it lol
lwn44l,+1 I wish I had more approachable 'mature' friends when I was young.The 20's are a challenging time - for many there's a growing need for independence from your parents that clashes with the desire for mentorship and guidance that your peers often lack.In your early 20's a lot of mature contacts will be authority figures - so being relaxed, asking for help, being Frank and honest - it's hard.You're doing a good thing.Think of the role as mentor, not mother. You're their to guide or direct.... But not to rescue or pick up off the floor if they fall.You're great, keep it up.
lwn44l,Your neighbour asked you for help, she clearly recognised that you are kind and caring. You helped her in a way that was genuinely helpful in the way you described, rather then just doing it for her. There is nothing wrong with the relationship between you as you‚Äôve described it. I have friends in a range of ages, and think it‚Äôs great to know people at different stages of life.
lwn44l,Can anyone advise on figuring out the best way to proceed? I'd like to be friendly neighbours, but would not like to be the weird old lady messing with the college kids.I think just staying aware of the difference between solicited and unsolicited attention is enough. Chatting over the fence with a neighbor for a couple minutes is different than trying to insert yourself into a conversation when your neighbor is hanging out with friends in their backyard. Offering an old appliance to a neighbor who needs one is different than deciding a neighbor could use one of your old appliances and offering it multiple times. Helping an anxious young adult make an appointment when they specifically asked you to do is a kindness. Hounding that neighbor about making another appointment when they need a check up in six months is inappropriate.Follow your instincts. If you're worried about it, make a practice of responding to conversation more often than you initiate it.edit: just to add some personal perspective. I'm in my mid 30s so equidistant between you and your neighbors and your neighborly behavior is something I want to emulate as I get older. Knowing there's someone nearby who you could count on in an emergency is such a valuable feeling. Last year, my parents moved to my city after living a hundred miles apart for twelve years. Even though I moved away from them on purpose and made sure they didn't buy a home within two miles of my house, it's been nice to have nearby people who I know I can count on in a squeeze. That new sense of security is making me realize that I need more friends who are 10-20 years older than me and who can model what it means to actually have your shit together instead of doing a slightly adequate job of faking it. Especially as my parents get further into their 60s and start to trend downward in those areas and I'll have to do more to pick up the slack. Non-familial trustworthy older acquaintances are really valuable.
lwn44l,Solicited vs unsolicited is what I was struggling to express, rhis comment definitely captures the nuance of it.
lwn44l,This response includes almost everything I was going to say. Paying attention to who is initiating the conversation and making sure that it's not always you is the most important way to make sure you're not overdoing it. Gifting things occasionally is fine, as long as you're not doing it every time they mention needing something. The only thing I would add is that you may also want to pay attention to make sure you're not dragging out a conversation. Sometimes a quick wave is enough, other times an extended chat is nice. Just watch for body language that looks like they want to end the conversation. It's about knowing social cues and all of that is completely unrelated to age.
lwn44l,Um. What?? I wish my older neighbors were this nice to my partner, my daughter and I. We‚Äôre in our late-twenties and they basically act like we don‚Äôt exist. I once waved hi to one of them at the grocery store and she looked at me and kept walking.I think it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre closing that gap between generations, and very sweet of you to help her make that appointment as well. You sound like the grandma they didn‚Äôt ask for, but were given to help them along at this stage in life. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with treating your neighbors like family even if they‚Äôre much younger than you.
lwn44l,Oh that's sweet. I will say our relationship is likely only because we are smokers so see each other over the fence often but they are kind to include me in conversation and I am glad to get to know them in return. The only thing I didn't like about your comment was the implication I would be a grandma. I don't have children myself and maybe that keeps me in the delusion of youth a bit longer ha ha
lwn44l,My husband and I are in our 20s and had some older neighbors across the street. They never had kids but just gave off that parent vibe. The husband stayed home most of the time but we invited each other to get togethers and he showed up if he was feeling well. I took care of their animals when they went on vacation. The wife would come over unannounced pretty often, a few times a week, and we would just sit and talk for hours. They both passed away in the beginning of 2020, within a few months of each other, and I miss them so much. I still find myself looking out the window sometimes to see if its her walking over when I catch a glance of someone walking by. They definitely became part of our family. All this to say, please don't stop being friendly or helpful or motherly. I'm sure they would feel the same way I do if you were suddenly not there because you moved or something.
lwn44l,The fact that your neighbour came to you for support when she was struggling to do something suggests that they see you as a safe and supportive person, definitely not as someone who is overstepping or uncomfortable.I haven't met my neighbour (we've only lived in this house a few weeks), but from the way the previous tenants described her she was quite grandmotherly towards them (not to imply that you're old enough to be their grandma, she's older than you) and they seemed very fond of her.
lwn44l,I mean, the neighbour asked you to make the appointment. You didn't go to her and say 'you need to make dentist appointments! Give me your phone and I'll make one for you!'. If anything, she was the one crossing a bit more of a boundary by asking you to do it. If you're accosting them to talk to them as soon as you see them then sure, it might be overbearing and seem like you're lonely. However it seems like this is quite reciprocal neighbourly relationship, they come to talk to you etc. As a young female in her twenties who lived in a city for university, it honestly might make these young people feel a bit more comfortable to know there's a friendly neighbour around. Just keep an eye and if it seems like they are 'retreating' a bit and not as keen to talk, read the room but sounds like you're already aware of that.
lwn44l,You seem incredibly sweet, and they clearly enjoy your company if one of them trusted you enough to ask you to make an appointment for her. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing but take care not to let the appointment thing become a habit. As you said, they do need to learn to do that kind of thing themselves, but I think you handled it really well in the moment.
lwn44l,People need people more than ever at the moment. These girls are lucky to have you. They might be missing their own mum's right now.  It's only crossing a boundary if either party feels taken advantage of, which it doesn't sound like to me! You're also teaching them valuable skills instead of just doing things for them. Not everyone has parents that do that for them, who knows if there are a few things they may have missed out on. Keep being awesome!
lwn44l,Yes. This. People miss people. People miss their mothers.
lwn44l,Sounds to me you are just being a great neighbour.  I am also in my 50's and wish I was on such friendly terms with mine as you are.  Enjoy it while it lasts cause you never know when it will change to be like it is for so many of us.
lwn44l,Really not seeing any problems. It sounds like you get along and are friendly with your neighbors. I can count on one hand the number of times I've talked to my neighbors of 20 years.I imagine to some who are more like me it seems odd, but it's not. Keep being a good neighbor!
lwn44l,As a young 20s lady I can tell you 100% you're not being a creep and I'm sure those girls love having you around. I love extra motherly figures in my life it's the best üëè
lwn44l,I‚Äôm a 25 yo woman and I‚Äôd love to have a neighbour like you :) you sound like a total sweetheart and I‚Äôd totally come have a tole with you ;)
lwn44l,Sounds like you‚Äôre more of a mentor. There to help with minor things but you arent overly involved.You arent crossing boundaries, she asked for help and you did so while also teaching a valuable lesson. Thats mentorship, and something most people dont get nowadays.
lwn44l,The world is hard enough at the best of times, these girls will be facing troubles and hardships their whole life. An act of friendship and guidance will not hinder them in the slightest, it will make them better people on the long run as they will remember your kindness and patience at an age where they feel most alone.
i71awe,First, it's beyond normal and reasonable to find simply being told "hey I'm horny" and then having your partner start masturbating to porn in front of you to be a turn-off. That's something that would be a problem in the majority of relationships, so don't doubt yourself on that point.Second, do you know or have some idea of what you would like him to be doing? He should be responding better than he is to being told you don't like what he's doing (for one thing, he shouldn't be "begging you to be happy" as if it's on you to lower your standards rather than on him to do better), but it's always easier to change things if you can envision a goal to work towards and not just list the things that aren't currently working.All else aside, it's actually okay for him to be turned on and not immediately receive sexual gratification, whether with you or alone. That's honestly a pretty basic life skill. It's in no way too much to ask that he try simply... not masturbating to porn when you tell him you're not in the mood right now, and then see if maybe you're both more in sync later on.You say you initiate, but does he generally respond, or is the pattern where he comes on to you in a way that turns you off, then gets himself off and is uninterested when you're in the mood later, more common?
i71awe,When I initiate, he almost always responds. And he likes it! We have a lot of foreplay, kinky sex, everything - but when he initiates, it turns into ‚ÄúI‚Äôm horny, wanna fuck?‚Äù even though he means it with foreplay, it immediately turns me off.
i71awe,"Me hornyyy. Be my semen receptacle!"
i71awe,Ding ding ding. This is the only answer you need.If he can't have a grown up conversation about it, cut off sex. He'll soon change his ways.
i71awe,Been there. At first it was nice, he always got me in the mood and just seduced me. Then he stopped doing that and blatantly asked if I wanna have sex, if I said no, he masturbated. The more often I said "no" the worse I felt and because of that let him have sex with me, even though I wasn't in the mood at all. He quickly stopped trying to even get me in the mood or even make sex pleasant for me, no foreplay, no orgasms for me. The "would you like to get intimate on the bed?" turned into a "get on the bed, I wanna fuck you" over the years. A "no" from me was answered with a "I will make it quick, don't worry" and if I insisted on the no he guilt tripped me.  Eventually broke up with him after way too many years.Took quite some therapy sessions to work this out and it still affects me in my new relationship. At least my bf is super understanding and takes great care of me.Doesn't mean that this has to happen to you, but be careful out there. People can seem sweet and funny and totally lovely and then turn out to be manipulative assholes.
i71awe,I experienced something very similar. He would always just ask wanna do it? To which I rarely said yes. My libido died more and more with each time and he would tell me it's been x days or weeks without, to guilt trip me. Whenever I felt like I had to give in my body would resist to a point that he could not enter.I told him over years that he can't turn me on like a light switch but it was always my fault. The rare occasions I tried to initiate he blocked to show me what it felt like and instead of arguing he would give me the silent treatment for days.It took me way to long to end this relationship. I'm so sorry you had to go through this and I hope your partner continues to support you!
i71awe,Together with everything else, that panic attack starts to seem pretty manipulative. It doesn't have to be on purpose, but panicking when you criticise him is an effective way of turning the conversation towards you soothing him instead. If that is (or becomes) a pattern, that's something to watch out for.
i71awe,Yeah, it‚Äôs true that it always ends up with me hugging him and telling him everything will be fine. I love him and that‚Äôs not a problem for me, I just want to solve our disputes!
i71awe,I‚Äôd recommend having this discussion over on r/sex.I think you should explain why you don‚Äôt like the blatant question and give him examples of what you want instead.Also, when it‚Äôs a ‚Äúno I‚Äôm not in the mood right now‚Äù, he should go to a different room to masturbate if it‚Äôs adding a guilt trip element for you. Tell him that.
i71awe,he started having panic attack and begged me to be happy.Yeah, that's not okay.  That is fucked up.  First real conflict and he pulls some manipulative shit like this?  Add in his weird "i'm horny" and when you don't want to have sex....he still forces you to participate in a sex act by masturbating in front of you.I have a hard time believing everything else is just peachy in your relationship.  I'd bet good money he's manipulative in other ways...
i71awe,Watching porn and masturbating in front of you when you're not in the mood is not normal. So creepy.
i71awe,So first you might bring up separately to him that if he's going to masturbate to porn that he not do it around you.Given that your his first sexual partner, it makes sense that he struggles to initiate sex. My fiance sometimes would do this too. He is a very direct person and I am too. But I can understand wanting it to be more romantic. You said you already talked him through what you like, if you've brought it up multiple times and he hasn't changed that would be an issue for me.Is it possible this is about consent? Alot of long term partners revert to this sort of phrasing in their relationships. "Hey do you want to bang?" "Yes I'm down!" It's not an unusual conversation to have around my house.
i71awe,I read your comments below. This sounds like a sexual incompatibility issue he is unwilling to address from his side. So you‚Äôre going to have to figure out if you accept this and stay unfulfilled or leave. I dont thin you have any other options if he‚Äôs unwilling to work on this.
i71awe,Me and my boyfriend use to be like this, I think because it was early stages of our relationship and when it came to starting sex it was awkward. We had a full on conversation about it and told him what I liked and what I didn‚Äôt like, same with him. I‚Äôve had to tell him this a few other times because as humans we can forget. Now it‚Äôs embedded lol and we have amazing sex now ! It‚Äôs just all about communication, it is key in relationships ü§ù
i71awe,he started having panic attack and begged me to be happyThese relationships are pretty much guaranteed to not be good, either he is being shitty or needs to work on himself, either way not ready for a relationship
i71awe,So tell him how you would prefer him to initiate? Have you done this and he didn't listen?
i71awe,Yes I did.
i71awe,It sounds like he's straight disrespecting you and really comfortable doing it. Especially with the porn.I think the conversation needs to be more about respect and less about sex.That will get the message across.If he ignores a blatant conversation about respect maybe it's time to move on.
i71awe,I would leave his ass. Shit to many fish in the sea to not be pleased the way you want.  And for him to do it like that means he don't respect you especially if you have told him that ain't what you like and he keeps doing it. And puts porn on to masturbate after you say no smh leave his ass.
i71awe,Right?! This guy sounds so disrespectful and creepy. I don't know how I would react if I told my husband I wasn't in the mood and his response was to start jerkin' right in front of me, but I definitely wouldn't pretend it was okay.
hpfdrg,Don't pay for anything. Tell her you were more than generous in letting her keep her stuff there so she didn't have to pay for a storage unit for more than a fucking year and she has 2 weeks to figure out what to do or you'll throw everything away. If she tries to fight with you on it JADE her - don't Justify, Argue, Deny or Explain. Just go on broken record mode: Either you pay or I'm tossing everything. Edit: Thanks for the gold ‚ù§Ô∏è
hpfdrg,Someone told me sometime ago, NO is a complete sentence.
hpfdrg,So very true. You don't need to justify anything. She's still being manipulative just the way she is saying you breaking up with her means you need to foot the cost of the shipping. She wants her stuff she needs to organise it herself.
hpfdrg,Right on! It's the ex responsibility to get her shit. Not his.
hpfdrg,Yep. Give her a date to get her stuff out of your parent's garage. It's her stuff so her responsibility to get it. It's up to her how she does that. Not your problem. You did her a favor and the favor is ending. It's not your responsibility to ship it. It's not your responsibility to pack it. That's on her. I assume that she intended to come back for it at some point so it is time for her to come back for it or pay for it to be shipped.
hpfdrg,I completely agree with this. OP-boundaries are healthy and essential. You don‚Äôt owe this person anything
hpfdrg,Agreed, just adding one thing: send her an email or text to say she has only 2 weeks. Don‚Äôt call. 2 weeks later throw it all out and if she tries to take you to court you can prove you‚Äôve given her a reasonable amount of time to collect her belongings to which she refused.
hpfdrg,Great answer. The only thing I might change is that I would suggested OP look up the abandoned property laws for her state now rather than waiting to see if it drags on. If you need to send her a certified letter telling her you will consider her stuff abandoned after x date, it's better to send the letter as soon as possible.
hpfdrg,Best answer I've seen yet.
hpfdrg,best answer here, just do this op but do not pay the $500
hpfdrg,This was going to be my suggestion-- move her stuff into a storage unit in her name, pay for one month, mail her the key. If she doesn't pick it up within that time the storage place will take care of it for you.
hpfdrg,My roommate had to do this with a roommate that left and wasn‚Äôt paying rent. My friend did just what you suggested to not be in any trouble and politely sent her notice and the woman a week before the notice was to expire she showed up and grabbed her things. It‚Äôs a super responsible way to go around it. Though I wouldn‚Äôt blame you if you just wanted this woman out of your hair and just ship it back, especially if she was emotionally abusive.
hpfdrg,She had x amount months rent free, storage wise. What was her plan to collect her belongings initially? This is 100% up to her. Don't even split it.Give her until 8/15/2020 (over 30 days) to have it out, otherwise it is all donated to your local Salvation Army. If she really wants her items, she can go repurchase them at that point.
hpfdrg,Totally agreed, I‚Äôd just suggest donating somewhere other than Salvarion Army. They do some really shifty shit overseas.
hpfdrg,You had her stuff because you were doing her a favor. She‚Äôs trying to emotionally abuse you into paying to deliver it to her. Just give her the option to get it or ship it but don‚Äôt pay for it. That‚Äôs not your responsibility nor is it the right thing to do.
hpfdrg,Let her know that if she wants her shit she will have to pay for the shipping. You were more than generous to offer to pay for half. If you want to stand by that offer, that officially makes you a super decent person. You do not have any costs associated with breaking up. That‚Äôs cute and all...but also bullshit.
hpfdrg,And I‚Äôd get the money up front
hpfdrg,Well if she's not going to pay for shipping she sure as hell isn't going to pay for a lawyer. I wouldn't worry about it if she really wants her stuff she'll come get it like an adult.
hpfdrg,Figure out the abandoned property laws in your city and state. You might have to go to the legal section of your library or call a tenant help line, but it probably won't be very hard to do the proper thing while covering your ass/not leaving an opening in your life.You can probably just do whatever you want with the stuff after a while. I would probably ship some of the small and unique stuff and throw up a quick flyer for the other stuff. Mail her the $20 or whatever (minus the cashier's check fee) and donate the rest. Keep the receipts and mail her copies too.
hpfdrg,Lol. This sounds like a good story for the People's Court our Judge Judy. I feel for you man. Shipping things are very expensive. You truly could possibly buy some things brand new from Amazon much cheaper. I do like the line "The cost of breaking up with her."  Good thing you didn't mary her. You could be paying cash for every little mistake you made or anything you wanted to snuggle. I think you are in the right. Unfortunately she will never see it that way and will probably never agree to pay for shipping.  Good luck.
hpfdrg,Why are you wasting your time?! Give her time frames and act accordingly. And then block.
hpfdrg,You may want to look into what is considered legally abandon property laws in your area. Once you know what the law is you can give her notice that if she doesn't arrange to have stuff picked up you will donate it or trash it.Generally speaking giving a 30 day notice in writing is sufficient in most cases.Best wishes!
hpfdrg,ok well then she‚Äôs not getting her stuff lmao
nzzkmv,You can choose never to see him.You husband has to decide for himself.  If he does want to see the uncle, you ask the uncle not come to your home.
nzzkmv,This, with one minor tweak: OP doesn‚Äôt ask the uncle anything in this scenario ‚Äî she lays down that boundary with her husband, since it‚Äôs their home.If he wants to maintain the relationship, it‚Äôs husband‚Äôs job to A) never bring the uncle over, and B) figure out how to explain it to him, if he‚Äôs asked.
nzzkmv,Yeah, this. For years my dad refused to see my mum's parents (not for anything serious like this, they just had a big argument) and this is what he did. He said they weren't welcome in his home, but he didn't forbid my mum from seeing them obviously. She just went round their house whenever she wanted to see them.
nzzkmv,If you know for sure what he did, then feel free not to have him in your life. You‚Äôre not obligated to associate with anyone, regardless of how they are related to your spouse.That being said, I think it‚Äôs important that your husband is clear on what the offense is and how you feel about it.
nzzkmv,I found the court docket- he was charged, but the case was dismissed. My husband said it might have been a police officer pretending to be a teenager, which is why it may have been dismissed
nzzkmv,I'd be curious as to what your husband's stance would be if you guys had kids, and whether that would be a deal breaker for you.
nzzkmv,Oh my goodness this!! Talking with your husband about whether or not he‚Äôd bring children around his uncle is a very important conversation you need to have with him. I could not be with someone who‚Äôd put children at risk. Wanting to bury your head in the sand about something painful is understandable, but his uncle is a sex offender and that isn‚Äôt something that can be ignored. Are there children in the family who he is allowed to be around currently? Please talk with their parents about this if there are parents who aren‚Äôt aware and if your husband isn‚Äôt willing to.
nzzkmv,Failing to register as a sex offender is not only a probation violation, it's also a Federal crime in the US. If he received new charges for it, the court paperwork probably references the original conviction that resulted in him needing to register in the first place. You might want to go to the Pacer website (the federal e-filing system) and see if you can find any federal charges.
nzzkmv,Your husband knew the crime was something to not ask about. If it was, say, tax evasion I can guarantee he'd say "Unc's a great guy but a shit accountant." Same w/ small-time drug dealing or some other non-violent offense. Also, no conviction means no registry; he was convicted of something, at some time, or this wouldn't have happened. Can't you look him up on the registry and see what it was/
nzzkmv,He wasn‚Äôt on the registry, you actually have to register yourself on the registry for some reason. The court docket said ‚Äúimportuning‚Äù, which in the state law meant a child from 13 to under 16.
nzzkmv,Communicate with your husband on why keeping an association with his uncle is a degradation of your morals. Clearly he should be able to understand that your position is completely justified.
nzzkmv,Are you two planning on having kids? I wouldn‚Äôt want to be around this guy and I would absolutely never want him around my kids.
nzzkmv,Honestly, if it were me, I‚Äôm not okay with anyone who‚Äôs okay with a (child?) sex offender. If my husband couldn‚Äôt do the thing that is morally right in such a serious situation, he can fuck right off.
nzzkmv,Uh, no. You don‚Äôt have an uncle problem, you have a husband problem.It‚Äôs 2021, so uncle would‚Äôve been 32 when he attempted to elicit sex from a minor. That‚Äôs not a gray area like he was 19 and the minor was 17: That‚Äôs straight-up pedophilia.And your husband didn‚Äôt want to ask what the crime was, suggests he knew on some level and didn‚Äôt want to level with himself (strike one) and you (strike two). That he‚Äôs okay keeping in touch with a pedophile is honestly strike three, and I personally wouldn‚Äôt be able to stay with someone who has contact with a pedophile.I‚Äôm concerned about what husband might expose your kids to down the road if this isn‚Äôt a blaring red warning sign for him now.
nzzkmv,Yes, since husband is close to uncle, I suspect husband knows all about it, and just never wanted you to know, so he's playing dumb.This kind of information is public knowledge and tends to get around the family and linked social circle.Bear in mind, whatever he was convicted of, he probably pled down from more serious charges, to lessen the sentence. I've known 4 men who all committed serious sexual crimes with young girls, ages 6, 9, 10, and 13,  repeatedly, and they all pled down and none got any jail time, just went on the sex offender registry. The 10 year old was raped on 3 occasions, and then the offender tried to bribe the child's mother to take the child out of state, so she couldn't testify against him. It was in the news. No actual jail time, except maybe over night until being booked and bailing out, and maybe house arrest, but i'm just hoping there was some house arrest, although there was no indication of it in any of the many news articles about his arrest and conviction.If he has had plenty of jail time, I'd be very suspicious.The combination of husband saying he didn't know, and not wanting to cut ties with his Uncle now, is unsettling. I'd consider leaving my husband. I think he knew and I would resent him keeping that info from me. I would not want to have children with such a man, or family.NOT ALL OFFENDERS LISTEDIt's important to keep in mind that the Megan's Law site does not list every sex offender living in the community. Under California's Penal Code section 290, the DOJ is only authorized to display certain types of sex offenders online, according to the agency.People who have been convicted of a registrable sexual offense that falls into one of the following categories can apply for exclusion from Megan's Law website:Felony sexual battery by restraint (Pen. Code ¬ß 243.4, subd. (a)) Misdemeanor child molestation (Pen. Code ¬ß 647.6), or former section 647(a) Any offense which did not involve penetration or oral copulation, the victim of which was a child, stepchild, grandchild, or sibling of the offender, and for which the offender successfully completed or is successfully completing probation Felony child pornography conviction (Pen. Code ¬ß¬ß 311.1, 311.2 subd. (b), (c) or (d), or Pen. Code ¬ß¬ß 311.3, 311.4, 311.10, or 311.11) where the victim was at least 16 years of age or older What's more, on any given offender profile, take note of the statement which reads "The Department of Justice has no information about a subsequent felony incarceration for this registrant."
nzzkmv,You need to look into what the conviction was for (if he's held to probation and has to register as a sex offender there was absolutely a conviction or guilty plea, a dismissal can't require either of these).It is OK to tell your husband that you will never see his uncle again and neither will any future children(should that be something you're planning)
nzzkmv,You just have to ask, if I have children with this man, will he take them around his uncle? Can he be trusted not to? It seems harsh but for me once a line is crossed it cannot be uncrossed and there is no coming back from something like that. And the fact that your husband would even consider seeing his uncle is troubling.
nzzkmv,Ok so... The uncle with whom your husband was close, went to jail and your husband never knew the reason?? Like, "oh my uncle who I really like is going to jail!! I won't ask him why, though, and I definitely won't try to find out". I'm having great difficulty believing him.
nzzkmv,Idk I believe him. He‚Äôs very good about intentionally avoiding finding out about something if he wants to. However, he knows now and he can‚Äôt avoid it.
nd7i09,Do you have an actual budget? Most people say they know how much they spend but don't actually have a verified, written down budget. Tell your wife that you're excited about making a budget so you can figure out how to plan to make your dreams come through. Making a budget isn't a big scary thing, for some people it's actually very fun. Since your wife seems impractical I would suggest doing it like this: you start with how much you think you're spending.  Let her throw the numbers out. If you disagree with a number, put hers down and put your guestimate next to hers.  Don't forget bills that are annual such as insurance or taxes. Break it down as specific as possible. Her salon costs, yours, be as specific as possible.  Groceries eating out together, eating out for lunch, paper good, different categories.Next, take a look at your credit cards and bank accounts. Many can be searched by category or there's services like Mint that are free and will categorize everything for you.  Go back at least 3 months to get an accurate average.  Now go back and fill out how much you've actually been spending. There will be things that surprise you. Hopefully for your wife she will be surprised to see how tight things actually are.because I‚Äôm the higher-earner, I have to be the one to decide what we can and cannot afford, and this tends to turn me into a villainYou're not the villain, you just need a partner.  In a way, being in charge of the finances is a positive because you can safe guard them. I'm in charge of ours even though I'm unemployed right now. I'm saying "no" monthly but always willing to make a savings goal with my husband.Once you have an actual budget and idea of what's being spent written down, talk about it. Talk about goals. Keep an open mind even though she's impractical about some things. For instance, my husband didn't think we'd be able to buy a house, we made it work in the budget and we ended up not putting anything down and so our mortgage/insurance/property tax is cheaper than our old rent payment. Our utilities are less too (because we're careful about our usage).  I'm hoping the budget + goals will help your wife feel more educated and empowered so instead of feeling frustrated about not moving somewhere nicer before house hunting, she feels like she's helping get closer to the goal. None of things she wants are impractical, the timeline (as in asap!) is.  Maybe the budget and goals being written down can help her have patience, cut some costs, and not make you the bad guy.
nd7i09,This. If there‚Äôs hope of being able to emerge together on the other side of this, you need to see if she is willing / able to be an equal partner to you - not in terms of earning the same amount, but in terms of you BOTH worrying about $$ / thinking about the same long-term financial goals.You seem to be able to list out the specific costs of recent purchases. How much is she thinking about these numbers in the day to day? It‚Äôs not fair to you to be the only ‚Äúadult‚Äù in the relationship.
nd7i09,This! Myself (27 m) and my husband (26 m) grew up very different and he very literally had no concept of money or budgeting until....I sat him down and we each wrote down all of our debit and credit card purchases in categories... when he saw that he was spending hundreds of dollars on fast food, and also hundreds of dollars on online shopping and was spending more than he earned on fun things for himself  while I was paying all the bills and supporting his spending habits he was shocked... he had no idea he hadn‚Äôt technically paid bills in months... and I had enabled that behavioryour wife needs to see what y‚Äôall are spending to understand and then together y‚Äôall can write out future purchases you would like to make and prioritize them and budget for them because at this point you‚Äôre financing her poor money management and she doesn‚Äôt realize how bad it is either...I‚Äôm not saying y‚Äôall both need to pay bills fifty fifty... one person earns more so it makes sense they would pay more... but if she isn‚Äôt paying her share... that needs to be fixed... and until she can pay her share she can‚Äôt be making these demands...I‚Äôd also be concerned about her lying/stretching the truth to you as well...like with the dental work thing
nd7i09,‚Äú...for some people it is actually very fun.‚ÄùMe!! I‚Äôve been using YNAB for the past 7 years and I highly recommend it. My partner doesn‚Äôt budget and I don‚Äôt understand how. I start to get nervous if I haven‚Äôt looked at things for a few weeks to make sure I‚Äôm on track.
nd7i09,this won't work. some people just want to spend every dime and go into debt. they don't  understand money. if he earns a $1million a year, she will spend it all.its the personality. people like that do not change.
nd7i09,Invisalign isn't good for jaw misalignment issues such as over/under bite. If this is the first time in her life anybody has mentioned any sort of corrective orthodontia to her, it's likely a scam. (Unless she's had some sort of facial trauma in between.)Lots of dentists "prescribe" Invisalign to everybody because it is a huge moneymaker for them, and they barely have to do anything for their cut. I know of a few who are notorious for this. Not all dentists scam, but some do.Unless you're going to a ridiculous "Beverly Hills" dentist to the stars-type, a filling isn't going to cost you anymore than $100, and will likely be much closer $40-50, especially if you have some insurance. Waiting to have that filling addressed can cost you a lot more down the line.Tl;Dr: get a second opinion for the Invisalign, but fill your freaking cavity.
nd7i09,Second the getting a filling ASAP
nd7i09,I am in my 40s and a recent dentist told me i needed braces and recommended invisalign. every other dentist i saw for decades send my teeth are only slightly crooked. It felt like she was a sales person selling me shit. I never went back. it was total bullshit.new dentist. you don't need braces. just like all the others.
nd7i09,Had overbite, misaligned jaws, gapped front teeth, and narrow jaws.  None of these conditions were going to make my damn teeth fall out.  Only after my ortho moved my bones and resized my bite did we even goto invisalign.  Methinks she is exaggerating or the dentist is selling her a lie.
nd7i09,If her condition is serious enough that her teeth will fall out, she would need way more than braces. My boyfriend just under went major double jaw surgery for that exact concern, costing his insurance 100k plus his braces. If it‚Äôs just braces I would honestly have her set up a payment plan and pay it herself.
nd7i09,Depending on her bite as well, braces can only do so much. I feel like not enough people understand that before they put all that money into it.Edited: You 100% just said this exact thing. Sorry, im tired today ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
nd7i09,I went to a dentist (it was a dental chain, like WalMart for teeth, one in every town) because I was sure I had a cavity. They didn't even look at my teeth aside from xrays, but they did tell me I needed Invisalign because my two front teeth are slightly flared. (Which I knew about. A dentist told my parents that when I was young. That dentist also said he could do braces, but it would be for vanity reasons and my two front teeth won't affect anything). They said I couldn't leave until I watched a video, they said it was mandated. The video was an Invisalign promo video. And it absolutely said that if your teeth are misaligned or overlap, bacteria will get stuck and you won't be able to get it out and it will fit your teeth and your teeth will fall out. It included a lot of gorey and scary visuals.It was an obvious scam. But maybe OPs wife is a little more gullible than I am?
nd7i09,Just to say, I have ‚Äúgood‚Äù dental insurance and fillings are still almost $200 each. It‚Äôs pretty common to cost that much, especially in big cities.
j032q3,So, let‚Äôs get this straight:You‚Äôre in a relationship with an alcoholic who doesn‚Äôt understand or care how much work you put into your actual job, instead thinking that your job is so frickin‚Äô easy that you should not just be able to, but rather feel obligated to care for the home more or less on your own.He continually brings this up to the point where you feel so unsure that you have to ask others to validate that you‚Äôre not crazy for expecting even the most basic respect for your work.You‚Äôve already spoken to him about this and he still continues to ignore that and instead repeats the same entitled bullshit as earlier.You don‚Äôt have a boyfriend. You have a grown child.Does he bring anything positive to your life?If you have kids down the line and your kid ends up with a man like your boyfriend, would you be happy for them?If a friend of yours came to you and told you everything you‚Äôve told us (and no doubt a hell of a lot more issues) would you advise them to stay and work it out?Because I wouldn‚Äôt.Why are you still with this raging dumpster fire in a human-shaped-suit?
j032q3,raging dumpster fire in a human-shaped-suit?Best description I've heard!
j032q3,But but ....she loves him. So she cant possibly leave /s
j032q3,I completely get what you‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs emotionally exhausting because stuff like this happens and he turns around the next day and apologizes for what he says/does. Just as he did today.I did feel awful though - like maybe I should be doing more to help around the house. Some friends have the immediate reaction of something like, ‚Äúoh you work from home? That‚Äôs awesome! You must be able to get so much done!‚Äù Like, that‚Äôs the first thing some people think. I never worked from home before COVID so it‚Äôs been a whole different experience for me.Reasons to stay? It‚Äôs hard to articulate why. I don‚Äôt come up with many great reasons. It‚Äôs just very confusing when he‚Äôs a normal person who says normal things but all of a sudden he turns into a different person sometimes. And a lot of the time I feel like I try so hard but I have trouble paying for all my bills (like student loans, car, car insurance, etc.) I just don‚Äôt have anyone else. I have friends, but I don‚Äôt really have a family here anymore.
j032q3,Right? I read the first sentence of the second paragraph and wondered why there are still more text afterwards.
j032q3,Seriously. He has time to drink every day, but you're spending almost all of your waking hours actually working?!? This guy is an entitled d**che, and living with him and letting him speak to you that way is enabling him. I work in retail, my boyfriend works from home, and sometimes I'll ask him while I'm out, to please take X out of the freezer, or toss Y to the laundry room, bit that's one simple task that's helping me when I get home, if it gets forgotten, ah well.You need to leave him. How th hell is living with an alcoholic contributing to your life in a healthy way at all?
j032q3,I agree run. You can argue semantics all you want, but you will never get anywhere with this man. His main relationship is with alcohol. You are an aside, and it will only get worse with time.
j032q3,My take on this: he has been as alcoholic as long as OP can remember  so she has no excuse for picking this man.  Just dump his ass.  No excuses.
j032q3,because she's a co-dependent enabling this persons behavior while ruining and wasting her own life away.she needs to seek treatment herself, probably should look up Al-Anon
j032q3,As the daughter of an alcoholic, please, OP, do not marry and have children with this man. Get out while you can all of this behavour will just get worse.
j032q3,What is a pink collar job?? Just another word for white collar?ETA: I just looked it up and apparently it's a job primarily held by women. Idk why you chose to describe her job as pink collar. Wouldn't that be something like housekeeping or nursing or nannying? Her job sounds pretty run of the mill white collar to me. I'm guessing she's a graphic designer honestly. Or a web designer.
j032q3,This post should be about why you are dating an alcoholic. It is not about chores.
j032q3,Lady.. ^ this. Please leave this man.
j032q3,Girl. He's an abusive alcoholic. Leave him.
j032q3,If your partner weren't an alcoholic, he's find a lot more time to do chores.I think it's clear this isn't a good relationship for you, and possibly not for him either. But if you aren't going to leave and he isn't going to get help, then i think you just need to divide up the chores (evenly) and then stick to the division.
j032q3,So he doesn't understand that working from home is still working. You can't make him understand, either he doesn't want to understand because that way it's easy to give you shit for not doing all the chores, or he's dumb.Do you realise that the majority of his attitude come from his alcoholism? You are dating an empty shell of a man.So tonight he drank his booze and got angry with me that some things haven‚Äôt been done, that he worked a 12 hour day and that I should be able to pull away from work ‚Äúfor five minutes‚Äù to do these things. I was still working on my freelance work, but I went to the bedroom to get away from him. A couple minutes later he opens the door to tell me I act like I do so much but I‚Äôm just lazy and then proceeded to slam the door.I‚Äôm angry and frustrated - I‚Äôm wondering if maybe I‚Äôm just the a**hole. A lot of the time I‚Äôm usually able to do the dishes and get some laundry done but I feel like his expectancy of what I do around the house has shifted ever since I‚Äôve been working from home.No, you are not the a**hole here. I'm honestly not sure what's keeping you in this dumpster fire of a relationship. Can you list three things that are keeping you with him? I love him doesn't count because love is not enough to make a relationship work and your post proves that, so what in the world is so great about this dude? You sound so miserable, sad and unsatisfied, your life seems to revolve around working, cleaning and fighting with your always drunk boyfriend. Is this the life you want for yourself?
j032q3,There's a number of issues here. I would just ask that you consider what he adds to your life other than paying half the bills. Does he even do that? Would your life be better if you had a roommate instead?
j032q3,Well, we‚Äôve lived in his father‚Äôs basement all this time. He‚Äôs turned it into (somewhat) of an apartment. I contribute to some bills, but sometimes he holds it over my head that he splits the main bills with his dad for the house.I‚Äôve thought about getting an apartment and a roommate plenty, but all my friends are on different life paths or live too far away. I‚Äôve done the math and I couldn‚Äôt afford a place on my own with all bill/debt I have to pay for monthly. I don‚Äôt really have anywhere else to go.Thank you for taking the time to comment though, I‚Äôll be thinking about all of these.
j032q3,I was in a similar situation, although not with the WFH aspect. He was projecting why his life wasn‚Äôt farther along/better on me. Every thing that I ‚Äúfixed‚Äù at his insistence became something else. First it was chores. Then bills. Then sex. You aren‚Äôt going to get peace unless he addresses his alcoholism and the reasons behind it. And honestly it doesn‚Äôt sound like sticking around for.
j032q3,this relationship honestly sounds abusive, is there anywhere else you can stay for a little while?
j032q3,Is this the same boyfriend that didn't want you to get help because of your depression?
j032q3,As an alcoholic in recovery, I can without a doubt tell you that this guy's wires are crossed, and he will never "get it."It'll take him years after he puts down the drink to even begin to be ready to process things in a healthy manner.
j032q3,Codepency and alcoholism is like one of the most iconic duos.You may have fallen into this pattern because of your own predispositions.It's been awhile since I've read this sub and now I remember why I used to read it so much.  What you've written is very true.
j032q3,Forget trying to communicate with him about how you are trying your very best.  You should be telling him HE should be doing those chores, not you. He works fewer hours than you do. On those occasional Wednesdays he gets off, he should be doing the laundry and other chores, not sitting on his sexist ass guzzling grog all day and abusing you.
hwf9p2,Wait. YOU have to live THE REST OF YOUR LIFE with a dead bedroom because SHE is too dependent on YOU? How does this work? You need a therapist to learn to set boundaries and take control of YOUR life. You are freaking THIRTY. You do not owe her the rest of your life of for money. You just don't.
hwf9p2,Yeah, like, unless she had a traumatic brain injury or something and needs OP's insurance to get care for the rest of her life, he isn't obligated to stay married to her (And even then he'd be ethically cleared to find himself a gf at least).
hwf9p2,Ok, but it sounds like this guy is coming from a culture where women might not have options to support themselves outside of marriage, and where they might face extreme ostracism of they are divorced. Also it sounds like a culture with compulsory heteronormativity, where she might be lesbian or asexual, might not even have known this about herself, and was pressured into marrying a man. It's tragic for all parties. At least they get along well, OP sounds like a really sweet guy.Basically, women's rights are important for men too. If a woman is pressured into marrying you, and her life would be ruined if you left her, you're kind of stuck, ethically.
hwf9p2,You‚Äôre going to spend the rest of you life like this because your wife can‚Äôt take care of herself? You need to find a therapist and seriously rethink this. You don‚Äôt need a sex therapist, you need a therapist to help you stand up for yourself and get out of this situation. Fifty more years of this?
hwf9p2,PS: Divorce isn't really an option. She's too dependent on me.You do realize this is the ONLY life you get and that you are wasting it, right? Tell her that you will be filing for divorce in 6 months, so she has until then to become more independent. If she chooses not to take the steps to make that happen, then that is her own fault - you can't let her take advantage of you and use you for support while giving nothing back just because she's dependent on you.
hwf9p2,You do realise him saying she's too dependent on him is a way of him avoiding his own fears of being alone and independent right
hwf9p2,She‚Äôs a 30ish year old woman, she isn‚Äôt a dependant child or sick elderly relative.. she can make her own life surely? Sorry if that‚Äôs not possible where you live and it‚Äôs a cultural thing, there‚Äôs no judgement meant but man, I feel genuinely saddened by your stories. You can‚Äôt just give up on true romantic love at 30 even if she is your best friend and partner.
hwf9p2,Well actually we don't know for sure if it's the only life, but yeah it would be a waste if he stay with a person 50 year being unhappy.
hwf9p2,Divorce and be done with it. You live once, live happy.
hwf9p2,Right? I will never understand OP‚Äôs defeatism. Life is so so short, why CHOOSE misery?
hwf9p2,I think a lot of us here are looking at your situation from a very "western" lens where what's being suggested is societally within what is deemed as normal.I also completely understand that from your perspective, your update is in actuality a huge life improvement compared to when you first posted here. Additionally, cultural pressure is a thing especially when it's been entrenched from birth.That being said, everything being said to you here about your marriage are true. Your wife is still taking far more than she is giving. To not give you intimacy but also demand you be technically celibate is abuse, manipulation and selfishness all wrapped up into one.Not only that, her emotional dependency has become designed around you satisfying that need without any giving back. She has essentially molded you overtime into exactly she what she wants and rather than consider being a true partner to you, she's desperate for that to never change.Given that narrative, my heart aches that you remain in the thick of it. Again, I get that you are exhausted from the past two years and have just started to get some peace, mental rest and the beginning of healing which is a day at a time process however, as you stay focused on this peace and start to genuinely recover I suggest you think long and hard about how you want to feel about your life's trajectory when you are close to death's door.This may come off a bit dark but the reason I ask this is important. **At the end do you want to look back at your life filled with regret? That you never fought for and in the end chose a "path of less resistance" to placate others rather than choosing and going for what you want, what makes you happy?I can tell you want to be loved and cherished by someone who truly wants to give it back in the same way. Or maybe you want to be single and travel, or maybe it doesn't matter really about the what at all, just that you want to be able to make those kinds of decisions again!And yet everything you list as reasons to your present being the way it is stands in your way from that. I asked you to assess how you would feel at the end if this stayed the same till then for a reason, because none of this will matter in that point in time: your wife's opinion, behavior, the fights, the stress, your culture, your marriage... None of it.You'll be stuck with the pain of knowing you could have risked some temporary hardship and strain with your family to live how you want, but you didn't so whom and what did you live for?I'm sorry if this sounds harsh but it's not my intent here. It's to make you seriously and critically consider, reflect and assess what is more important for YOU and what YOU NEED to be happy.Because IMO with what you've already been through, there is nothing in your way right now that even remotely stacks up in value against what it is you truly deserve: to be and live exactly how you want.
hwf9p2,Thank you. This struck close. I definitely need to evaluate my life ahead and maybe get some therapy as well. I've been under immense stress that's taken a lot out of me. Broken me.
hwf9p2,While I guess it's good that you've found some peace with your life, I worry that it's unsustainable.  Caring about someone doesn't mean you have to put their own needs above your own, so I'd encourage you to figure out what will make you the happiest.  If divorce isn't an option where you live, would moving to a more liberal area help?  Can you help your wife become self sufficient, or at least able to survive on alimony, so you can part ways without feeling guilty?  If she's still your best friend and you want to stay with her out of desire not resigned obligation, what about an open relationship to get your need for sexual intimacy met?  There have to be other options beyond "I've been beaten down enough to be okay with this" - with Covid there is an increase of telehealth options so perhaps you can find a therapist to help you sort through everything and set you on a path where you can be excited about the future instead of depressed about it.
hwf9p2,Moving countries isn't really an option, more so in the current world climate. As for support, I think I worded it wrong. She's emotionally dependent, finances aren't a big concern. I'm a very independent person, she is the exact opposite. Needs someone to lean on... Which isn't a problem per se. And I'm still there. It's just mentally, I don't think of her as anything other than a friend/family now.And yeah, as you'd have guessed it.. there's really no concept of an open relationship here. My options are pretty limited. Let me put it like this, I'd get laughed at by family if I cited lack of intimacy as a reason for divorce.
krmrtm,My father was adopted, and died in 2000 (I'm 25). I am currently trying to find his bio family, which turns out is super complicated, I even took 2 years to learn another language in order to be able to find them across borders. I'm telling you this so you know that I 100% understand what you mean and why you want to get to know your fathers family.At the same time, I don't get good vibes from what your mother has told you so far. Maybe it would be a good idea to get the whole story from her, why she had to get away and in which way they are/were violent. I also agree with her that you should let her know before getting in touch with them. You may underestimate what you are getting yourself into if you don't have the full picture.Also, the fear of rejection is very real and it is indeed possible that they don't want anything to do with you. Again, I can give you my perspective, but how YOU handle this is up to you. For me, looking for my bio family is something I do because I want to know where I come from. I want to know the entirety of my dad's story and if I am not welcome in his bio family, that's it, at least I know. He won't come back to life if I find them, and he won't die again if I don't. There's no way of replacing him or the relationship we could have had, had he lived. I didn't have his bio family in my life until now, so I'll live if they don't want me in their lives when I find them. I'll still have my mom, my half siblings + nieces/nephew and my friends. I have had a wonderful set of grandparents and a mom who filled the role of mom & dad as best she could, and I don't need anymore in my life. I want more, I want a relationship with my bio family, but I dont need it.Just some perspective... I hope all goes well for you, and you make the decision you feel most comfortable with.
krmrtm,I agree with this - especially to tell your mother first. She sounds like she was trying to protect both you and her when she went no contact. There could be a back lash at your mother too. She might also point you to some of the family members that may be a bit more accepting if you reach out.
krmrtm,Okay, being totally honest, if you don‚Äôt think you could cope with them rejecting you, do not reach out to them.Because right now, in your imagination, the ‚Äúworst case scenario‚Äù is that you reach out and your family rejects you. That is not the worst thing that could happen. Especially not if your mother is literally telling you that she wants to know if you reach out so she can protect you. Even if only some members of the extended family could be dangerous, you don‚Äôt get to pick-and-choose which parts of a family you start interacting with. If you open that can of worms there is no going back. Those people know you exist, and if any of them are malicious or predatory that means you are permanently on their radar as a potential target. Honestly? You‚Äôd probably be more at risk since predators tend to be very skilled at choosing targets, and you coming into the family as the ‚Äúestranged cousin who wants to connect‚Äù would make you look like a perfect victim.Your father‚Äôs family is apparently so something that your mother didn‚Äôt even check on them‚Äîshe wanted so much space she literally didn‚Äôt know he had died until a decade after it happened. And the fact that your mother hasn‚Äôt demonized them to you, and has instead just kept the information to herself and offered to tell you for your safety now that you‚Äôre an adult, really really strongly indicates that your father‚Äôs family probably has some nasty people in it. You seem to still be approaching this idea with youthful hopes of finding a loving family and being even happier with them in your life. Tragically, that is not typically how these sorts of ‚Äúreunions‚Äù go. Everyone I know who has been in a similar situation has been really let down by their bio family. Remember! Everything you know about these people is from Facebook. It is the easiest and most common thing in the world for people to manipulate how they present themselves online. Just because a Facebook timeline looks like it‚Äôs all ‚Äúhappy fun family times,‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt mean it couldn‚Äôt actually be ‚Äúscreaming and throwing things at each other‚Äù in real life.At the very least, you must speak to your mother about whatever it is she offered to tell you before. You must do the safe and responsible thing of getting the full story before you reach out to literal strangers.
krmrtm,It‚Äôs really up to you. I‚Äôm 31 and never met my father or anyone from that side of the family and at this point I have no interest. A younger me always wanted to though, never for acceptance but to see if I looked like any of them lol.
krmrtm,I understand you are exited and want to know your dads family, but based on what your mom said I would recommend proceeding with caution. There is a reason your mom left. Try getting the full story from her, and if you still want to reach out then you should.
krmrtm,One of the best short stories I have ever read is two sentences long. "A gift one must not open? Curiously, Pandora opened the box."Your "Italian Family" could be anything from actually super nice to absolutely overbearing, criminal and involved with a Mafia type organization. If your mother felt the need to:not tell your father about her pregnancynot ask him for child support while he was alivenot ask for any inheritance he might have that would likely be passed onto you as his only child,move awaynot say anything positive, but keeping anything negative to herself, except for mentioning two criminal siblings of your late fatherthis clearly indicates there's more going on than you know. And likely more than you would be able to find out from your mom.I would recommend postponing getting in touch with your father's side of the family. You don't know if it's a genuine gift if you did ‚Äì or if you better keep this gift locked like pandora's box. Don't open it until you have a better idea what you may have to expect, and don't open it in the middle of a pandemic. Because if the worst case scenario happens to come true, moving some place else could turn out to be much more difficult than in normal times.
krmrtm,Really, the number one priority is your mum. You want to be honest with her and have her be honest with you. If your dad's family have no interest in getting to know you, you'll still want to have your mum by your side. Let her know what you're thinking and ask for a bit more information about the family and if in your shoes, would she want to get to know them?If they reject you, then that is nothing to do with you at all. You can't reject a person you don't even really know. What can be rejected are feelings of guilt, embarrassment, shock, denial of the truth, being overwhelmed with emotion, grief and regret. These are all things the family might feel and not want to deal with, but it's not you personally. You might be the nicest, best person on earth but if finding out a big secret about their deceased son/brother is too painful then it really is about their feelings and not about you.
krmrtm,I think you may, possibly, be missing a piece of information. My suggestion would be to have the conversation with your mother about why she had to get away from them. You need the whole picture before you make this decision. Once they know about you, you can't take that back, and if there are some bad people in this family...I want you to think about your mom. Something happened to her that she had to bolt in the night with a brand new baby or pregnant, and go no contact with your father's family. She says she wants to protect you, but I want you to think about protecting her. What if something happened to make her need to hide from these people? If they find out about you, they also find out where she is. Please don't take that lightly.
krmrtm,Your mother says thisShe mentioned she had to "get away" and asked if I wanted to know whyAnd you concern is this?All I can think about at the moment is reaching out to them. But then I'm scared that they might reject me.I think you need to be more concerned about getting wrapped up in some really fucked up people.
krmrtm,I think you are really setting yourself up for a huge disappointment. It's  been 19 years since he passed.  His family might not even remember your Mom and their relationship.  Just being related to a cousin doesn't prove anything to strangers.  Even if they do believe you it doesn't mean they will care if you show up on their door.  You are a stranger  to them and those big happy family reunions mostly just happen in movies.  I am sorry, it really sucks that you never got to know your Dad but don't expect much from these people.
krmrtm,I‚Äôm 32 and my birth father doesn‚Äôt know I exist. (Not anybodies fault. She didn‚Äôt know she was pregnant till month 5 and by then he was long gone- hard to track drifters down before the fb era). And I probably won‚Äôt ever meet him.Then again, I had to go through the whole ‚Äòahhh what if they reject me!‚Äô Thing when meeting my Birthmother for the first time too so I do totally get it.Best advice I can give is this: read up on their family (if you can), if they‚Äôre violent you may not want to get involved with them just as a safety thing. If you DO decide to move forward with contact go into it with just the bare minimum in mind: you want family medical history and that‚Äôs all. If you get more, great! If you don‚Äôt, then at least in the future any important medical information can be passed along to your doctor.
krmrtm,By the sounds of it, you father family might be dangerous... be careful.
krmrtm,This is a serious decision. Go talk to a therapist before you do something that could turn out to be a lifelong problem much worse that not taking any action.
krmrtm,I was raised by my father, and knew nothing about my mother until my mid teens. My father remarried a few times during my childhood, and I ended up running away at 15 because of his last wife and her abuse.I looked up my mother a year later.I gained a wonderful (half) sister from it, but honestly, letting a toxic woman into my life who would pretend to have a bond with me when I was in fact a total stranger was terrible for my already fragile mental health.I wouldn‚Äôt recommend getting in touch with these people. It sounds like your mom did the best that she could for you, and I‚Äôd respect her silence and allow her to stand as your family. Build a chosen family of good friends who will love and support you, don‚Äôt go looking for biologically related strangers who will poison your worldview.
krmrtm,If you trust her, I would talk to your mom and get all the details you can from her first. Plenty of seemingly great families have neat secrets like enabling child molestation, drugs, rape, etc that no one talks about, they just know "never to trust Bobby around your wallet / self / kids". If you meet them, you'll want to like and trust them but just being blood doesnt mean you shouldn't be cautious.
krmrtm,I think you should have a sit down with your mum and get the full story, you should go in knowing as much as you can.Personally I can't trust my own mum, I will ask her for her side of things but take it with a pinch of salt.With 23 and me, I found out my dad wasn't my bio dad nearly 2 yrs ago. I also found out o had two bio brothers, one who was 48 at the time of his death a year ago and one who is about 42. I contacted the 42 yr old twice since he's closer to my age amd on Facebook, but he never responded. I took it to mean that the older one would have this attitude now. I wish I'd given him the chance to reject me himself none the less, I think he would have but I'm not sure. The thing is, you can open you're heart and reach out without expectations  at least you won't wonder what if when the chance is gone.
krmrtm,I agree with everyone else that you should talk to your mum and get the full story (no matter how uncomfortable that conversation may be). I don't think you should go into it thinking that its going to be a long lost family fairytale ending. At this point they're all just pictures on a screen to you, but real people are messy and complicated, grief also manifests in a million different ways. However... i also think that if i had a son that died and he had a daughter somewhere out there in the world (especially one who looked like him), i would be desperate to get to know her and overjoyed that a part of him lived on.
jlimwx,Move out on your own. Your parents are responsible for your sister. They will not starve. If you need to, take in your sister or pay her school fees, but you do not need to pay for your lazy father and grandmother.
jlimwx,yes exactly I was feeling so selfish taking a step this extreme but hearing the response I'm finally coming to terms that it's okay to do this
jlimwx,This is what I will do.  Is the parent job to look after their children.
jlimwx,Really hope you will both make it out.
jlimwx,Fellow Indian here, this is messed up. Move out and tell your parents after the fact and remind them that their child (sister is their responsibility). Keep in touch with your sister and ensure your parents don't know. Only step in to get her once you are settled and if your parents are failing her.
jlimwx,Yes will be doing that ASAP. Thanks!
jlimwx,Hey!!!Move out and get your own placeAlso go completely no contact with both your parents after telling them that you are leaving and they will have to provide for your sisterTell your mom that she will have to pay for her kidTell your sister if none of your parents step up you will come get her (min 1-1.5 month)If they don‚Äôt step up then move out with your sister (if your parents threaten with legal action,take them up on it and go to court so that you can get your mother to pay for your sisters expenses )Live your life!!!!
jlimwx,this felt so good even as I read it. Doing this would be a whole new level of serotonin. Sometimes all you need is new perspective and some motivation to just do it. I'm seriously doing this and leaving this shithole. THANK YOU!
jlimwx,This.  All of this.  Your dad is capable of working, he should work.   He still has a child to support (your sister).If you have any aunts or uncles on your dad's side I would also contact them to see if they would take your grandma in.
jlimwx,This exactly.  Your parents chose to be parents and it's their responsibility to take care of your sister.  They shouldn't be putting that on you.
jlimwx,We've explored that option as well but the thing is that her new husband has 3 kids of his own so she's married into a full blown family. She clearly told my father before marrying that she won't be taking our responsibility in anyway anymore so it's not possible. Her husband is a bigger jerk lol can't send my sister there.And definitely gonna keep that in mind because my father was eyeing some money I have in the bank that I earned from my internship. It's a good amount and he was hoping I'll invest it in the property he'll buy.
jlimwx,I'm sorry to hear this. I had a friend once who father died drunk in a bar fight. He ended up at age 16 having to earn money selling drugs so he could pay rent to help his mom pay for his little bro who was like 10 at the time.There are no easy answers esp with family. You love them, but you need to set hard boundaries.This might sound heartless or emotionless or lacking in India's societal values (as I'm american). People are lazy and will go to extremes and say a lot just so they can keep living and doing as little as they can. You have to dictate to them what you are giving them and then they will have to make do, cause that's what they did for your childhood. They dont get choices. You as a child never got the choice of where you want to live or what they did with their money. If they Dont follow your choice, then they get no money. If they continue to break the rules, cut them off for a month. They will come crawling back and only accept them in if they follow your rules. If they continue to break them after, cut them out longer and longer until they learn their lesson or they never learn it.To your dad, I would argue that he has only supported you 23 years so does that mean you will only support him for 23 more years? That he has only provided food, never bought you any property. I would definitely change pins and passwords if your dad knows any of them, as well as keep your computer away from him.To your grandma, shes probably just stuck in a hopeless situation too. I'm sure she has talked to your dad but he thinks he is now head of household and deserves the money you earned. So shes trying to pressure you so she can still live easy. Dont let him, cause he will think he deserves it all. Appeasing him wont help. Give him a little and he will want it all.I'd just start acting like the head of household and make decisions for all of them. Where you are going to live, electricity use, tv time, computer time, what you will eat. Become a tyrant in the house and hopefully your dad will get sick of it and go back to work. You are already paying for everything so its yours. Put it all in your name legally.Just dont compromise your own financial health. They wont be offering you money down the line.
jlimwx,thank you so much for your reply. it makes all the sense in the world. I'll have to take some necessary steps here. Assert my position in the house.
jlimwx,Thank you so much. I will move out and live my life!
jlimwx,her husband and new life. whenever we bring the subject up she says her current husband and his kids won't be open to the idea. She probably made it clear to her husband before marriage that we (me and my sister) are our father's responsibility. Also, that man already has 3 kids to sustain he won't be too keen on paying for my sister's expenses.
jlimwx,Part-time work in India is not an option at all. The dynamics are very different here. Almost every kid's education is funded by their parents up until they get a job after college. Some of my friends are 25 and pursuing PhD and still being funded by their parents. Even if someone was willing to work part time there are zero opportunities. I worked part time as a home tutor alongside my college and even that was barely enough to sustain my personal expenses like travel and stuff. Paying off college/school fees w part-time is unheard of unless you're like really smart IT person or doing some shady business
jlimwx,There are already good advices here, so I don't have much to add. But I still wanted to give support.You will be able to get out of this, yes it'll be very harsh, but I believe you can.It's absurd how our society's only plan for an individual's education is what their parents provide, we don't even have part time options suitable for students, people in need search so hard and sacrifice for it while I always read about other country teens/adults earning their own money as is the norm there. So we can't even expect your sister to be able to support herself. I know many people do that, but it's harder here, that's what I think. You must hardly be earning much, to support a whole teenager. Move out.. it would be lots of arguments and being called selfish, but you have to, even if for your sister, moving out and then calling her would be better for her than staying here and supporting someone who can earn themselves.Life would not be peaceful financially for a long time. But it would still be worth it. When you have a place of your own, explain the situation to your sister in details, so she could set financially affordable college goals and plans for herself. Look into scholarships, it's a lot of research, and documentation for us, but maybe something could be found there.I don't really see any way amma could be supported, but the best course is leaving and then your papa would have to step up and earn what he could to provide for her. Worst comes to worst, look into charity old-age homes, because we can't expect everything to go according to plan, I understand she's not your responsibility, but with how our society is and how we are, we won't be able to just up and leave. (If you are, I would still give you support, but the old-age home option is still what I would kindly insist)All the best, you are strong, I'm near your age and I think about your situation and just feel empowered by what you could do. You will be able to get a hold of the situation, I believe.
jlimwx,Thank you so much for your support! This has been really uplifting. THANKS <3
jlimwx,Honey, all I can say is that your parents decided to have kids to make themselves happy, so while your sister is still under age, they have to provide for her. You didn‚Äôt procreate your sister‚Äîthey did, so they need to be the adults. A lot of parents try to guilt trip their kids by saying that they raised them and stuff, but that is what‚Äôs required of them if they decide to have kids. If they weren‚Äôt prepared to do the work, that‚Äôs their problem, not yours.Go live your life, hon!! Move out, don‚Äôt tell them where you‚Äôre moving, and go no contact with your parents (and any other flying monkeys that they throw at you) ASAP.
jlimwx,Yes ma'am! <3
n9y656,Honestly, cutting ties with toxic people whether or not they're blood is the kindest thing you and your fiance can do for yourselves. There's so much less stress and drama. Your fiance will have your family, and you'll have your friends and each other. It is genuinely enough.
n9y656,Thank you for this perspective... I think this is where my fianc√© leans. We've been together for long enough now that he does think of my family as his family and they treat him and feel like he is their son/grandson/nephew/etc. We have a host of friends who are amazing. He has no shortage of people who love him and support him, and maybe that really is enough
n9y656,I don't even understand why someone would get upset by hearing this fake story, even if it was true? A man proposed to a woman after 2 years of dating when she was only 22, and she said no to the marriage but continued to date him. I would hear that and be like "Okay...sounds like she wasn't ready for marriage then, but is now..."Even if this story was 100% true, I still wouldn't want anything to do with a person who used that as a reason to get upset. It's really none of their business how and when he proposed and how and when you accepted.
n9y656,Best answer right here. Good luck to you and your fiance
n9y656,Can't agree with this more!  Imagine raising kids around this type of environment.
n9y656,It sounds to me like your fianc√©'s mom cooked up this story and your uncle believed it. For some reason, in dysfunctional families everyone believes the lies of the least reliable, most toxic member. The longer their history of lying, the more everyone else believes them. No, it doesn't make any sense.Your fianc√© could send an email to everyone saying uncle is lying, but that's about all you can do. Obviously this will help you decide which relatives are invited to the wedding.
n9y656,I kind of think that's what happened too-- but what doesn't make sense to me is why Uncle wouldn't just outright say that? And instead is insisting that he "saw it on Facebook" and is throwing his kids in as other "witnesses"-- the kids don't even know what he's talking about and say they have no idea where he would have gotten it from.I just find it all super weird and toxic. And find it interesting that this is lie is coming up for the first time now, rather than when we got engaged 3 years ago... or really anytime since then?
n9y656,I‚Äôve seen this pattern and I think it‚Äôs because people desperately want to believe that their most toxic relative has changed or become a better person so they throw themselves behind whatever the toxic person says.
n9y656,I absolutely agree with cutting all ties.
n9y656,Is it at all possible the uncle has some early form of dementia?  I don‚Äôt know these people obviously and it could be a story for the mil but the behavior from the uncle is really bizarre and not knowing anything else is what I would consider
n9y656,I honestly don't know. Maybe? This situation is so bizarre, so I'm not sure if there's a neurological component or if it's a continuation of the toxic behavior that runs rampant in his family.
n9y656,Ya, honestly that was the first thing I thought of too when reading this. That or he saw someone else make a post and mistakenly thought it was from OP's Fianc√©. I've had friends make mistakes like that before when they saw someone with the same first name or a similar profile photo make a post.It could also be the mom, like OP believes. It's a really weird situation.
n9y656,Don't give any further fuel to the crazy the uncle is spewing.  Anyone who knows you, knows it's a lie. Let the crazy train roll on with him and anyone who believes him.  You don't want anyone at your service who is not supportive, and that includes your fiance's kin.  Have a great wedding!!
n9y656,I went NC with my mom about a year ago to date - she wouldn't accpet or respect boundaries, she reufses to even acknowledge the hateful and hurtful things she's said to me and my wife (uh, lady, i have the texts), and has consistently tried to villify my wife ever since i asked her to respect some VERY mino boundaries before we got married.This behavior will not deescalate, these kind of people only get more extreme and intense the more they think it will work. "When you cut the cord, you take away their power"
n9y656,Honestly I would ignore uncle and invite the rest of the family. If they raise the issue explain the truth, but I wouldn't cut contact with anyone except the ones causing problems, which looks like just parents and now uncle?
n9y656,I see two options here: The easy one, and the nice one.The easy one is blocking Uncle and going no contact. The nice one... is a little more work.So, let's get things straight: You don't remember that mishap of a proposal. Your fianc√© doesn't remember it. Your cousins-in-law don't remember it. So, as a result, we all know that what your Uncle-in-law tells people is false.What we don't know is if he is lying or if he believes he's telling the truth. We also don't know if your MIL is behind this, or if it's the Uncle's own doing. You write a lot about your fianc√©'s relationship with his parents, but don't mention any quarrels with his uncle. We can, however, tell from this post that you are a caring young lady and your fianc√© is a nice man.So I would suggest doing what any nice and caring person would do: You get people the help they clearly need. If the Covid-situation where you are permits it, I would suggest you invite the cousins and Uncle over for dinner. After the main course (when no one is hangry anymore), you address the issue: Uncle says he remembers something that clearly didn't happen. As asked by Uncle, you got in touch with cousins, who confirmed they don't remember this either. This made you think hard why your Uncle claims he remembers something that didn't happen. And you came to one conclusion: You haven't had any troubles with Uncle in the past, so you have no reason to believe he would deliberately spread lies and false rumors. Because he clearly isn't a mean person. So he must actually believe what he says. But since no one else remembers that, you are very worried that this could be an early sign for Alzheimer's. You wanted to discuss this privately, with only his children (and wife) present, in a positive atmosphere. Alzheimer can be delayed when treated soon, so would he mind to address this with his doctor? Would he want the support of you or any of his children? Did anyone else notice any signs? Again, you understand how frustrating and painful this must be, but you could not come up with any other conclusion, so you are very worried for Uncle, as you care about and love him a lot.I'm pretty sure holding such an "intervention" will cause Uncle to drop the issue like a hot potato if MIL is behind it.
n9y656,You can use unpleasantness as a litmus test to tell which people in your life are worth spending brain cells on.
n9y656,Well, there might be some good people in the bunch, still. Going no contact with the uncle is a given, but the kids seem alright, for example. I would suggest personal calls to family members to sort this out.
nnye90,She begged me not to tell my husband that I knew, but I told her I could not promise her that.Because what your husband will tell you is probably quite different.They're both very happy lying to you, and just because what she's told you is painful, doens't make it the full truth.
nnye90,That's exactly why i think she doesn't want me tell him. He's either going to say nothing happened, or a lot more happened.....sigh, no idea what to do. But i will tell him.It's just so hard to pretend to be normal right now.
nnye90,You've left out how the marriage has been between 5-6 years ago and the last 6 months. I would consider all of that time in your decision. Because, while you say the affair ended before it ever really began, phone sex and nudes are definitely cheating. And my best friend would never in a million years be involved in anything sexual or romantic with my SO...and I don't know many best friends that would.I personally think that he should know that you know and how it has made you feel, and then speak about how you move forward from this point. How it goes from there depends on how the conversation plays out.
nnye90,For the first 5-6 years, it was ok. I just felt depressed though. He wasn't exciting like he used to be. Everything felt routine and bleh. I lost attraction to him and he was definitely mentally not there.He'd come home from work, barely talk to me. Then go gym and when got back we'd just watch Netflix. Weekends were mostly the same except he'd have to 'catch up' on work so we'd barely spend much time together.For the last 6 months, it's been different. We talk so much more, it's fun again. We go out with friends or on dates every week (well not during the pandemic times but still we had fun at home).
nnye90,I would definitely talk to your husband ASAP and find out what he knows and compare it to what she said. She may have altered things to make herself look better because she wants you back in her life. As for whether to forgive your husband, that's something only you can determine and nobody can really tell you whether you should or should not forgive him. If you do choose to forgive him, that's fine and your choice, but be sure you truly forgive him and move past it. Plenty of relationships move forward after infidelity, but your husband is going to have to put in a lot of work to earn back your trust. Without him knowing, it would be difficult for me to determine whether his "change" was motivated by remorse or guilt.You say you've forgiven your friend, and that's great but I still wouldn't want her back in my life. You can forgive someone and still not want anything to do with them. What kind of friend commits adultery with their friends' husband? If she was lonely, she should have gotten a dog or joined the community theater. If she was depressed, she should have seen a therapist. If she wanted adventure and thrills, she should have tried skydiving. An affair with your best friend's husband is not on the list of things to do to spice up your life for any person with decent morals. She said she only told you now because she and your husband swore to keep it a secret but...that is not a reason for telling you now. Why not before it got to the point of sexting? Why not a month ago? She obviously valued her secret more than she valued your friendship.
nnye90,Yes. She could have went on Tinder.
nnye90,It seems very suspicious that she all of a sudden had to tell you this.  and she likely isn't telling you the whole truth.  i doubt they just had phone sex, they probably did it all.They've both proven you can't trust them, regardless of what all they did actually do.I don't see how you could have her back in your life after what she did. or why you would want to.
nnye90,"Now I called it a semi-affair because it ended before it really started."But it did start. Her trying to justify it by saying she wasn't really attracted to him for the first few dates (?!?!?) reeks of absolute bull, and of trickle truth. I'm sorry.
nnye90,Agreed.They also had sex on the phone , sent nudes and were emotionally attached to each others : it s not a semi affair , this is cheating this is an affair .
nnye90,This has trickle truth written all over it.
nnye90,Thinking the same thing, maybe she was hoping this would take the heat off of her and put it onto husband thus giving her a chance to be friends.But she definitely has to tell her husband, to verify what happened and to make sure everything is transparent and they didn‚Äôt sleep together, I feel like she‚Äôs not telling the whole truth
nnye90,What's trickle truth?
nnye90,No. Do not let her back in your life. If you were so important to her then why would she have an emotional affair with your husband. You can forgive her sure for your own healing.I am not so sure about your husband either. Two people very close to you betrayed you. That 8s traumatic.  I wonder if you have processed all this.
nnye90,I do agree, I am upset and not defending then. My husband had told me many times he needed her to vent and open up because he couldn't do that to me or his friends.
nnye90,What they had is called an emotional affair, not semi-affair.She begged me not to tell my husband that I knew,She told you her own truths. You have to confront your husband and then decide if you want to move on or just leave. Do not let her put her burden on your shoulders. She didn't want your husband to tell you anything, but suddenly she told the whole story herself. I don't believe she is really your friend and I don't understand her motivations but I don't believe she has innocent intentions. If I were you I would stay away from her.
nnye90,I wouldn't describe having phone sex and sending nudes to one another a mere emotional affair. It may have started as an emotional affair but it definitely grew to an affair.I just now that if my partner ever did something like that, our relationship would be over.
nnye90,This is where I‚Äôm stuck. This woman just isn‚Äôt OPs friend. At every stage she‚Äôs hurt husband and OP and made them lie to each other about this? At least by lying by omission? No. This woman needs to be yeeted out of this relationship
nnye90,Agree üíØ, I‚Äôd also add set some boundaries with the husband.
nnye90,Of course tell him! He is your husband. She should have told him to tell you. He wanted to tell you. It is weird  she said it was better for you not to know and then changed her mind, throwing him under the bus. Does she want browny points because she told you first? The fact that she is asking you to keep it from him is fucked up and selfish.. if she really felt bad and cared about you she wouldn't care if he knew she told you. She seems conniving. I wouldn't trust her anymore if I was you. Or your husband for that matter ...and ya it's not normal for married men to meet with a single woman weekly for discussing their marriage
it2bwy,Cut him off. This is the type of person that has no problem hitting on married people and sees cheating as ok. He's going to hitting on your GF/Wife. Also those who knowingly help in Cheating need to face social consequences.
it2bwy,If you are married or in any kind of relationship you should drop him like a hot shit.
it2bwy,"If you are a decent person"...there, fixed it for you.
it2bwy,You seem so far removed from the actual situation that it shouldn‚Äôt be as much of your problem as you‚Äôre making itThat being saidIt‚Äôs the people you choose to be around and your home so as long as you‚Äôre legally in the right, move on ? Maybe you can rekindle your friendship when your values align more
it2bwy,It's his right to feel however he wants you can't judge him for hating his cheater friend. And btw  He doesn't have to rekindle friendship with a person of low moral value.
it2bwy,Wtf are you on about!? It has everything to do with him. From your comment I can only assume you lack any sort of moral decency and enjoy the company of low value turd cutters. Do you not have standards?
it2bwy,I still want to know how he helped someone cheat. I feel like that is really vague and could mean so many things.
it2bwy,When you say helped her cheat what do you mean exactly? Was he the one having sex with her or did he arrange for someone else to do the cheating? What did he do exactly?
it2bwy,Have you talked to him about this? What does he say?He helped this girl cheat and is refusing to take any responsibility for his actions. Makes excuses at every turn.
it2bwy,help woman cheat? like, being affair partner?
it2bwy,(1F) like it's relevant. I love reddit makes me chuckle every time
it2bwy,I mean if the kid was like 6M, come on... par for the course.
it2bwy,What does it mean he helped her cheat? How does that even happen?He doesn‚Äôt owe anything to the girl‚Äôs husband, only she owes him respect and loyalty.
it2bwy,As they say, you are who you hang out with. Someone who is willing to do stuff like this, really isn't someone  I would want to have in my life.Also, posted here because I couldn't post on your update. It's good you let go of this guy.
it2bwy,Its really not your business. Also, that girl was gunna cheat- probably no matter what- so unless your friend was like actively pursuing her while in a relationship, he's definitely not to blame for her infidelity.
it2bwy,it‚Äôs weird to be this mad and upset over something that isn‚Äôt his business. Cut the friend off and move on. ‚ÄúI have to drink to be around him‚Äù. Sounds like OP had a drinking problem to begin with so why blame that shit on his friend? It‚Äôs dramatic as hell and I‚Äôm surprised these people are in their 30s.
it2bwy,You don't need that kind of friend in your life. You guys are not on the same page morally and ethically. He is supporting someone who is cheating on the father of her child while the father works and provides for them. It's just wrong and you should cut him out of your life. You don't need him or her. and expose both of them.
mwyur8,I can tell you from firsthand experience that the best thing to do is SLOW DOWN. Seriously, put yourself in her shoes. If I was a 13-year-old girl, I would not react well to my mother telling me we were moving in with some strange man I hardly knew. You have had a relationship with the daughter for EIGHT WEEKS. That is nothing.I get where your fiancee was coming from, wanting to be sure about you before introducing you to the kids. But now you've gone from 0 to 60. Children don't have control over their lives, they rely on the adults around them. You are introducing a MAJOR change in her life and she has no options to deal with it. It's a lot of pressure for a kid to deal with.She may feel like her mom is choosing a man over her. Or that she's being disloyal to her father if she accepts you. She may be angry that her siblings are okay with you. She may be afraid to leave her own home and come into yours. She may feel guilty because she's standing in the way of her mother's happiness! Really, try to understand what she's going through, and that you're putting additional pressure on her by putting the time limit on of "you have to be okay with this in x months because we're moving in together."If you really sincerely want a good relationship with her, my advice to you would be to hit the brakes on moving in and take the time to get to know her SLOWLY. Take the pressure off. If all goes well, you will be in each other's lives forever. It's worth taking the time to do it right. Otherwise the girl's resentment will never go away, and I wouldn't blame her.
mwyur8,Can also vouch for the above advice from personal experience. I don't have any siblings and my bio dad didn't treat me badly, but everything about going slow and being a major change for a teenager is true.Personally, I can relate to your daughter since I didn't see much of my stepdad until he and my mom were married and I moved in with them and started to get to know him when I was about 13 too. Also, my bio dad had been poisoning the well against the other family, so I know first hand what your daughter must feel like.Now, I'm 21 and in the years that I've known my stepdad he has been a constant positive figure in my life, treated me and my mom with love and kindness, and I call him "Dad" now with mutual plans to be officially adopted by him as an adult child in the future. I'm closer to him than my bio dad with whom I don't have much contact anymore, and I'm a part of his extended family too - the grandparents especially adore me since I'm their oldest grandchild by a large gap. 13yo is definitely not too late to develop familial bonds and affection for a new father figure, so I wish you a lot of luck in the future, OP. You seem like a genuine and sweet person, so I hope everyone gets a happy ending!Edit: Thank you for the gold,kind stranger
mwyur8,I have to admit I was flabbergasted that the mom waited until she was engaged before introducing the kids. Personally, I think you should have a good long engagement, OP, before you tie the knot.
mwyur8,I met my step-dad and two older step-sisters a few weeks before our parents wedding and was expected to live with them when they came back from honeymoon.It was pure hell.OP and his future wife have gone about this all ass-backwards ü§®
mwyur8,All of this, seriously. Empathy for her situation is gonna be the biggest savior of anything in this scenario. Even if part of her is cool with it deep down, or getting there, the ‚Äúpoisoning of the well‚Äù from her bio dad may stand to be something that keeps a wall between you two for some time to come. Some kids never grow out of wanting their parents to be amazing at parenting and suddenly pull a total 180 in their lives, especially if they are receiving varied reinforcement of their parents love and attention as they WANT to receive it. It doesn‚Äôt matter who else is there to love them more and treat them better, the brain isn‚Äôt focusing on that at that age. I‚Äôve seen it throughout mine, my siblings, and my step siblings lives‚Äô, sometimes all you can be for a child is the adult in their life who took care of them and showed them better. You may never get a thank you. It‚Äôs something that potentially comes along when marrying someone who has kids, although every situation is obviously different.
mwyur8,These are really good points. Space, respect, and seeking professional advice‚Äîthat‚Äôs the path forward here.
mwyur8,Yeah I was the kid in this situation (but without the bio dad in the picture). My mom didn‚Äôt really introduce me to my step dad much before they got married and to me it was a whirlwind. It really fucked me being torn from my life, support system, and grandparents and having this essentially stranger be in my life and in charge of me.Y‚Äôall need to slow down and give the kid time to adjust. The younger ones will probably adjust fine but you need to slow down for the eldest because if you‚Äôre not careful that relationship could get fucked beyond repair.
mwyur8,Try to look at things from her perspective. You say she 'for some reason' idolizes her dad. Dude. That's her father, and she is likely not ready to acknowledge that he has failed her. She will, given time. But, speaking from someone who went through this myself, what that means is needing to get over the emotional hurdle of thinking, "Why doesn't he want/love me?" A deadbeat dad always has that sting of rejection and I know as a kid I wasn't ready to deal with that for a long time, which meant I would defend him with all the gusto a 13 year old girl could muster.Then comes you. You're not a new or bonus parent in her eyes. If she's already feeling the sting of rejection from one parent, what she feels from you is that you're taking her mom and now she's getting rejected from BOTH parents. Whether this is true or not is irrelevant, I'm only asking that you see how a child will be processing all this. And though I don't mean to criticize, I kind of disagree when parents only introduce the step-parent at the point of marriage. It makes you a kind of awful surprise and gives no time for adjusting to having you in their lives. Just out of nowhere, "Hey we're keeping him and you're losing your home because we're moving into his!" Another nightmare for a 13 year old who has big emotions that they likely feel they need to deal with on their own, especially if her younger siblings are on board and she's not. It's probably not possible, but I would consider finding a new home as a family. Let the children be involved in the process so it feels like their home and not just them entering your space. Again potentially impossible, but food for thought.All this is speculation, but my point is... be empathetic and patient. She's at a weird age and even under the best of circumstances 13 year olds can be little shits. It comes with the territory. Do NOT force a relationship. Let it come as organically as possible. Ask your wife to make sure she gives her daughter and other children some personal time with just her, so they can see and understand that they're not losing her. Make yourself a bonus.
mwyur8,Also she is the eldest. Mom had two more kids with a man ‚Äòpresumed deceased‚Äô which no one else seems to have picked up.13 year old is dealing with her erratic bio dad. Then her next father figure who was around from toddlerhood if I read it right the next kid is 11 has vanished out of her life too. Not just a break up but presumed deceased? The fuck? That‚Äôs a level of uncertainty and invariably some big trauma and emotions.And now for father figure 3: he has appeared with an ice cream cone and eight weeks later ‚Äòyou will be living in my house. Welcome.‚Äô I‚Äôm presuming that since you only met her recently and she‚Äôs a total stranger to you, the already somewhat inappropriate to discuss with a teen girl that you are infertile has not come up and so she might be expecting a new sibling too? (Or your fertility was discussed along with Ikea wardrobes and oh my god, it‚Äôs even weirder for her knowing your testicular status.)This kid is struggling so much with rejection, abandonment and smothering father figures and a mom who seems to be not really helping her through this especially considering that 13 is a weird age for dads and daughters generally as they start to re-establish new child but not childish boundaries.This is a shit show. It‚Äôs like a textbook how not to blend a family.
mwyur8,You don't do anything to fix this right now other than treat her with respect and ignore hurtful things she says. This is not abnormal behavior for a teenage girl whose mother is engaged to someone she doesn't know yet.
mwyur8,Yep OP is expecting too much from her too soon. He also does not mention if his house they‚Äôre moving too is further away from her friends and school, which can be even more distressing to a teen than getting a new step dad.
mwyur8,This is not abnormal teenage behavior even if OP was a good and present biological father. Some teens can be major assholes.  OP just has to weather the storm.
mwyur8,Seriously this. You can't force anything to happen, treat her right and let her mother deal with any outbursts and things of that nature. It will take a while but sooner or later she'll recognize the problems with bio dad and realize that you aren't the enemy. All you can do is set an example. She's a moody teenager that likely feels betrayed, it's a tough spot but she will grow up and if you're consistent more than likely she'll warm up to you. Just don't push man she's far more likely to push back than anything else.
itqqji,When someone acts that way around you, hiding or scrambling their phone, there‚Äôs something going on. Whether it‚Äôs nothing or not, she still feels the need to hide these from you. If you love her still and want this to work you need to ask her what she is doing. Tell her how it‚Äôs making you feel, remind her this has happened before and that it‚Äôs going back down the same old emotional route.If you do this, prepare yourself mentally for the outcome of it. It could go either one of two ways: she either cuts all contact and remains your wife whilst seeking counselling again, or you call it quits.Personally if that behaviour persists you just can‚Äôt stick around anymore. Although a divorce would be messy I imagine you‚Äôre only 47 and you have time to find someone else who you love and adore, for another 25 years of your life.Just because you‚Äôre older doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs over for you romantically. Know your worth, explain your feelings and if she continues to cross your boundaries you need to find courage to leave.I hope it all works out for you :)
itqqji,‚Äú...Only 47...‚Äù I love to hear that. I still got many years till then but it makes me happy knowing even later in middle age you can still do anything a young adult can. My mom got her PhD in her early 50s!
itqqji,Bingo. I‚Äôve had issues with cheating (myself being the cheater) in the past. I‚Äôm now in a healthy relationship for over a year (almost 30YO female) and I would never cheat on my partner (and never have cheated on this one). I‚Äôve been sensitive about where to draw the line, and although my boyfriend trusts me and doesn‚Äôt read my texts, I‚Äôve always texted as though he could. If I‚Äôm texting someone something, that‚Äôs in the back of my mind - If he ever were to read this in the future, would he be offended? Which isn‚Äôt to say that I don‚Äôt vent about him. But I say fair things when I do so, I talk about MY feelings, and usually I do so with my brother or my close friends. No one that I have had any sort of romantic past with and typically same gender. I think if it‚Äôs something you couldn‚Äôt do in FRONT of your SO, you (your wife) should be questioning yourself.
itqqji,Omg I‚Äôm only 28 and I want out!
itqqji,I would be worried it's the same pattern. Ask her flat out what's going on. Tell her it seems just like 2015. Hopefully she will understand and show you the messages and it's nothing. But I doubt it!
itqqji,If she's willing to show you her chat right then and there, that's good. If she refuses, says she needs time to think about it, or shows you a blank (deleted) history, you have your answer.
itqqji,This is clearly a repeat of 2015. I suspect the "friend from school" is actually the same guy.Demand to see the messages and don't give her an opportunity to delete or hide them. Resume counseling.You've been together a long time. If she's yearning to feel desired, you both need to communicate your needs better and work on your relationship. You sound complacent and she seems restless.
itqqji,this is sound advice, even if it isn‚Äôt the same guy.
itqqji,Deep down you know the answer- you're afraid of what that means.Is it worth forgetting this indecretion, that will probably happen again? She is lacking something in your relationship that she isn't getting (by no means is this your fault). I am sure if take a step back from your relationship and look  at it from an outsider you'll see that both of you are unhappy and the relationship isnt thriving like it was in the 90's. There is no bad guy- it just that you both have grown into new people with different needs.Ending a relationship is so hard and scary- But so worth it.My Ex did this multiple times in our 8 year relationship. eventually I decided I was worthy of true love and so was he.Good luck and best wishes
itqqji,You should confront her there's a huge possiblity it could be a repeat of what was happening before. If you were in your twenty's I would say leave her, because if someone chooses to cheat on you even if it is emotionally it means they aren't satisfied in the relationship or they just can't keep it in their pants and they don't respect you enough. But you've been married for so long I can only assume at that age you have to have more maturity, sit down with her and tell her you want to know what's happening, try couple's counselling and try to fix what's going wrong with the relationship.
itqqji,As someone who‚Äôs only a few years younger than OP, let me chime in and say that while being in your mid-40s seems old to the 20-something set, but aside from kids and an ‚Äúadult‚Äù life, I don‚Äôt feel aged, and not a whole lot different to 10 or 20 years ago. So, I don‚Äôt necessarily believe he should stay just because he‚Äôs ‚Äúolder‚Äù and that leaving is just as valid an option at any age.Based on the fact that she‚Äôs done this before, and they‚Äôre barely having any sex (anymore?) anyway, his wife sounds like she has checked out quite some time ago. If he decides he wants a shot at saving this marriage, she needs to come clean about what‚Äôs been going, and be honest about what she wants, and OP needs to figure out if he really wants to keep dealing with this, or cut her loose and move on with his life, because even being alone beats having to deal with this level of disrespect and lack of caring and other horse shit.
itqqji,She's doing the same thing. You can confront her again or, you can start having fun outside the house and away from her.Go get active with something you enjoy. Leave her at home and enjoy yourself. When she asks why, simply tell her that her and her online boyfriend are having a great time so, you decided to have a great time as well.Plus, go read No More Mr. Nice Guy.
itqqji,I love this because 1. he gets to have a good time and 2. He can make jokes out of it.
itqqji,And if she dont ask, he is exactly where he started. If she asks, he answers, then she will likely be annoyed for a while and then change nothing. He is exactly where he started.I dont think passive aggressivity will solve his problem. It wont solve his insecurity nor clear up things.
itqqji,A red flag the size of a bus...... confront yesterday....
iya8be,Red lights can be used to reflect off hidden cameras. Maybe he put one in your closet and forgot where? Or was seeing if you put one in there?
iya8be,It's seeming more and more likely that he thinks I planted a camera and he was trying to find it. Which is insane. I'm really wondering what he has done that I haven't caught. He is legitamately losing it, like wow. Thanks for commenting. These comments are really helping me process this.
iya8be,Yeah they sell hidden camera detectors now online if there's one it'll scan and pick up on it.... Your welcome.
iya8be,Was the room dark? As others have said red lights are usually only used at night, that's all they're good for. If the light was maybe more purple it could have been a black light, maybe using it to find bodily fluids on your clothes or something.
iya8be,Yes, it was dark in there. Maybe it WAS just a flashlight and he was hoping I wouldn't notice a light, as another commenter suggested, so he left it dark in there??? I just don't know why he had a flashlight (vs just looking at my stuff), he knew I was home. Like, what will a flashlight reveal. Maybe he is spiraling that much that he thinks I'M hiding a camera or something? My head is spinning :( I have been talking to friends all morning, because you all are right, I do need to leave
iya8be,I can't think of anything a red light might be used to find in a closet (I know they used to be used in certain darkrooms for like black and white film). It's possible he fell down a weird internet rabbit hole and it told him that red lights could reveal hidden cameras or something like that.I agree tha tit's concerning and do what you can to GTFO.
iya8be,Maybe, I wouldn't be surprised if he's researching stuff like that. Thank you
iya8be,This seems really creepy, if you can do it yourself or have a friend that can do it for you, change your locks, its a pretty cheap and easy fix for some extra protection. If he's recording you, he might have already made extra copies of your house keys, also look for Spyware on your phone or computer,  and change your passwords asap!!!
iya8be,Good ideas. It's scary because I don't know what that was and how far he's gone.
iya8be,Thats weird af to be honest.  Be careful around him please.
iya8be,Thanks, I definitely will
iya8be,Your bedroom closet? Red lights are for catching hidden cameras? Have you had fights about Cheating? Maybe he thought you installed a camera to catch him. Or, he‚Äôs psycho you broke up with him and is trying to catch you?
iya8be,I have tried to leave him several times, but can never quite leave for good. He has accused me of cheating, and I have suspected him of cheating. No proof or anything, but I am not about to go bugging my house and putting camera's in my closet (of all places??). I suppose he's done the rest of the house when I'm not around. I honestly have a pit in my stomach right now. What am I dealing with
iya8be,Thank you for the suggestion. I was trying to think if where to post and searching "spying" let me to ask espionage subreddit, "snooping" led me here.
iya8be,My guess is he's trying to find evidence of you cheating on him and who the person is.  Maybe he doesn't understand a red flashlight won't work like a black light, maybe he has some other plan...whatever it is get out asap and cut all contact for good.
iya8be,That definitely sounds plausible. Thank you
iya8be,Weird, I would secretly find a place you can stay and don‚Äôt tell anyone location and move out when he is at work, don‚Äôt tell him your plans. Check your car for tracking devices (prob not going to be there but just in case) . Lock your social media down and remove him from anything on your phone that shows your location. Even change your number . Good luck!Edit: and let your work and family/friends know not to talk to him or give details. Write everything weird down so you have a paper trail if you need itEdit: have someone with you when you are packing in case he does have cameras
iya8be,Thank you for the advice!
ih7ocl,You had an agreement, and while it's okay if he wants to renegotiate the agreement, but he has to approach you like an adult and give you reasons and work with you to find solutions.If he's not doing that, I suspect the real issue is that he wants out of the relationship and is creating this as a flashpoint so that he can kick you out without feeling like the bad guy.But before anything else, you need to ask him what's going on. "We had an agreement. What changed?" And if he doesn't answer respectfully and compassionately, well, you know what's going on.
ih7ocl,I agree. Seems like moving in, which can be a lot for someone whose actually in the situation, and not just talking about it. Can be a lot. He probably wants out and knows this is an easy way. Tell him you‚Äôre planning on moving out since you can‚Äôt pay half and see his reaction.
ih7ocl,I agree with this; he wants out of the relationship.  Suddenly irritated, probably met some other girl.
ih7ocl,Was this place your choice or his? You two agreed on an uneven split due to differences in income. Somehow that's not good enough for him. Has his income suddenly dropped or does he suddenly need more money for other things? Would he be willing to move with you to a cheaper place where you can afford half the rent? If he's not willing to pay more than half or move with you to a cheaper place, then he's basically kicking you out. That would be the end of the relationship for me.
ih7ocl,It was his place and he asked to move with him and I said yes. But told him that I can't afford half the rent there. And what I'm paying now is more expensive than what I used to pay for my old apartment.
ih7ocl,I think someone that he‚Äôs friends with has been trash talking the arrangement, maybe calling you a gold digger or something.  That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs been irritable.  He‚Äôs asking you to pay 50/50 because he‚Äôs been convinced that‚Äôs fair.However, if you weren‚Äôt living with him, you would likely be paying less than whatever 50% of this rent is.  That means what he‚Äôs asking you to do is pay money to him for the privilege of dating him.  Yes, completely not fair.Anyway, I agree do what others have said about talking to him.  If it doesn‚Äôt work, then definitely hold the line on what you can afford in concrete ways.  ‚ÄúI can afford to pay only $700 per month as a student for rent, so paying more would be financially irresponsible.  We have two options.  We can both move together into a place that costs $1400 over in <other place> or I can rent a room on my own in <other place> for $700.‚ÄùSee how he reacts and go from there.  I, personally, prefer the method of splitting things where they go with the budget of the lower earner.  That‚Äôs a thing people do.
ih7ocl,That's what came to mind for me. Someone else made him feel embarrassed about the arrangement, so now he's wanting to change it.He won't give her reasons because his reasons are insulting - stuff like "you're using me" or "you're a gold digger".
ih7ocl,This is the most likely reason. When my ex and I moved in together he was a law student living on loans and I had a low paying entry-level job right out of college. We had initially agreed that I would support us, then afterwards he would be able to support us while I went to grad school. It ultimately was just too hard and the strain got to be just too much. We talked, mostly calmly (got emotional, not angry or yelling), and found a split that would work for us.But all throughout this, people who knew very little were telling me he was taking advantage of me. He was mooching. He wasn't pulling his weight, etc. People see someone paying more and assume it's because they're being used. Relationships are complex and open communication makes all the difference. But it has to be two way! You can't make someone communicate, they have to want to.
ih7ocl,"Look, I don't know what's caused you to suddenly be unhappy with the arrangement we'd talked about, but if you want to change it, I can understand that. But as we discussed initially, I can't afford to pay half the rent. My old place was cheaper than the amount I'm already contributing now to rent here, so what you're really asking is for me to move back out and find my own place again, and I really think I at least deserve an explanation as to what changed to make you suddenly feel so differently and strongly about this."
ih7ocl,If he's deviating suddenly from what you agreed on before you moved in then yeah, I'd say that's unfair especially given your situation of going back to school. I'd really try to figure out why the sudden change from him.
ih7ocl,I don't think you are being unreasonable. Have you asked him why he changed his mind?
ih7ocl,Perhaps he‚Äôs struggling himself with paying his share of the rent .. which is why he re approaching the agreement? Money problems often times cause people to become irritable. Communicate with your bf as to why the sudden change and  what the other options there are even if that means you having to move out.. if your not secure to think your relationship wouldn‚Äôt make If y‚Äôall we living separately then maybe communicate on that aspect too.
ih7ocl,Sounds like he wants out of the relationship.
ih7ocl,I agree with another comment of others talking crap about you making it seem your a gold digger and so forth. Seems abit random but I‚Äôd sit down and be calm and just ask him what‚Äôs going on?
ih7ocl,I believe your boyfriend needs to honor the original agreement. Typically a lease would be for 1 year, and it seems you could say you are half way through your original agreement.With that being said, it might be difficult for you to fight him on this, especially if your name is not on anything in the apartment. Communication is absolutely key here. He may be struggling financially, he may feel himself, or have been told by friends, that you are unfairly taking advantage of him. Whatever the case may be, you need to discuss WHY his mind has suddenly changed.In the end you have two choices:Spend more money to live with himPut in the hard and stressful work, and move out (which would put him in an even worse financial position)If you want my honest advice for moving forward in your life when it comes to splitting costs in a relationship I will say this; consistent bills should always be split 50/50 -  these are rent/mortgage, utilities, and items needed to upkeep a comfortable and clean home. When it comes to additional expenses like eating out, going to a concert, gasoline to visit friends and family, I say that's where the person making more money can spend more because many of those are luxuries which someone making less would not indulge in.Remember when you are dating someone older and want them to pay more for even basic items, you are forgetting that (especially in your 20's) they were going through the same stage just a few years earlier, and may be making more money now, but so will you in just a few years.Once a marriage or solid union occurs, you can start to look at expenses as coming out of a combined pocket because you are a solid couple.Good luck!
ih7ocl,He decides to change the terms of agreement without any reason. I doubt you want to be with someone who can't even keep his word even knowing you can't the rent in the first place.
ih7ocl,Sounds to me like it‚Äôs about more than just the money.
ih7ocl,Maybe not.  For example if she‚Äôs paying less because she can‚Äôt afford more rent but she making a lot of other frivolous purchases, I can see why the rent amount would be back up for discussion.  Just a thought.
k05640,Someone else has said something similar: if you are going to leave the friendship group anyway then might as well burn that bridge and lighten the guilt you feel by association. I would bow out from the friendship group by letting them know this is no longer for me. Then I would contact Amy and ask to speak to her in person and honestly I would just tell her. She will either listen and believe or she will be angry with you for shining the light on something she probably already knows to an extent but unwilling to face.I have had to make the choice to tell a girlfriend, who at the time I did not know very well but I thought was a lovely person and I was hoping to build a friendship with, that I saw her fiancee on a dating site (he also hit on me in person on a few occasion which made my stomach turn). I was afraid that if I tell her the truth she may just end the friendship with me. So, I actually had way more to lose in that situation than you are right now. I told her and showed her proof, I was nervous, she was heartbroken, we both had a little cry. She ended up leaving him shortly, she is now in a loving relationship with two absolutely adorable kids and a man that loves and cherishes her. We are still close although living opposite sides of the country a bit more difficult to keep in touch.There is nothing wrong with either burning bridges (sometimes you gotta nuke those f*ckers into oblivion, just so you are never tempted to walk them again!), or NOT  "minding your own business" (which I find such a callous and selfish way of looking at the world and people in it).Update us if and when you made a decision and acted on it.
k05640,We are all our brother's keeper. It's okay to mind your own business to protect yourself or important relationships, but there comes a point where you just have to be self-righteous and do the right thing.This group of friends sounds pretty unbearable, and I can only imagine what OP's girlfriend thinks about the situation. Making a statement that you can't be friends with a guy like that, telling his girlfriend the truth, and then moving on to greener and more mature pastures is the best option available right now.
k05640,I was best friends with a 25m and he was dating a 28f for what is now 6 years. I can honestly say that I couldn‚Äôt go out front and say ‚Äúhey you‚Äôve wasted 6 years of your life because he‚Äôs sleeping with everyone under your nose‚Äù but it didn‚Äôt really matter. She really didn‚Äôt care to hear that he was gaslighting and using her for a home because she didn‚Äôt want to lose him. I think she even thought that she could change him, as he was snorting drugs in his basement.It all depends on what you think will help the people of this situation. I chose to stay out of it for too long and now that girl will forever be with a man who would call her stupid & ugly to his friends but the opposite to her face. My advice is just act in a way that you feel is best for everybody - but understand the consequences if she believes you.
k05640,Sounds very similar to my situation I'm sorry you went through that. I think my group is a ticking time bomb so I'm inclined to walk away. I have alot of responsibilities outside of this, so it's a heavy burden to keep carrying. Thanks alot for the response its appreciated.
k05640,Please tell her the whole truth - this story sounds eerily similar to what my boyfriend (now ex) of five years did to me recently. And you know how I found out? His buddy. He caught wind that we were about to move in together and couldn‚Äôt stand by and watch me start a life with a cheater. It hurt like hell finding out everything he did, but I‚Äôd take the pain over living a lie. Of course my ex denied it at first, and in all honesty, I almost believed him. But texts and photos don‚Äôt lie, and if the amount of girls he slept with is as high as you say, it really shouldn‚Äôt be hard to gather up enough evidence.Again, please tell her. Even if she doesn‚Äôt believe you, she deserves to know the truth. I was equally hurt over the fact that everyone around us knew the extent of his cheating and no one told me. But I also understand why no one came forward sooner - no one wanted to throw their boy under the bus.  It‚Äôs a tough situation, and even if she decides to stay with him, at least she‚Äôs going into this marriage knowing the truth.
k05640,I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you - but glad that you got out. Does your ex know that it was his friend that spilled the beans? Are they still friends to this day?
k05640,Do I just tell her straight and nuke the whole thing?yep
k05640,If I was the gf I would REALLY appreciate that honesty before I would marry such a pos. If she finds out after the wedding it will hurt so much more.
k05640,You've sent her messages before, she knows he cheats, do you really think she doesn't know who he is?
k05640,Some idea yes. But the full extent? No. Should I just proceed as if it's normal?
k05640,I disagree with all the people saying she knows etc. Its easy for some people to forgive one episode of cheating and ignore anonymous messages , if the guy is as manipulative  as you say he can easily explain those away and beg her forgiveness for the one time he was cheating. However I seriously doubt she knows he goes out sucking on girls tits, bragging to his friends and sending them nude pictures of his conquests! That sounds a whole lot different to just a one time cheater. However if he really has changed then it might be a bit unfair. But, speaking from the perspective  of a female who has been in the situation of forgiving my ex for  sexting with a girl only to find out AFTER I dumped him that others in my circle knew he was doing much worse, I feel like a fool for forgiving him  and wish they had told me sooner. If you dont plan on keeping these ppl in your life as friends I'd tell her. If she doesnt believe you that's on her but your consience is clear.
k05640,I would tell her. She deserves to know. As someone, who had been in a similar situation as this girl, I would appreciate if someone actually told me and I stopped wasting my life.
k05640,The only reason not to say anything is to keep the peace. Keep your nose out of their relationship and let her make her own mistakes because you don't want to risk losing a friend.My other friendship group just say cut them all offBut it sounds like you're going to end the friendship over this. If that's the case, and you can handle the drama, drop that dime. You're going to lose a friend anyways, might as well wreck up the place on your way out. You'll probably feel better about it.
k05640,Your tone is comical but theres some advice in there so thanks. It's not "because" of what my other friends said that I was considering leaving the group. It's that I don't want to be around people playing 'roles' in friendship settings that should be enjoyable and not forced. You simply become a part of the illusion if the status quo is maintained. Others see it differently - like you ought to put up with the lies of another for the sake of the group bond. But how big a lie?  The result is the individual/victim (however you want to frame it) who you're being friendly with in the group is of no consequence. And its for the sake of the group and the cheater's happiness. In this scenario the cheater is no longer someone I consider a friend btw. That's why I'm asking here. Anyway I'm leaning towards a peaceful exit from it all. And what that's what your post is advising right?
k05640,If you tell her (which I think you should), be prepared for the following:That friendship and that friendship group will implode with drama; be ready to block numbers and walk away.Come with evidence -- she has a lot invested, and won't take you at your word. Any evidence at all will help.Be prepared for her to ignore you and make excuses. Sunk cost fallacy. Your goal is just to inform her; acknowledge that what she does with the info is out of your hands.
k05640,This is great. Straight to the point. Thankyou
k05640,Do I just tell her straight and nuke the whole thing?Absolutely. Protect your friend. And why is this a person you associate with?
nldn80,If you were in her position, would you want to be the last to know? It's going to hurt her a lot, but it's going to save her from much worse. Tell her. That's my vote.
nldn80,Came here to say this exact same thing. Nothing is shittier than feeling like you aren‚Äôt enough for your person. Imagine how long this would go on for if nobody came forward (assuming there probably are other women)
nldn80,I would tell her and try to say something specific so she knows you‚Äôre not lying if you can. Like where exactly he was when you met him or something like that.Edit: To clarify what I mean. It would be fine to just tell her. But I know some people are so delusional (or sadly, gaslit) that they just cannot believe something even if it‚Äôs obvious. So it‚Äôd just help her out more if you had some evidence you can mention, especially if you‚Äôre doing it anonymously.
nldn80,Oooh that's tough because we didn't really spend time getting to know eachother, and we were at a very popular bar. I could send screenshots of him asking for my address and telling me he's on his way. But screenshots could be faked. It would come down to my word against his, but I will still tell her
nldn80,I definitely think you should message her. Wouldn‚Äôt you want to know if your partner was cheating on you? I think there is always a moral obligation to tell the aggrieved partner.But yes, use a fake account, send screenshots, and don‚Äôt be surprised if she doesn‚Äôt have the strength to leave him. Being in a relationship with someone who abuses or cheats can take a serious toll on a person‚Äôs self esteem and they start to feel like they deserve it or become terrified of losing their partner. It is still helpful of you to give her evidence that she can use as leverage in her relationship.
nldn80,Tell her but from an alt account..You don't know how people may react so better to hide ur Identity.
nldn80,I want to. The only thing holding me back is that giving her specific details like a screenshot of our convo would immediately reveal that it was me. And he knows my address
nldn80,I'd definitely use a burner account and maybe leave a time gap (a few months) so that he doesn't figure out that it's you immediately.His girlfriend would appreciate a stranger conveying this to her. If she presses for more evidence, give it to her.
nldn80,I was thinking of leaving a time gap too. It's been over 2 weeks now and considering he was out on Saturday and messaging me, I think its safe to assume hes slept with another girl since I last saw him
nldn80,I found out a guy who was casually dating me and begging me to be serious... Had 3 other women on the line.I reached out to all of them and let them know. We are friends now and he's only got one left and she knows she was his last choice.End of the day it was her choice to stay but definitely let that gal know.
nldn80,I have 100% been in this situation because of freaking facebook. It's creepy but I messaged the girl. They had just gotten married. I saw the FB profile pic with a girl in his lap in a white dress and was like omg, gross.Just message her the screen shot of his message to you with his number, see if u can get him to admit to sleeping with u.And say hey, I dont wanna blow up you life but facebook suggested you bf as a friend after I got his number this past weekend. We slept together. I didnt know he was in a relationship. I dont know if it's an open relationship but I'd want someone to tell me if it wasnt.Definitely do not message from a fake account. It makes u look fake
nldn80,Yes, tell her. My motto is to always do  for someone else what I wish someone would do for me...I'd definitely hope someone would tell me, so I'm not sitting there looking stupid. I wouldn't want someone else sitting there looking stupid either.
nldn80,He was surprised when I asked him to use a condom. He said "how cute, you're so careful"I know this is closing the barn door after the horse has bolted, but this should've been a night-ending reaction. The man point blank told you that his default is risky sex.Don't ask him what's going on, it's clear what's going on. He has a long term girlfriend and picks other women up to have risky sex with them immediately. He isn't worth talking to.
nldn80,Oh I have not spoken to him after he left my house and have absolutely no intention of talking to him again. And yes it should have been a deal breaker then and there
nldn80,Tell her. That ain‚Äôt right. Switch places with the girl if you need to.
nldn80,It's up to you. In the end of the day, it's not your responsibility, to manage someone else's relationship, and you are guilty of nothing. But the girlfriend probably would want to know, so you could do that too. Either way, I wouldn't talk to the guy again, if I was you. On the other hand, you still aren't responsible for what he does, cheat or no. So even if you had sex with him again, he's the guilty party, not you.These situations are tricky. Best of luck deciding.
nldn80,Absolutely tell her. He‚Äôs likely to give that poor woman an STD
nldn80,You're so right. I've never done this before, it's literally the first time I've ever had a one night stand and I end up in this situation üôÉ thank you for the advice, I certainly won't do it again
nldn80,UGH. Two options, you can tell her or tell him that you know. Tell her BUT ask if she wants to know  and will keep it secret for obvious reasons, and for sure don't implicate yourself. He has your number, your address so you really don't want to put yourself in danger either. If you're mostly hurt that you've been played, then call his bluff. Tell him you know he's in a relationship and you find him gross. See what he says if he freaks out or blocks you.  And if you really wanted to get some proof, keep texting him. Say you've had fun and you like him. Try to ask if he's single/imply you'd date him etc. Or ask something about him, his life. This way you will have a lot more proof than just one text.
nldn80,I'm worried that getting too involved would cause unnecessary drama.OP isn't part of their lives, and their relationship isn't her concern as such. I think that it's fair enough to let the gf know, but not get too invested. Getting stuck into a messaging mess can even look like she's trying to break their relationship to get him to herself. That would make it too easy for him to spin it as if OP were some crazy stalker. Proof of burden is on him, not OP. Simply stating what happened, when and giving the phone nr to the gf should suffice, methinks.Poop. Now I am invested, and want to know what happens.
ixwt1j,Idk dude, I see people saying this could be normal, but him getting a portrait, offering to adopt her daughter, and contacting her parents is WAY too much. That isn‚Äôt normal, sorry.
ixwt1j,I mean.. is it HIS kid? If so, then it makes perfect sense. This is all kinds of fucked.And where is this painting going? Above the mantle?
ixwt1j,I was ready to defend him and say men can go through grief etc..but him offering to adopt her kid and commissioning a portrait is what puts it into weird territory....
ixwt1j,Agreed. That's where it went off the rails for me too. That's way too over the line for my tastes.
ixwt1j,..... that's something you do for a wife ( or less frequently family members like mom, dad or sister but still really weird when they were co-workers)
ixwt1j,Wow the people in these comments are being way too forgiving. This is your husband and he literally has talked about adopting another woman's child without your consent. WTF. You need to talk to him and figure out what's going on. Regardless of the grief, the things that he has done are not ok. You are his wife and he is not being respectful of you or your partnership and has crossed so many lines. It's unacceptable. You've got two separate issues to deal with here. Start with the red flags and then move on to the grief portion.
ixwt1j,Right?? Everyone is like "yeah, maybe offering to adopt her kid is a little excessive but we all process grief differently!"Nah, this whole thing is fucking weird. This married man screamed in grief when his "co-worker" died, and now he wants her kid, wants a portrait of her, and wants something physical to "remember her by". The fact that he was in love with her is as clear as day. OP, I'm sorry. It sucks to see the man you love grieving so badly, but I imagine it's even harder to see him grieving the loss of the other woman.
ixwt1j,The portrait, adoption, and reaching out to her parents are all super weird.. we all process grief and emotions differently but it might be worth while discussing it with him (don‚Äôt phrase it like this this is just a gist)‚ÄúHey no offence but commissioning a portrait, offering to adopt her daughter who you probably weren‚Äôt that close to, and then bothering her parents for an item are all pretty weird for a work friend. How about counseling so you can process your grief in a productive way?‚Äù
ixwt1j,This is the right answer. Maybe he did have a close relationship with her. Maybe they were more than friends. But, this may not be the right time to bring up infidelity. It's also hard to say how this will impact their marriage in the long run. Maybe he will appreciate married life more. Maybe he will regret staying in the (possibly) loveless marriage instead of spending more time with her and want out.What we can say is that he isn't processing the grief in a healthy manner (he's making decisions that have upset or will upset other people in his life and the coworkers' life). He needs some help dealing with this.
ixwt1j,I think I have read a post like this before. I can't remember the specifics of that post but the update of that post was the husband was in love with the woman who passed away, and it was a wake up call to the both husband and wife that their marriage was a sham.
ixwt1j,Yes, I recall that one too. Actually there was another where it was two men involved and the husband had no idea he‚Äôd really fallen in love with his male best friend. I don‚Äôt remember if the marriage ended after that or not.
ixwt1j,You can have feelings and even crushes on friends without it being infedelity. It sounds like he chose you but still wanted to maintain a close friendship with her, which in my personal opinion isn't damning.As for his quite extreme reaction to her death, I'd say the offer to adopt and the portrait are excessive for sure, but the total grief/screaming/crying/inability to function aren't necessarily indicative of him being in love with her. You mentioned his brother passing 3 years ago, so I'd like to offer this potential perspective:My brother in law passed away 8 years ago. We were quite close. He was only 29. His death broke me for about 3  weeks. The age as well as knowing he had 3 kids absolutely made it so much worse. Despite this, I was able to get stable and recover.That is, until the next few funerals for other people. Some I was close with, others not as much. I attended 5 funerals in 6 years, and I realized at funeral #2 that I wasn't mourning dead person #2. I was mourning them and my brother in law all over again.And then again. And again. The deaths stacked up, and every death was one to the mental pile. I thought of all of them at every funeral, and as a result, the last one I attended- a 23 year old co-worker- I was a fucking WRECK.Your husband needs grief counseling for both deaths. Regardless of if he was in love with her or not, he was very close to her and there's a decent chance that he expected to live at least the next 10 years of his life with her (and any other friends) to be there for the ride. Part of the healing process is coming to terms that you can trust that your friends won't die on you and let go of that fear. When it happens again, that trust gets ripped right back out again.
ixwt1j,I think this is a potential explanation for what happened. Some of OPs husband‚Äôs reactions seem over the top, but I can share a similar story to yours. I lost a sibling to cancer when we were kids. 30 years later, my child‚Äôs teacher lost her own child (same age and gender as my sibling) to the same kind of cancer. I had never met her child. When I heard the news and tried to express my condolences, I lost my composure and looked a complete fool to this teacher. Later, via email, I tried to explain myself, and the teacher completely understood, having had similar experiences herself. Grief is weird. It is with you some days much more than others, and sometimes when you think that life is good and all is well, it will come out of the blue and slam you in the chest. To OP, all I can say is that perhaps you can be an ear to your spouse, and let him use you as a sounding board as he processes this loss. Maybe an opportunity will arise for you to ask your questions during this time. If not, therapy is always a good option. Good luck to you.
ixwt1j,Damn. Very well put and written. Never thought of grief stacking up before.
i157f9,The general rule with flaky friends is to never consider your plans a commitment. If you make plans with him and another option comes along, just text him that your plans aren‚Äôt going to work after all, but you‚Äôll get together some other time. He obviously lives his life this way so he should expect it in return. Also if you continue to make plans with him and no other options come up, you should meet at a place where you would normally go alone anyway, like a store you like to browse, coffee shop, etc. That way you have other stuff you can do than just sit and anxiously wait and you‚Äôre not wasting your own time.
i157f9,Yeah, I just don't have flaky friends.  I accepted it from him because he kept pulling the mental health card.won't be speaking to him again.
i157f9,It's so shitty that he used poor mental health as a cover up excuse. It's really real for a lot of us üò≠
i157f9,exactly!  I even read up on anxiety and stuff to better support him.  I'm a moron!
i157f9,Considering I have an acute case of depression, my SO has anxiety, and many friends of ours have that or mania, it pisses me off that people use that as an excuse when it's demons we deal with daily, it's not to be romanticized.
i157f9,Sounds like a shitty friend that you should cut out of your life
i157f9,totally agree and that's what i've done.  he's dead to me.
i157f9,I have a poor mental health and it is really hard for me to go out and meet people, so I appreciate so much that you accepted it and tried to understand what he's going through. But it also pisses me off that he uses this type of things as an excuse. He doesn't seem like a good person for you
i157f9,honestly I now think he's an objectively bad person.  Who does that to someone who likes them and is kind to them?  like even if he didn't like me at all, surely he should have the decency to tell me
i157f9,our country has a 'gathering' limit of 2 people.  I found out because of the pandemic, but the pandemic didn't make him behave this way.He's an asshole and I just gave him the benefit of the doubt too often.
i157f9,Just block him and stop wasting your time.
i157f9,done :)
i157f9,i know :) but I won't be there.  Now that i know for sure that he's been lying to me, I won't believe him again. Trust is gone.
i157f9,exactly.  I'm over it.  My other friends are amazing, wonderful and loyal people.  He's dead to me.
i157f9,So sorry that you had such a crappy person in your life, but don't stress about it, view it like at least now you see the type of person he truly is, and there is no more need to waste your time/energy with him. Learn from this experience the type of 'friend' you don't need in your life. People just suck sometimes, but watch he'll come crawling back when he needs a Real friend not just someone to hang with.
i157f9,exactly.  I won't know though, he's out of my life.
i157f9,I agree with the others. Just block him. Replace him with real friends.
i157f9,yep, done and dusted
i2ymiq,I think you're overthinking it. You've been involved for 7-8 months. That's plenty of time to fall in love with someone, even if you're not seeing them in person for some of it. Sex is extremely intimate, and it's natural to be overwhelmed with emotion afterwards. Don't address it, just leave it be and let him say it when he's ready.If an almost 40-year-old man is scared off by you saying I love you after talking every day for the better part of a year, you're better off anyway.
i2ymiq,Thanks for the response.  you're right, I never thought about the timeframe. I Was just focused on the fact I said it after having sex with him for the first time. I definately haven't scared him off anyway üòÅ
i2ymiq,You're good I think. Post sex things happen, what I wouldn't do is pressure him one way or another on this.
i2ymiq,Thanks for the response. I'm just going to leave it unless he brings it up. He's not acting weird or anything so it's all good üòÅ
i2ymiq,Reading this made me smile, it sounds like you guys have a beautiful budding relationship! I understand your anxiety and feeling like you may have jumped the gun with saying I love you. However, I think the fact that he wanted you to meet his children as his partner is a clear signal that he is also serious about this relationship! A lot of people have hang ups with saying I love you for the first time, it can feel like a big step to some! But, I really don‚Äôt think this would scare him off, even if it scared him a bit in the moment. In terms of addressing it, I would probably give it some time and see if things feel awkward at all when you spend time together. If you do decide to address it, I would be direct but try not to add more pressure! Something like ‚ÄúI said that because I care for you and seeing you with your children helped me see another deep side of you, and It is okay if you‚Äôre not ready to say that too and if that feels like too big of a step right now.‚Äù Best of luck !
i2ymiq,Thanks for the response. In hindsight he wasn't awkward at all this morning, would have gone for round 4 when we woke up but the sounds of "Daddy" being called through the house meant he had to get up. But I did get a coffee In bed üòÅ
i2ymiq,You‚Äôre overthinking it. He was probably just surprised and I would imagine being a widow may complicate the process of falling in love again on his end. It‚Äôs probably difficult in some ways. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too early, and I would just leave it alone and see how things go from here. Don‚Äôt be upset if he doesn‚Äôt say it back soon, he‚Äôs probably just processing. It sounds like you have a lovey relationship!
i2ymiq,Thanks for the response. In hindsight he's not been weird at all about it. Was a lovely morning too before I left for home. And had some sweet texts through the day. I'm definately over thinking things.
i2ymiq,I second this. If anything, it's too early to freak out about it üòõ
i2ymiq,I dont think this was too soon, just maybe he wasnt ready to say it back. His reaction was positive which is good, he didnt shut down or anything. Just dont pressure him and give him time to say it on his own. You two sound like a wonderful couple.
i2ymiq,Thank you for the response. He just makes me feel so comfortable and happy, I waited 8 months for sex, I'm sure I can wait longer to hear him say I love you!
i2ymiq,I don‚Äôt think you need to worry at all. Clearly he is serious about you since he introduced you to his children. You‚Äôve already done the best thing in that situation which is not freak out once he didn‚Äôt say it back (or take it back yikes). I don‚Äôt think you even need to address it, just wait and when he‚Äôs ready to say it back he will (bonus, he won‚Äôt have to worry about you not saying it back lol). Unless things get awkward, then let him know you don‚Äôt want to pressure him and he can say it when he‚Äôs ready. But honestly, you‚Äôve been involved a while, you‚Äôre adults, he should not freak out over this.
i2ymiq,Thanks for the response. 100% right, in hindsight I don't think he's freaking out at all lol
i2ymiq,As a man, if a woman I have being for as long as you said told me 'I love you' after sex, my heart would melt and I'd be at a loss for words. You're fine, be glad that you found such a wonderful man.
i2ymiq,Thank you for your response. It's good to get the other sides opinion. üòÄ
i2ymiq,Thank you for your response. Hopefully will be long haul, feels like it at the moment üòÅ
i2ymiq,Thank you for your response. He was pretty cute with his pet cats too (not quite baby talk, but still actually talking to them like they are human üòÇ) I work with children (obviously) but never imagined something like that would turn me rampant! I mean whilst he was putting them to bed all o was thinking was "God I want that man right now!"
i2ymiq,Ngl, my man said it first... WHILE we were having sex and after only knowing each other like a month and a half. I was like üò≥ even though I felt that way too but was leery of giving voice to it that early. We have now been together over a year, are in the planning stages of buying a house together and literally could not be happier. Sometimes things just fall into place and it just works. We both came from horrible relationships prior and have our baggage but we put in the work to support each other and we are committed to making it work. I hope nothing but the best for both of you.
i2ymiq,My ex told me he was falling in love with me on the first date lol. We had a wonderful relationship and said it for real three weeks in. Sometimes when you know, you know. And I would have been the person calling me stupid before I experienced it üòÇ
i2ymiq,If anything I feel like that‚Äôs really a perfect time? It‚Äôs been about 7 months, he wanted to finally introduce you to his kids, it seemed to be a great night it just seems like a natural progression. When my boyfriend said he loved me for the first time I also didn‚Äôt say it back to him üòÖ I just needed time to process it as I‚Äôd never been in a relationship so good before. He‚Äôs widowed, so he may just need time to process it too! Don‚Äôt think it over too much, things seem to be just fine. I wish you guys the best of luck :)
i2ymiq,I think it's different for every couple. If I had to guess, I would say you don't have anything to worry about (seeing as he introduced you to his children, and hugged you tighter). I don't think you scared him away. However, he may not be quite ready to say it back, since there is likely some complicated feelings surrounding his late wife. I would just continue on as normal, unless he brings it up with you directly. Or bring it up with him in a while, if he still hasn't said it back. Open communication solves a lot of problems before they start. üëç
i2ymiq,Thank you for your response. I think I totally overthought this. You're totally right, there's no real set amount of time and I have been with him for 8 months (I was focusing too much on the fact we just had sex forbthe first time!)
i2ymiq,He‚Äôs probably just not ready, it happens sometimes, especially considering he‚Äôs a widow. Me and my partner are younger than you and we said I love you at 3 months and that‚Äôs only because I was too nervous to say it at 1 and a half, and we see each other with a little less frequency.That said, if another 6 months passes and he hasn‚Äôt said it back yet, it may be worth checking in with him in the most non-confrontational way possible just to get an idea of where he‚Äôs at on it. Just say it‚Äôs not a problem that he hasn‚Äôt but you would like to know why, hopefully he‚Äôll be comfortable enough to have that conversation
l26ac6,You've been dating him three months, and he's screamed at you three times. When you talked to him about it, he did not say he would adjust his behavior - he said this is what he does when he is stressed and that you need to just deal with it.Unless you want to live the rest of your life with your partner screaming at you until you cry every time he gets stressed... you should walk away.
l26ac6,I feel like so many people put way too much effort into relationships that don't deserve to be saved. Ending a relationship doesn't equal failure. Dating is like taking a trial run of your future partner. If it doesn't work for you it's perfectly okay to return it. If she feels this way three months in, time to return it and try another, next time with a bit more experience under her belt.
l26ac6,This comment.... Please don't ignore his actions. It's only 3 months. I promise it will only get worse. You deserve better. You communicated a boundary and he disrespected that multiple times in just 3 months.
l26ac6,Some things are deal breakers.
l26ac6,Yes. Plus (if you want kids) you will have to try to protect them from similar behaviour.You are done with him. And that's a good thing. It only took him 3 months for him to show you that he's not worthy of you.
l26ac6,It actually could be worse than just that‚Äôs how he is when he is stressed. He could be treating boundaries for example and get worse and more angry. I hope she doesn‚Äôt stick around to find out.
l26ac6,Sounds like it's time to move on. You've been together for 3 months and he's pushed your strong boundary 3 times already. I don't see it getting better
l26ac6,Seriously, still in prime honeymoon stage and he‚Äôs already yelling at her once a month.
l26ac6,And he can control it, bet you he doesn‚Äôt go off on his boss or friends
l26ac6,I have A LOT of dating experience and my current relationship is 4 years, soon to be 5. He has NEVER yelled at me. Not even so much as raised his voice. No one Ive ever dated has ever yelled at me.Please stop dating this person.
l26ac6,Same. I dated a very stressed out boy in college for three months, and he never got angry at me or raised his voice. I‚Äôve been dating my partner for a year and a half, and we don‚Äôt raise our voices either. We both hate it when people yell.I know i‚Äôm capable of it because I have yelled at people who have disrespected me and made me angry, and it‚Äôs a nasty habit my brother and I picked up from growing up together. But i know how terrible that would make my partner feel and how badly it would fuck them up with anxiety, so I could never imagine doing that to someone I love.Let alone calling that person up specifically to yell at them and make them cry. That‚Äôs practically pathological.
l26ac6,Sounds like you're done with him. He's shown you who he can be and he's no longer the same person he was to you anymore. Plus he hurt you and it doesn't even sound like he cares. Calling someone just to scream at them for five minutes straight isn't a healthy way to process anger and if he doesn't see an issue with that or think it's something that needs fixing then he's not worth your energy.
l26ac6,This is your gut telling you that you aren't safe with this person. Your body is telling you that you can't trust them because they may hurt you ...again.  If a stranger yelled at you like that, would you continue to see that person? If your friend yells at you like that, are you trying to see them again? So why does HE get to yell at you like that? Put yourself first.Trust your gut. If he loved you, he wouldn't yell like that.
l26ac6,This is your gut telling you that you aren't safe with this person.Right. And he plainly told her to expect more of this in the future
l26ac6,That numbness is a gift. Please use it and move on without the trap of heartache sucking you back in. People are usually still on their best behavior three months in. If yelling at you this bad multiple times is his "best behavior," I'd hate to find out his worst.
l26ac6,We have only been together for three months.Dump him. 3 months is nothing. He's showing you who he is. Believe him.Find someone who can handle communication like an adult.
l26ac6,If you continue to accept this kind of aggression from your partner, chances are it will only escalate. You can imagine how much more intense these symptoms you experience post-argument will become. Now I don‚Äôt know you but I do know that I do not want that for you. Your mental well-being is clearly suffering from something triggered by his specific actions and it does not have to. Take the first step in a new direction before it becomes too difficult to do so. While it may seem like a lot at once to contemplate and manage, please do strongly consider addressing some of these feelings you‚Äôre having with your doctor or a professional.
l26ac6,He can‚Äôt treat you however he wants depending on his mood. Move on:
l26ac6,Call it quits. You gave him a chance to change and he didn't. Stress is no reason to scream at anyone.He wants you to accommodate his bad behaviour, but he doesn't respect your boundaries. üö©üö©üö©
l26ac6,He went to the effort of calling so he could scream at you!   You said you were texting this is the perfect time for him to put the phone down and take a breath.
mdkjci,This is a very tricky situation. You can keep pushing her and try to get her to see the truth, but there is also the risk that she‚Äôll double down and trust him even more because ¬´he‚Äôs the only one who understandable their love¬ª. If she is spending her fathers money, he needs to cut her off. If the money is for rent, he should pay the landlord directly and not give the money to her. She‚Äôs a grown woman, but if you‚Äôre correct and she‚Äôs intellectually impared and won‚Äôt see/accept the scam, the people around her must step in to stop enabling the situation. If the money dries up the scammer will get impatient and will probably become more desperate/nasty and maybe then she‚Äôll see that he isn‚Äôt a good guy.
mdkjci,She is 32. Her dad needs to cut her off completely. Not go behind her back and pay her bills. She is being willfully ignorant. It is time for her to see the consequences of her actions.Unless she has a legit mental illness.
mdkjci,Honestly, I think you are taking the right approach given her mental age.I think you just need to keep asking questions but I think you need to include some leading questions rather than just 'yes/no' responses.Ask her things like:How do you think a boyfriend should treat his girlfriend?Does he treat you that way?What do you want out of a relationship?Does he give you what you need?What is a healthy relationship?Give her a chance to evaluate this situation without being made to feel stupid. Let her find her own conclusion and support her when she finally reaches it. Scammers feed these kinds of people the idea that it's them against a world that wants to rip them apart. To the fix is not being actively against the scammer and getting the victim to figure it out on their own.Of course, making sure she's cut off from any money (change banking passwords, etc) is important but as far as growing from this experience and NOT doing it again, she's going to have to learn that on her own.
mdkjci,With her intellectual limits and the urgency of this situation, I think it's better to be clear and direct with her than to give her a maze of questions and expect her to come to the right conclusion.
mdkjci,It sounds like your friend needs a guardian tbh to manage her finances.  Even if you get her out of it this time, the world is full of scammers looking to separate people like your friend from their money.
mdkjci,You can't just take away someone's rights because you don't like her decisions. Many mentally competent people get scammed. OP didn't say that she was intellectually impaired, just that she was immature and naive. It sounds like she is able to manage her bills, with a bit of help from her Dad because she doesn't earn a lot.
mdkjci,I don't have great advice, but this is happening to my mother right now. She's imploded her life over a man she has three photos of and has never seen on video. She's acting like a lovesick rebellious teenager at 72. She was kicked out of the place she was living and is no longer speaking to anyone who does not enable this fantasy.She started planning a wedding after "knowing" him for two months. He claims to live in her city, but work overseas doing "contract work". His arrival date back "home" has shifted since January. He supposedly makes 400k a year, but still needs money from her. There are days at a time she doesn't hear from him. It's so clearly a scam, but she's so convinced that she is right and in love and that everyone else is being "unfair" to him.It's heartbreaking, but the path forward for me right now is just not letting it drag me down as well. I could spend every ounce of my mental energy anguishing and it still wouldn't do any good.I know that's not the advice you're looking for, but it's all I have to offer being in a similar spot.
mdkjci,Similar thing with a distant relative. She literally divorced her husband because he wouldn‚Äôt let her sell their house to send this guy more money. Supposedly not romantic, but she ‚Äúfeels bad for him he needs the money‚Äù.Sigh.
mdkjci,Dr Phil has shown these ladies that these guy aren't real and they still refuse to believe it. They ended up living on a friend's couch after they sold their house, their car, emptied their retirement accounts, been involved with law enforcement over money laundering, etc.  For all the money they spent, they could have bought a real live gigolo here in the states.  They're in love with the fantasy.
mdkjci,Goingnto copypasta what I replied to OP.Ok, I went through aomething similar where my mom got scammed similar to this. Mom was desperate for anpartner, he made her fall for him then askes for money so he could get to the country.This may not work for your friend, but here goes... try to find out as much as you can about what she knows about the guy. Name, job, what they talked about recently, anything. Then start digging. Google everything. If the guy is a scammer, it is a good chance your friend was not the only one he scammed.When I did this I found forums where other scam victims talked about the guy who scammed my mom. Photos of him, same stories he told my mom. Messages he sent her pretty much verbatim - those were tailored and he was reusing them with many.The photo was the way in for me. When I had all my research  done, links saved I came to my mom and asked "hey isnthis him by any chance?" Then I showed her more. When she got to read the same messages, it started to dawn on her and we somehow (don't remember the details now tbh) worked through to her cutting ties and not sending any more money. Even this didn't happen in a day, it was like a week long process during which I tried to continue diggimg as deep as I could, supplying her with more and more evidence. Different forums, different accounts of eventa from different person with matching facts on the guy...Not saying itxs a 100% foolproof way, but it's something that worked for me.
mdkjci,I‚Äôm so sorry, I went through the same thing with my mom (hence my username - I made a reddit account to ask for help). It‚Äôs shitty to deal with it and make boundaries but I‚Äôm glad you are. I didn‚Äôt have much support myself because a lot of people don‚Äôt understand. If you ever need anyone to vent to feel free to reach out
mdkjci,If your friend is developmentally delayed, you might look into Adult Protective Services and see if the could offer advice. They deal with adults whose mental or physical condition place them at risk for abuse or exploitation, so adults with mental disabilities would qualify I think. However, if you mean "IQ of a 12 year old" as in someone for whom the phrase "bless your heart" was invented I don't know there's much anyone can do.If she's using her dad's money, and that puts him in a position where he can't pay for rent or bills, he may be being abused even if your friend does not intend to. If your friend is legit mentally disabled, it sounds like they need a guardian or caregiver to manage their finances until they can better learn life skills. Does the dad know about what's going on? I'm sure he's going to find out once he can't pay his rent...
mdkjci,Yeah, I have questions about the 'simple minded' thing. Is she actually impaired, or is she just kinda dim? It very much so influences the potential help or solutions available.E.g., I have a friend who is hugely sheltered and naive, and has a similar response to dealing with contradictory/confronting information that OP described (withdrawing and not acknowledging it). Because he's so sheltered and inexperienced, sometimes talking to him does feel like talking to a teenager. I could absolutely see him falling for this kind of scam - but he's not developmentally delayed, just a product of his upbringing and a NEET lifestyle.
mdkjci,How is this woman accessing the money to send to this scammer? How come she has access to her dad's money if she has the mental abilities of a 12-year-old? Does she live independently and have a job? I think you're focussing on the wrong thing. You may not be able to convince her that she's being scammed. But it sounds like her family might be able to put measures in place to stop her sending money.
o3nr2n,These people don‚Äôt really sound like friends.If they‚Äôre not making you feel good and supported and/or you don‚Äôt feel like you get back what you give, cut ties and move forward. You deserve people in your life who will be there when you need them and who won‚Äôt make you feel so awful at the time when you need them most.So sorry for your loss. I hope you can hang in there and process/heal, despite this lack of support!
o3nr2n,I was going to say this. I would understand if they had a reason they couldn‚Äôt go, but I would imagine they would still make sure ‚Äúto be there‚Äù if they couldn‚Äôt physically ‚Äúbe there‚Äù with you- if that makes sense.
o3nr2n,Maybe a grief support group could both be helpful for OP and a way to connect with potential new friends who understand where he‚Äôs coming from? Or some other interest/hobby group if it‚Äôs helpful to get some distance and distraction from the grief. Friendships have a lifespan and OP, you deserve to have people in your life who will understand and support you during hard times, and trust me, they are out there.
o3nr2n,Going to disagree slightly with this: Friendship isn't a yes/no proposition; a friend who breaks his promise to show up for your mom's funeral might still be a friend to shoot pool with on a Tuesday night.  It's just that your experience shows you what level of effort he's willing to extend to foster your friendship (not much).  So it may be the case that you demote this person from "best friend" down to "friendly acquaintance".  Or not; my point is that you aren't stuck in an all-or-nothing situation with this guy.  You can choose what level of friendship works with him and you (and that can always change as your needs and his behaviors change, too).  I mention this possibility of keeping him around as a bench-warmer friend vs. an all-star because you're clearly in a rough spot, and need to have a support system around you.
o3nr2n,I've been in a similar situation, my two best friends of 15+ years weren't present at my father's funeral. Even if I understood why they were not by my side, although it was a choice they made, it still was a hard pill to swallow. I can't speak for your friends but you should know them enough to know if they are willing to really support you after your loss. You should openly talk to them, tell them your feeling and how you wish to be helped, maybe they just don't know how to act. I don't want to be mean, but if they are not willing to listen and care about your struggles, they're probably not  the "great friends" you are afraid to loose. I'm sorry for you're loss, stay strong.
o3nr2n,I'm struggling to understand how one could "just forget" about their close friends' mom's funeral when they live together. The one who had to work I can kind of understand because if he didn't have any accrued time off and the supervisor was a buttnugget they might not have been allowed to take time off to go. But the guy you live with? That's super fucked up.I know it will be hard, but I would think about speaking openly with them about how you're feeling, what you're dealing with, and that you need their support and understanding. Hopefully they will be understanding and apologize for their selfishness and neglect as friends. If you are a religious person, maybe there is a local religious organization you could go to. I was going through a really hard time a few years ago and the people at my church back home were so nice and welcoming, having that community really helped a lot. If you are not religious, maybe there are support groups for people grieving the loss of a family member. There may even be Facebook groups in your area too. I'm sorry for your loss and it will be difficult, but I'm sure you will make it through!
o3nr2n,Because they said they would go, that's the trigger point for me.  They didn't forget, they just chose not to go, and then gave excuses.Being your best friends, they should be somewhat familiar with your family as well, even to the point that out of respect to the family, they would have probably gone on their own even if you didn't ask them to.Do with that what you will.
o3nr2n,They MAY have forgotten. But that doesn't excuse it. If you say you'll do something, you put reminders on your phone/calendar so you don't forget - especially if it's something as important as a funeral. I have ADHD and the worst memory in the world, and even I don't forget commitments because I make sure my phone reminds me about it.So they might have forgotten, but if they did forget it's because they didn't care enough in the first place to actually write it down.
o3nr2n,Honestly, no friends is better than fake friends/users. These guys are just gonna take and take and take.
o3nr2n,This situation sucks for you. Honestly spare yourself a whole load of pain by dropping them. There's a quote from Robin Williams that's says "It's better to be alone than to be around people who make you feel lonely"
o3nr2n,Advice from Robin Williams' doesn't exactly feel like sound advice to follow - the man committed suicide.
o3nr2n,You need to find better friends. This is purely a them problem and not a You Problem. They aren‚Äôt good friends. And, unfortunately since they didn‚Äôt show up, and continue not to‚Äî you now have proof you CAN survive this without those two particular friends. There are people who will support you. Even strangers.
o3nr2n,I totally agree with this. OP, you need better friends and it‚Äôs really hard to make friends.  So, make a list of fun things you like to do (as an example, hiking, board games and tree planting). Find a local hiking club and join it.  Find a board game cafe, call the owner and find out if they have open games night where you can meet people.  Look for local re-forest/ tree planting places you can volunteer.    <insert your hobbies/interests above>You‚Äôll meet people at these places.  You‚Äôll find better friends.   You deserve better friends.
o3nr2n,Death is strange. I lost a few ‚Äúgood close‚Äù friends after the unexpected and devastating loss of my father. I didn‚Äôt notice it at the time but once my grief calmed down I realized that certain people who I spoke with regularly before had never even sent their condolences when I emailed or texted them. I even had two co-workers who literally ran away from me to avoid giving condolences after I returned to work. I‚Äôve since decided that People who do this kind of stuff don‚Äôt have the capacity or will for the kind of empathy required to be present for tragedy. These two friends aren‚Äôt prepared to offer to help you much less be asked to help you. In this moment they have shown they are not your shoulder to cry on. It hurts, they‚Äôre seriously shitty people to act this way but there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it and I think holding on to them may cause even more pain.Look to those who have reached out to you during this time. Death brings out the absolute worst in people you‚Äôd never expect it from. On the flip side is also shows you the best and kindest moments from people you hardly know. For now focus on yourself and you family.I‚Äôm sending you virtual hugs. Don‚Äôt forget to let yourself feel everything your heart wants don‚Äôt try to push away your happiness pain or anything in between
o3nr2n,The fuck is wrong with people?? I had a friend for nearly 20 goddamn years and when my mom died, she lost her friggin mind. First she asked me if she could catch cancer from my dead mother's belongings.  Then she asked me to make sure Moms funeral wouldnt coincide with some yoga- guru trip she had planned. And then when she found out her ex boyfriend (who had been my roommate and knew my mother very well) intended to come pay his respects, she decided to not only blow off the funeral, she never voluntarily spoke to me again.20 years- I put 20 years and a lot of energy into being her friend, only to find that while I had been hers... she had NEVER been mine. And youd think it would've hurt me to lose her, but youd be wrong. I was mad, but my feelings weren't hurt. I dont think I'm even mad anymore. I look back and I still am impressed by her gall, but I dont feel anything about it. I tell you that to tell you this: like my own mother, YOUR mom did you one last solid on her way out. She showed you who your friends are. Those asswipes arent your friends.Take the lesson.
o3nr2n,Unfortunately, it's really, really common. Unless you've lost someone, people just don't know how to deal with it..so they don't. I'm part of a grief group online and I can't tell you how many of the members lost frienda
o3nr2n,I hear that you've been through a lot of loss and are struggling so I think that you shouldn't make any rash decisions about your friends not being at a funeral right now. I strongly urge you to seek out either a therapist/counselor or a grief support group as that would help you far more than anything else right at this moment. Good luck to you, OP. It sounds like you have far too much on your plate.
o3nr2n,Your friends had the choice to attend and be there for you. But they decided that it wasn't a priority. No true friend would leave you to mourn by yourself especially when losing a parent..Were they there before and after the funeral? If you answered no, then your friends don't see you the way you do to them and it's time to just downgrade them to acquaintances. You make time for the people who are important to you. And it doesn't seem to be the case with your friends.I (31F) have gone through a similar situation and I can honestly tell you, that you will lose friends as you age and mature. The experiences you will go through, will change your perspective of things and you will see how you no longer fit in with your old friends. It sucks, but you will go through this a couple of times as you grow but you will find true friends who have gone through a similar experience and will be able to give you as much love and support as you give them.I'm sorry you lost your mother. I'm sorry about your doggy too. I lost my dog in 2018 and it was one of the most heartbreaking things I had to go through. But you will get through this. Talk to your sibling or go to therapy. It really helps. And remember, be kind to yourself. You deserve love, you deserve true friendship, you deserve happiness.  Always remember that. You will get through it, I promise.
o3nr2n,I'm so sorry about your mom. I really am. My dad died of Covid in January and the pain is still so raw, if I thought about it for 2 seconds I would fall apart.Anyway, I know you think that you are keeping the peace with these buddies of yours because you need their support but what you are actually doing is harming you not aiding you. What's done is done. They have shown you who they are. You see,  it actually IS a big deal to flake on a friend who has lost a parent,, and you are doing a disservice to them by letting it go like it isn't an issue.It absolutely sucks to have to pull away from your life and responsibilities to be there for someone who lost a parent but WE DO IT ANYWAY! Because it's the decent and right thing to do. This isn't like they flaked on giving you a ride to the airport. This is another level.Set your boundaries, move on from these friends. You don't have to go ham but definitely draw a line in your friendship (even if you do it quietly) so that at least in your head you know you are firm and then let me assure you, you are worth it.It actually is better to be alone and have self worth than to be relying on people who don't give a shit.I'm here if you want to talk.-
o3nr2n,Same happened to me. I did not text her after that day and have not talked to her to this day.
n82liq,It shows a lack of respect for you, that he cares so little for your safety. So you have to protect yourself. Don't take the bus to your boyfriend's house anymore. Make him take the 4 hour trip to see you. If he complains or refuses, then you will know how little he valued your efforts. (Also if he refuses, turn his words back on him: "Don't be such a p-ssy!') ;)Seriously though, you cannot make your boyfriend understand the danger you are in, because he has purposely chosen not to believe you. This is a deliberate decision on his part. His convenience to have you come to his house is more important to him than your safety. I'm going to say that again. His convenience is more important to him than the possibility that you could be bodily harmed.If it was me, learning that about my boyfriend, I might take a couple of days to think hard and consider whether this is a person I want to continue giving my time and effort to. I wish you good luck.
n82liq,Don't take the bus to your boyfriend's house anymoreBetter yet, don't ever talk to the boyfriend again. He's a trashbag.
n82liq,The fact that it‚Äôs just an hour trip instead of a four hour bus ride shows that the bf just doesn‚Äôt care about her time or her safety at all.
n82liq,Time to get a new boyfriend I‚Äôm afraid, this one ain‚Äôt it. Anyone who would call you a pussy for being scared of being assaulted by your ex again after he‚Äôs already assaulted you once needs to be removed from your life post-haste. The fact that he said you were overreacting after your ex gave you a concussion is unbelievable. On the plus side, if you dump him then you‚Äôll no longer have to make the 4-hour bus trip to his place so you‚Äôll be safer.
n82liq,This. The 4 hour bus trip ain't worth it for a trash ass man.
n82liq,My question is, why can't that man go to her place instead??
n82liq,Oh, it's not unbelievable at all.
n82liq,You are right. Listen to your instincts and DO NOT do long commutes like that when your psycho ex is on the loose. Talk to the police about your options and keep family and friends in the loop.As for your boyfriend. A grown man shouldnt need help to 'realize' that you being physically assaulted is a serious matter.There is something wrong with your bf. He sounds incredibly selfish insensitive immature and just not interested in your well being, treats you like a call girl. Classic example of losers who date younger women because no one their own age will put up with their BS.
n82liq,Oh so much the last bit! Just reinforced by the fact he thinks you‚Äôre overracting.Even if you didn‚Äôt get seriously hurt, an ex assaulting you is traumatising and that should be enough to take seriously.
n82liq,Sounds like he's just not interested in a relationship like that.  Personally, I think it is a huge red flag, I would have trouble treating people I don't like how heartlessly he treated you.Honestly your choices are accept him being like that or reassess the relationship in total and think if this is someone you wanna trust yourself with long-term.
n82liq,Listen. He's telling you very clearly he's not that into you,
n82liq,It doesn‚Äôt sound like he cares about you very much
n82liq,This man does not care about you in the slightest. Please dump him immediately.
n82liq,He doesn't care that you got hurt. And he's OK with you traveling 4 hours to see him, but he can't be bothered to pick you up at the bus stop? He is absolutely not a keeper. And this is now two duds in a row. Your boyfriend picker is broken. Dump this one and take some time off from boyfriends. Watch your friends who are in good relationships carefully. Watch how they communicate and how they treat each other. Learn what to look for so you don't end up picking three duds in a row.
n82liq,Sounds like your ex isn't the only asshole in this situation. You deserve better than that. And seriously? Your boyfriend called you a "pussy" for getting assaulted and being scared by it? Get rid of him. They both suck.
n82liq,4 hour commute?!?!? And he doesn't want to give you a ride WHEN HE KNOWS YOU WERE PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED!?!?!?! And he's not taking the assault seriously!?!? I dont know what else you need to happen for you to understand your current bf is as much of a loser as your ex.  DUMP HIM.  Are you afraid of being alone or something so you'll accept this type of treatment?  You are better off alone than with him!
n82liq,Please stop taking a 4 hour bus to see this person.If he wants to see you, he can come to you or find a safer bus-alternative (and pay for it).Men make us bend over backwards for them because it gives them a sense of control, power, and/or because they don't care enough to change the circumstances.The right man will move heaven and earth to be with you. It's a hard lesson to learn, but it's the truth.
n82liq,OP, obviously the most pressing issue here is the one of your personal safety. The correct course of action here would be to stop taking the bus to visit your boyfriend, and tell your boyfriend this is not up for discussion. Whether or not this means the end of the relationship is up to him, and frankly, it's always good when the trash takes itself out.But, the overarching issue here is that you lack self-esteem, and this causes you to choose to involve yourself with men who abuse you and have no respect or concern for you and only prioritize their wants over your needs.I'll be honest, unless it were an emergency, I wouldn't do a 8-hour round trip bus ride for anyone, including my own husband. So why do you do it for your "boyfriend," if he can even be called that?Why do you do something so unreasonable and time-consuming for a man who calls you a "pussy," doesn't care that you were attacked and given a concussion, and refuses to do something as simple as pick up his girlfriend if he wants to spend time with her? To be crass, his dick couldn't be that good, and if he actually considered you a girlfriend instead of just calling you that to get laid, he'd treat you better.You can't change the behavior and character of your abusive ex, or your shit current "boyfriend," and you cannot make them value or care about you. You can only control your own behavior and care for yourself.
n82liq,Why is not taking the bus the best course. Ignore that stupid fucker and go where ever the fuck you want. (Except to the new boyfriends - he's a douchebag.)
n82liq,You're 23. He's in his thirties. Leave him and enjoy your life, he can't get a woman his age for a reason.
n82liq,Right, F/23 and M/31 tells you everything about this relationship.
mfgfef,OP, you made the right choice, and all of his actions since you broke up with him prove it. He's immature and spiteful. When you say he's not making it easy for you, I suggest you reframe that -- he's making it very easy for you! This is who he is. Would you wanna be with this guy for the rest of your life? Someone who can't put himself in your shoes? Is vindictive and lashes out when you are honest with him?Get MAD, OP. Stop listening to him and get angry with him. Block him, stop talking to him, and take this as dodging a bullet. Reach out to some close friends from past eras even if you have lost touch with them recently, and let them remind you who you are in your own right, without this asshole.Good luck.
mfgfef,People definitely show their true colors during a break up!
mfgfef,This is great advice!
mfgfef,And now you know why he couldn't find someone his own age!Congrats on the bullet dodged
mfgfef,Exactly. The woe is me bs makes him sound like a teenager. It‚Äôs obvious why he‚Äôs dating 20 year olds and not ready for marriage.
mfgfef,Yup.Every time on a /relationships post somebody says ‚Äúwhy does everyone say age is a problem‚Äù, well... Very seldom is there no (unpleasant) reason for someone to date half their age.I‚Äôm trying to imagine a 42 year old or something being told she ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt proven herself‚Äù in two years roflmao
mfgfef,What you need to do is block this guy so he doesn't keep having routes to explain why he feels like your victim. thats not healthy.
mfgfef,It gets better, I promise :)It is very difficult to break off a LTR when you still care about someone, and I'm glad you did it now instead of investing more time in a dead-end relationship.he continues to make himself the victim.I think his response says a lot about him, and I typically find this kind of behavior to be a good confirmation that ending a relationship was the right decision.When I asked him what he put up with, he cited a 6-month period where I struggled with depression and he had to provide me with more support than normal. I am appalled that he would hold that over me like I was just being lazy that whole time or somethingIt is appalling. If he's only interested in a relationship when it's "easy," I think this also says a lot about him.I wish you the best. Hang in there.
mfgfef,This is very good and kind advice.Sometimes I just get pissed at how cliche the behavior is, like they couldn‚Äôt even bother to add some variety to the bullshit they‚Äôre pulling? An abusive dude 10 years my senior gave me the same ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt proven yourself‚Äù / ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always the victim there is no other narrative‚Äù / ‚ÄúYour personal health suffering hurts me how dare u‚Äù routine. Punished me for every single health issue, saying he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt sign up for this‚Äù etc.It‚Äôs barbaric and it‚Äôs fucking BORING. Wish they‚Äôd get new material but you don‚Äôt find a whole lot of intellectual curiosity let alone self-reflection among that lot
mfgfef,Yeah, he went after someone young and healthy because he only wants the fun parts of a relationship, not the parts where you actually have to support and take care of your partner.
mfgfef,If he's only interested in a relationship when it's "easy," I think this also says a lot about him.I don't understand what you mean here. He didn't leave her over this. She left him over something else. He supported her through it, apparently without complaining. Then she put him on the spot, asking what he put up with. Caring for a partner in the grip of depression for months is no small potatoes. It sucks, but it is necessary sometimes if a partner you love is going through something like that. She says he stepped up and supported her through it. How does that equate to only being interested in a relationship when it's easy?
mfgfef,Wow, this guy sucks! But seriously, my best advice is to let yourself feel your anger. Don‚Äôt try to get over it or pressure yourself to remember the good times. Just take a little bit to get your anger and sadness out.
mfgfef,You absolutely made the right decision.I married a man 10 years older than I, and I am essentially now his mother and caregiver. This is not the life I intended for myself and I am resentful and lonely.My husband is a kind man, but he only wants to be home in his chair and watch TV. We haven't had sex in 5 years. He never touches me and barely kisses me. He is content to be an old man- while I am attractive, active and full of life. My life makes me sad. This is pandemic year has been horrific living with him and I am considering making some serious changes.Your ex is nothing short of selfish. And don't be surprised if he marries someone else immediately.In the meantime, please redirect your energy into building a new stronger you, live your young life to the fullest and meet wonderful vibrant men who are your age. Have exciting sexual affairs and travel to beautiful places.Any man who dates a woman half is age and has never married is damaged. Don't waste your youth or time on someone who is such a bore. You deserve better.
mfgfef,Your situation sounds heart wrenching. Best of luck on making your much needed changes.I think you're right that OPs ex has issues. I think he hasn't dealt with them and is in a state of arrested development.
mfgfef,Hi. I was in a dead marriage for over a decade. I finally woke up one day and decided that I deserved more. Figuring out who I am post-divorce has been an amazing experience. My only regret is not leaving sooner.
mfgfef,Oh, hun... This breaks my heart for you.Kindness is good in a partner, and something we look for in friendships; it's not enough to build a life on if there is no compatibility.Only you can decide how you want the rest of your life to look. Change is scary, but life is short and ends all too quickly.My Dad died quite suddenly at 60, just as his life had started to improve, after 15 years of somewhat self-inflicted turmoil (he spent those years trying to "rescue" addict members of our family, and damaged a lot of his other relationships in the process).  I'm thankful his life was better toward the end (he finally let go of his need to rescue people who were hell bent on burning their lives down; he began to see their manipulative behaviors and stopped enabling them) , but it makes me sad that he was not mentally capable of extracting himself from the situations that brought him so much angst for his last 15 years.If this is not the life you want, it's within your power to change it...Good luck.
mfgfef,I‚Äôm so sorry this has become your reality. I will definitely take your advice, but I encourage you to do what makes you happy too. You are worth it! I know it takes a lot of courage to make big life changes, but you are in control! I believe in you. If you ever need to talk, don‚Äôt hesitate to PM me.
mfgfef,He also said that even if he had wanted to be married, he wouldn‚Äôt have considered it yet, because I hadn‚Äôt put in enough time in the relationship to earn his trust.Dafuq? It‚Äôs been two years, if he doesn‚Äôt trust you by now, he was never gonna.Good job, OP. Don‚Äôt look back at this disaster‚Äîyou might turn into a pillar of salt.
hr8dzh,I think you say to her "Do you want to hear some advice about that or do you just want to vent?" And then let her know that while you care about her, it's rough to hear her make the same complaints for weeks.
hr8dzh,This is really good advice. I met someone online and the photo he used was about 10 years old, so much so that I barely recognised him. I am sure he thought there was another issue but while the main issue is that we just didn't get on as well in person, I admit that I also couldn't quite get over that the person I had been talking to was so different from what was claimed. If he had used up to date pictures I would still have met up with him but I suspect it was a similar thing to your sister (although in his case he had started to go grey rather than change weight). It does make you feel that they haven't been quite honest, and so plants the doubt on what else are they might not be being honest about.
hr8dzh,This is the most important question to ask someone.My social circle uses the emojis for Wrench (fix) and Ear (listen) as shorthands for this and it's so useful.
hr8dzh,This is great advice.
hr8dzh,I love this and am going to add that sentence to my repertoire: do you want to hear some advice or do you just want to vent?
hr8dzh,That is absolutely incredible advice!!!! Thank you so so much.
hr8dzh,Two thoughts: One, no one likes disingenuous photos. They might have liked you as you are, but having your expectations misled can easily put a quick stop to a potential partner. Two, the other problem is, she doesn't actually like herself as she currently is. People will pick up on that and it's a bit of a turnoff. Hides her weight, not happy about her weight. She needs to either do something about her weight, or accept her new body image.
hr8dzh,Yeah, as a woman I have also experienced this kind of "catfishing" from men in online dating sites. One was really egregious, the dude was like twice the size of the person in his photo. I noped out of that date after 10 minutes. As you say, it isn't even so much the not being attracted to the heavier person, it's the element of deceit and misrepresentation that makes it so infuriating. You feel tricked and duped, and you can't even really say anything because it is so impolite to point out that someone is fatter than they appear in their photo!
hr8dzh,and (3) people have different preferences in terms of their partner's body type, and she's not going to attract guys who are into what she looks like now if her photo is significantly thinner.
hr8dzh,People will pick up on that and it's a bit of a turnoff. Hides her weight, not happy about her weight. She needs to either do something about her weight, or accept her new body image.I completely agree with this. I think the issue is that she is unhappy and that comes off. I think that owning her current body would help her a lot. My whole family doesn't have the best relationship with food so she'll lose a couple pounds for a month or two then gain them all back. She's healthy and that's what really matters. I really think confidence would make a huge difference.
hr8dzh,100% this. Met up with a girl who clearly had used a million filters on her photos. Had I known she would look so surprisingly different in person, I still might‚Äôve been interested, but showing up and getting an entirely different looking person (I call it the quasi-catfish) was just a huge turnoff and really tainted the rest of the date.
hr8dzh,I once was talking to my first girl, she really looked like the type of girl i like, really alternative, into makeup and shit, we had good talks, but when i first saw her i got scared, she was double the size and her overall was nothing like the pictures, i though i was meeting someone diferent, she was quite nice and we had a nice time but she was nothing like i expected and was triple my size, it really put me off.
hr8dzh,You can offer your take on the "why" to her but if she does not want to hear your input then let it go.
hr8dzh,That's fair. I think I didn't convey in the post properly that she often complains to me about it, otherwise I wouldn't care. But I do see what you're saying.
hr8dzh,The next time she complains, I would ask her if she wants dating advice/help sprucing up her profile, or if she just wants you to be a listening ear. Usually people don‚Äôt want advice, unless they ask for it, imo. Usually people just want someone to be sympathetic. You don‚Äôt have to fix this problem for her!If you are getting sick of listening to her complain, you can gently let her know that her venting is taking over the conversations between you two and you‚Äôd like to focus on something else.
hr8dzh,Thank you!
hr8dzh,I‚Äôve had a friend that met a few girls from a dating apps that used their old slender photos of themselves . He was always polite on the first date but was honest if these chicks would approach him for a second date. He‚Äôd flat out say, hey I‚Äôm not interested, it felt like you weren‚Äôt honest with me and honesty is a big deal to me. I‚Äôm surprised none of her dates have flat out told her
hr8dzh,I really think no one says anything because it's so taboo to make any comments about a person's weight. It's also just not smart to give people "reasons" you don't want to date them, because that opens it up to them arguing with you about whether your reasons are valid. Saying something generic like "sorry but I didn't feel a connection, best of luck" is much less stress and mess than giving the person a truthful criticism that might offend them and cause them to lash out at you.
hr8dzh,Add me to the people who think asking her if she is looking to vent vs advice, then do that.
k7ynxu,You should file a police report for harassment. You should also report her behavior to HR (if your work has an HR). You may want to talk to a lawyer about additional options about you--e.g. if she's making up lies about you to other people, you may be able to bring slander charges.As for the boyfriend thing...if he believes her over you, I'm not really sure that you can fix things with him (or should want to). He's supposed to be on your side and the fact that he bought what she was saying without getting your side of it suggests that he isn't a loyal partner (and your partner should be loyal).
k7ynxu,This is perfect. But also, don't u dare quit your job. Unless you originally wanted to!
k7ynxu,I agree with this. I think filing a police report should be considered ASAP, because it will immediately put her on notice that her behavior has crossed a line. The boss may also get in trouble too because it sounds like he hasn't really done a lot to combat his (former?) girlfriend from harrassing his employee, so his negligence could be contributing to a hostile workplace. I also think OP could look into any civil damages for this behavior since it seemed to cost her her relationship with her boyfriend.I personally wouldn't quit the job if it were me. I don't know that you can claim unemployment if you quit. Instead, they'd have to fire me. Not only could I claim unemployment, I would also sue them for the behavior they subjected me to.Also for OP: be sure to keep track of all conversations with this woman and her friends, and take contemporaneous notes about their behavior and the impact it is having on you. My preferred way of doing this is to send emails to myself because they are timestamped. Any text message, social media DM, or email she sends you could be considered evidence.
k7ynxu,I think a police report is a great way to have this on the record, even if they don't pursue anything
k7ynxu,Go to the police. This is harassment.
k7ynxu,No, contact the police immediately. You are being harrassed and likely slandered.Wtf kind of advice is contact if it continues. Clearly they have no intention of stopping after such intense harrassment.
k7ynxu,I don‚Äôt want to go to HR because his dad is the CEO so I feel like they‚Äôll protect him..
k7ynxu,Contact HR and the police. Your place of employment shouldn't be the reason you're receiving threatening messages and this is caused directly from your boss and HIS gf/ex. Don't quit!
k7ynxu,Yes. What HR cares about is liability to the company. Your boss and his failure to separate his personal and professional life is a liability to the company,
k7ynxu,Document EVERYTHING. Past, current, future encounters. Have security cameras in your office? Take the footage. Contact your HR rep and file an incident report. Save the evidence in a secure location. Change your number, call the non-emergency police line and ask to file a police report due to stocking and harassment. Contact a lawyer and talk to them about how to file a restraining order on the ex and her friends. Also talk to the lawyer about suing for slander, emotional trauma, and potential lost wages if you do end up quitting your job. Also, if you won your lawsuit, talk about whether you can sue for legal fees as well since you didn‚Äôt ask for this.Look into getting pepper spray that you can store on a key chain. Read the manual on how to use it (don‚Äôt spray it into wind, etc.) Also read your local laws on using it but pepper spray is typically safe across the USA.Also, keep in mind that your employer is doing jack shit to protect you (as of right now). That in itself is concerning. You could very well potentially sue your employer for failing to take reasonable actions to protect their employees from a crazy ex GF. This is why it‚Äôs important to reach out to HR and ask for copies of everything they fill out. Send it via email and then forward the email to yourself. Create paper trails for everything. Your employer might be feeding you today but they might also become part of the problem if they don‚Äôt take reasonable measures to ensure employee safety and something happened to you out of the office but especially if you were in the office.People are bat shit crazy so don‚Äôt take this lightly.P.S. fuck your insecure ex. If he can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs going on then you don‚Äôt want him in your life anyways.Best of luck
k7ynxu,This must be a small company.Change your phone #.Lock down your social media,Forget the boyfriend.HIRE a GOOD LAWYER!!!!
k7ynxu,Call the police! If there is a HR or your bosses boss then go to them too.
k7ynxu,Get a restraining order.
k7ynxu,File a police report for harassment. And this might be shady, but since she's screwed over you at work for litterally no reason, if you can find out where she works, maybe contact her boss and somehow drop that she's doing this. It'll definitely make her look bad. Or leave a bad review about her at her job or something. Karma!
k7ynxu,Please don't quit your job, none of this is your fault.Talk to HR, even if his dad is CEO. Chances are your ex is harassing your boss as well and your formal complaint will help out his situation too.
k7ynxu,Harassment of this intensity might need the Police to get involved. Save messages and keep a journal about it.Concerning your boyfriend. Has he had cause to wonder about your relationship with your boss? Late nights, contact after work or weekends? Has he expressed anything in the past about the professionalism or closeness of the Boss toward you or vice versa?He may have insecurities about the relationship, or has seen warning signs that you haven't because you are too close to the situation to see?I ask these things or bring them up only because we are seeing only your side to it, and that it seems a bit weird he would take her side on this. Remember we can only help with the information given. If you leave anything out it will limit our ability to see the situation.I can only see so much from my couch üõã.
k7ynxu,The only thing he's complained about is that my boss makes me work overtime at a short notice a lot so I sometimes have to cancel on him because of that. He hasn't mentioned anything else but his last GF cheated on him so I feel like that might be playing into his decision.
k7ynxu,Your boss is enjoying the drama.   He likes seeing what extremes his ex will go to in order to get him back, AKA what she'll do to you to get him back.You need to document all this.  Make screenshots, whatever.   Take copies to HR.  If they don't do anything,  find a lawyer and take it to court.   You shouldn't have to deal with your boss's psychotic ex and his narcissism.
mmlzx5,You tell her and leave. Sorry, but she doesn‚Äôt have to accept it. Her agreement or acceptance isn‚Äôt required. Yes it‚Äôs tough, I‚Äôve been there, but when you decide it‚Äôs over...it‚Äôs over
mmlzx5,Yeah what you said. All I hear is "my ex wont accept I ended it"I've been on both sides. And unfortunately. She doesnt have to accept it. It is what it is. Hopefully she leave you alone soon
mmlzx5,I hated to do.it, but once I had to break up with a guy over text. We had a lot of issues but whenever I tried talking to him about it he'd freak out and threaten to kill himself. I'd cave but things would never change. He even started avoiding me which made no sense to me, cause if he wanted to be with me so badly why wasn't he around? So I sent him a long text before work, he tried calling me a bunch but I couldn't answer him. He texted me back about how it was my fault he'd be dead, but he's still alive today. Sometimes you have to just cut the chord.
mmlzx5,I can absolutely relate to this. I was 14 and my bf at the time told me that he'd kill himself if we ever broke up. It made me feel very uncomfortable about our relationship, and I no longer wanted to be part of it. So I called him over the phone (at the time texting wasn't popular yet) and I broke things off and we talked things out for awhile before going our separate ways.Happened again with another ex I had. Called to break up, he said some concerning suicide threats, I drove over to make sure he was okay. He tried to surprise kiss me so that I'd stay with him. I reiterated that things where truly over and than I left his home.Both ex's are alive and well to this day. It was all just manipulation at the time.
mmlzx5,I had a friend who had to call her bf‚Äôs mom bc he would literally send videos and pics of him with a gun to his head when she tried to leave him. She tried one time in person and she said he scared her so bad she took it back. We were 16 and since then I have always broken up with my partners on the phone.
mmlzx5,I had an ex to this to me so many times that when I was over him doing that to get me to stay, I called the police to do a welfare check because he was threatening suicide. I had the texts to prove it! He was so pissed at me for the police & crisis people showing up at his house that he gave me the silent treatment!  ü§£
mmlzx5,damn, threating with suicide sounds awful, I'm glad you made it out of there!
mmlzx5,I am usually of the opinion text breakups are wrong but damn you 100% get a pass for that one.
mmlzx5,I had the same thing happen! I'm so glad in the end it ended over a text. Can't be cornered or manipulated or talked over like on the phone. I feel you sister, hope life is going well for you after all that
mmlzx5,Which chord though? I'm thinking Cm7.
mmlzx5,At this point after 10 tries she probably doesn't think of it as a breakup so much as a "warning" conversation.  If you really do want to break up, untangle any entanglements you have with her first, then say you're sorry for seeming indecisive but you are sure you want to break up.  You can have a full on conversation with her after that if you want but your alternative is to just stop answering the phone/ the door/ etc and just be firm.
mmlzx5,Just tell her it is over. Period. A breakup is not a negotiation.  You are ending the relationship. She can make threats/promises all she wants, but it is DONE. Do not accept no as an answer to your statement of ending shit.
mmlzx5,That was going to be my advice as well. She plays on his emotions when they are in person. He‚Äôs tried multiple times. Since she uses manipulation to force him to stay, she doesn‚Äôt get the curtesy of an in person break up. Op, text her that you‚Äôre done, then block her. You shouldn‚Äôt have to continue to be unhappy just to keep her happy.
mmlzx5,Second on the blocking. That's necessary for a love bomber like her
mmlzx5,Leave. Just leave.  Send her one final message and never look back.There's no point staying in a relationship where everything may have (already had maybe)  to becoming  a toxic relationship.You deserve to be happy,  she deserves to be happy too.  But if she refuses to see the truth time to hit her with reality.
mmlzx5,At 10 tries?Just text her it‚Äôs over. You tried to do it the right way in person and she played the ‚Äúimma cry and beg‚Äù card.Just text, block number, feel bad for a bit and try to move on.
mmlzx5,^ Yup, do this."Babe, you're dumped.  Don't call me.  It's you, not me."
mmlzx5,Yeah, this isnt that complicated. You tell her "im breaking up with you" and maybe list your reasons, you get up and you leave. Thats it.
